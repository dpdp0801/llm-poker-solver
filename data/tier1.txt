Dominate the River in 3-Bet Pots OOP
Playing the river may seem scary. Pots, on average, have been swelling up big time at this point, and even small mistakes can mean a substantial loss of big blinds. But do not panic because after digesting this article, you will be ready to outplay your opponents and maneuver as the preflop aggressor (PFA) from out of position (OOP) through all kinds of challenging river spots in 3-bet pots. Let‚Äôs get our feet (and hands) wet by immersing ourselves in the world of rivers!

Impact of Earlier Streets
As discussed in the previous article ‚ÄúMastering Turn Play in 3-Bet Pots OOP,‚Äù earlier streets have significant consequences for our game on later streets. How we construct our turn range will always affect how we play the river.
Let‚Äôs examine the following scenario more closely to understand how turn play impacts our river game plan.
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs turn barrel strategy vs BTN on K93tt 2r (after flop went B20-C)
After frequently betting for a small sizing on the flop, the SB arrives with an extensive range on the turn, and so does the BTN. Due to the excellent pot odds, IP has to defend very wide versus a 20% flop c-bet.
Hands like second pair (9-x) and underpairs (TT‚ÄìQQ) are, therefore, still strong enough to bet again for a small sizing. They get called by worse pairs and benefit from protection by denying a decent amount of EQ. On the other hand, the SB still has a notable number of hands that want to build even larger pots, such as strong King-x, two pairs, and sets. These hand classes would prefer a bigger turn sizing.
We can now use different turn strategies. Let us determine how splitting the betting between a small (20% pot) and big (75% pot) turn sizing will impact how we play the river on a board-pairing nine.

River After Small Turn Barrel
First, let us explore the river after betting small on the turn. When we take a look at the ‚ÄúRanges‚Äù tab and the ‚ÄúEquity chart,‚Äù a couple of things stand out immediately:
The SB shows up with a considerable advantage on the river! Betting 20% on the turn allows OOP to include a good chunk of 9-x, which means OOP rivers some amount of trips, even relatively close to the amount of the IP player.
OOP arrives with more full houses on the river. IP raises their sets and K9 very aggressively on earlier streets versus the small sizes, while we put hands like KK into our small-betting range since they block much of the hands that call bigger bets.
OOP has a significant advantage in TT‚ÄìQQ (underpairs), while IP has way more third pairs. The SB is small-betting the turn a lot with those TT‚ÄìQQ, while the BTN is forced to continue with a notable amount (over 80% of the time) of third pairs versus a 20% bet. This means those underpairs are still worth a small bet on the river in SB‚Äôs shoes because IP has so many weaker pairs.
TLDR: The SB‚Äôs range, in general, dominates IP‚Äôs range. Due to the nature of both ranges‚Äîwith the BTN being forced to continue with an extensive range on the turn (almost 85% of the time) and the SB already having an advantage on flop and turn‚Äîthe SB gets to bet river very frequently with a merged range for various sizes.

River After Large Turn Barrel
To further drive home the point of the impact of turn play, let us now take a glance at our river strategy after using a bigger (75% pot) turn bet:
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs triple barrel river strategy vs BTN on K93tt 2r 9r (after flop B20-C, turn B75-C)
We will, once again, consult the same tools‚Äîthe ‚ÄùRanges‚Äù tab and ‚ÄúEquity chart‚Äù‚Äî to understand what‚Äôs happening. What differences do we notice?
What stands out the most is that the SB now finds themselves at a disadvantage in most of the different range parts. OOP doesn‚Äôt double barrel any 9-x for a large sizing, while IP still defends all 9-x. The BTN also gets to continue significantly less versus the 75% pot bet sizing, which heavily filters IP‚Äôs range and makes it much tighter. IP arrives on the river with almost 3 times fewer underpairs, way fewer bricked draws, and practically no single Ace-high. IP‚Äôs range is much stronger and more concentrated around top pairs and trips.
OOP, conversely, arrives with much more air and even significantly fewer nutted hands on the river. The result is that the SB now has to check a lot and can not use large sizes due to the nut disadvantage that they find themselves in.
The drastic differences in OOP‚Äôs river strategy showcased how important it is to understand how our ranges look on previous streets.
Building an unbreakable river strategy to bridge across requires understanding the foundations laid in the earlier streets because you will be building on top of them.

Why Using Multiple Sizes on the River Is Essential
We generally split our range into multiple sizes because there are various hand classes that explicitly want to bet different amounts to achieve different things. As we examined in the previous articles about playing 3-bet pots OOP, using multiple sizes on earlier streets is not mandatory.
The EV difference between having a more complex strategy with multiple sizes and a simple one with just one size is often very close. The issue is that the difficulty of executing a multi-size strategy will increase drastically compared to the simplified single-size strategy. Splitting our range as early as the flop and/or turn implies a larger game tree with many more nodes and branches that have to be considered and studied. In theory, all these different lines have to be balanced with the right amount of strong hands and bluffs. The following graphic displays the exponential nature of game complexity when using various flop and turn sizes:
On the left, a simpler game tree with one bet size on flop and turn, to only split on the river into two bet sizes.
On the right, a more complex game tree that already splits from the flop onward into two bet sizes.
(Keep in mind that there‚Äôs always the check option as well.)
The complexity of game trees: simpler (12 river nodes) vs more complex (27 river nodes)
We are not robots. Going with a relatively simple strategy that you‚Äôre able to play on a high level will consistently outperform a more complex one where we make way more mistakes and theoretically only gain a minimal amount of EV.
However, there are situations where we certainly want to mix multiple sizes on earlier streets for exploitative reasons, such as spots where our opponents are too passive and do not raise enough versus the small sizing. All our nutted hands would now heavily miss out on value when not enough money goes into the pot. This means we need to take matters into our own hands and use a big sizing for our strongest hands and a smaller one for our marginal hand classes. We don‚Äôt need to concern ourselves with balancing both of our lines as we are purely focusing on what each hand in our range wants. This will always be our highest EV choice versus weak opponents who are unable to counter effectively.
We aren‚Äôt there yet, though; there is one last street to traverse. Once we‚Äôre on the river, splitting our range into multiple sizings becomes indispensable; if you bet small on the flop with a hand that wants to build a large pot, you can still use huge sizes on the river to put in as much money as you wish. After the river, though, the hand ends. We need to find a size now that fits our hand‚Äôs value. When we arrive on the river with distinct hand classes who explicitly want to put in different amounts of money, we must build our strategy around two sizings. Since the hand ends on the river, there is also no future street complexity to worry about.

Now we have learned why splitting the river is mandatory, we are mentally prepared to dive into that strategic complexity. 3, 2, 1, ‚Ä¶

Diving Into the River
Although it might sound counterintuitive, the river is the easiest street to play on. There are no future streets to worry about, and ranges are often more defined and filtered.
However, playing the river is still no child‚Äôs play. Due to all the different rivers, finding a way to get a grip on a strong river strategy can feel elusive. We need to simplify our approach to rivers so we can smoothly navigate through all of them.
Grouping rivers will help us to find patterns and design heuristics effectively.
To get a better understanding of river play, we are going to explore two different groups:
Brick river
Nut-changing river
Dry, Brick Rivers
To portray how to play on cards that don‚Äôt shuffle up the equity distribution of the ranges after the turn action has concluded, we will examine A‚ô†9‚ô£2‚ô• 7‚ô† 4‚ô¶.
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs triple barrel river strategy vs BTN on A92tt 7r 4r (after flop B20-C, turn B75-C): 100bb starting
When reviewing the river strategy, one thing should immediately catch your eye!
The SB mainly has one large (all-in) sizing. The only hand that wants to use a smaller sizing is AJ. AJ only makes up roughly 3.6% of our entire range. When certain hands wanting to use a specific size are very scarce, we don‚Äôt need to bother building a strategy around that.
The question is, why do we just use one large sizing here?
Let us find out together with the help of the EQ buckets and chart!
The EQ buckets and chart on A92tt 7r 4r (left = SB, right = BTN)
What do you notice here? There are two interesting things to find that explain why the SB only wants to go all-in (87% pot):
The EQ buckets and chart from the SB clearly indicate a highly polarized range. The SB has considerably more nutted and strong hands with 80‚Äì100% EQ but also way more very low equity hands (air) below 25% EQ.
The BTN‚Äôs range, however, is dense in bluff-catchers with between 25‚Äì70% EQ. All hands with more than 80% EQ (i.e., AQ and better) are strong enough to go all-in, given that the SPR < 1.
This undoubtedly shows us that due to SB‚Äôs polar nature and the relatively low SPR, they have little‚Äîremember AJ‚Äîto no interest in using a smaller size. This is usually the case on brick river runouts after having polarized previous streets being 100bb deep. We can often simplify to checking or going all-in.
It is important to note that SPR plays an important role here, though!

Deeper Rivers
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs river strategy vs BTN on on A92tt 7r 4r (after flop B20-C, turn B125-C): 200bb starting
When we explore the same spot, but being 200bb deep, we can see that the SB now clearly wants to use non-all-in sizes too. Hands like AK/AQ that were previously strong enough to go all-in, don‚Äôt get called enough by worse when they jam with an SPR of ~1.28 (instead of ~0.86). In this case, it‚Äôs worth building a smaller size around a hand like AK since this hand alone makes up almost 20% of OOP‚Äôs river range in this spot!
Wet, Nut-Changing Rivers
To contrast, we can compare the same spot up to the point where the river card now changes the nuts: a flush-completing 4‚ô•.
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs river strategy vs BTN on A92tt 7r 4t flush-completer (after flop B20-C, turn B75-C): 100bb starting
Comparing the river strategy on the flush-completing 4 demonstrates one thing:
OOP now clearly wants to use one small and one large size. All of SB‚Äôs strong turn hands, such as two pairs or the best top pairs, got devalued on this nut-changing river. They are now only strong enough to bet for a small size. Blocking the river often outperforms checking in nut-changing spots, because we prevent the opponent from checking back all worse hands or re-opening the action for a larger size.
Let‚Äôs switch tabs‚Äîfrom ‚ÄúStrategy‚Äù to ‚ÄúRanges‚Äù‚Äîto examine the reasons for this strategic shift a bit more closely.
The EQ buckets and chart on A92tt 7r 4t flush-completer (left = SB, right = BTN)
The EQ buckets and chart are now slightly different. The BTN gains a significant amount of nutted hands, which severely reduces the SB‚Äôs nut advantage. Due to the nut change, all of SB‚Äôs turn nuts, and very strong hands such as AK or two pairs are now downgraded in the hierarchy of EQ buckets. For that reason, OOP now dominates the buckets between 25 and 80%; it also perfectly illustrates why OOP wants to have a small-betting range: OOP has a lot of medium-strength hands now that still can go for thin value but are too weak to jam.
The slightly more tricky part is now to figure out which size each hand prefers.
Value ‚Äì We need to define a value threshold to determine which hand classes go for what size. Looking at the river strategy, we want to jam with all our sets and better. Our two pairs, AK and AQ, go into our small sizing. A cool heuristic here is that the weakest hand that could have gone all-in on a brick river also fits the threshold for blocking on a nut-changing river. We put some of our flushes into our small size to prevent our small-betting range from becoming too weak. Usually, flushes that heavily block the calling range, like K‚ô•Q‚ô•.
Bluffs ‚Äì Finding the right bluffs for each sizing can be more challenging. But don‚Äôt worry, we got you! Generally, on the river, it comes down to blocking effects:
‚Ä¢  Using bluffs with good blocking effects for our big sizes.
‚Ä¢  And bluffs with poor blocking qualities use the small sizes or just give up.
This begs the question: ‚ÄúWhat are good and bad blocking effects?‚Äù
The answer is: ‚ÄúIt depends‚Ä¶ on what your hand wants to accomplish.‚Äù
When it comes to bluffing hands, look for these effects:
Block calls
Block folds
Unblock folds
Unblock calls
Is your bluff buff?
Let‚Äôs apply this to our river spot:
Good bluffs are hands like KQo with one ‚ô•; these are fantastic combos for the big size, blocking strong flushes and calls like AK/AQ one ‚ô•.
Poor bluffs are hands like 65 that don‚Äôt block the folding range, which is decent, but don‚Äôt block any strong hands. They can go into our small-betting range. They also benefit more from folding out better air, such as T8. So we don‚Äôt need to get many folds to be profitable. Pretty bad bluffs would be hands like JTs, not really blocking calls and mainly blocking villain‚Äôs folds such as AT/AJ.
Note that it isn‚Äôt always possible to be so picky. Sometimes, it‚Äôs also a question of whether you run out of (pretty) bluffs. The fewer bluffs you have to choose from, the less picky you can be.

When Being Allowed to Over-Fold the River
You might have heard about MDF (Minimum Defense Frequency). It describes the minimum amount of hands within your range that you need to defend to remain unexploitable. While this often applies, there are spots where we are allowed to over-fold relative to MDF.
Let‚Äôs look at a practical hand example to see this concept in action. We can use the same spot as before, which has the additional benefit of keeping us in familiar waters.
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs river strategy vs BTN‚Äôs all-in (87% pot) on A92tt 7r 4r (after river X)
After facing a BTN all-in for 87% pot, MDF suggests that OOP must roughly defend 53.5% of their range. As we can see, though, the SB massively over-folds here by only defending 10.8% of range.
As we already determined, OOP‚Äôs range is highly polarized, and IP‚Äôs range mainly consists of bluff-catchers. OOP doesn‚Äôt gain anything from checking strong hands on the river because IP has no incentive to re-open marginal hands into a polarized range built around nuts or air.
The SB-3-bettor‚Äôs first-in river strategy filtered for 80%+ equity
By examining OOP‚Äôs best hands with more than 80% EQ, we can confirm that the SB basically never checks their strongest hands.
The BTN is now able to bluff all their air without getting punished. To be clear, the SB is not getting exploited here. They already gained their EV by polarizing on earlier streets and having no incentive to check the river with strong hands due to the polar vs condensed range dynamics. The BTN doesn‚Äôt get to float all their air on the turn, and then on the river, they just get to hammer into OOP once they check. The SB will often just bet themselves, so IP doesn‚Äôt get much opportunity to bluff. These spots where OOP over-folds the river usually occur when OOP has bet flop and turn with a highly polarized range.
Fascinating to explore because we get to see counterintuitive concepts manifest due to the nature of both ranges.

One Important River Exploit
Exploring theoretical concepts can be very helpful in grasping the complexity of particular spots. It even becomes mandatory to study theory to understand what mistakes our opponents are making and how we can capitalize on them. In practice, we always want to deviate as much as possible to capture the highest EV.
There is one spot in particular where many players leave a lot of money on the table. Instead of simply explaining the exploit, let‚Äôs do a little experiment with our nodelocking tool using custom solutions. Let‚Äôs get in the lab!
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs triple barrel river strategy on K92tt 5r 8t flush-completer (after flop B33-C, turn B67-C): 200bb starting
OOP‚Äôs strategy on the nut-changing 8‚ô¶ dictates a lot of blocking. IP arrives with slightly more flushes and sets on the river. Overall, it‚Äôs a pretty decent card for the BTN.
Let‚Äôs assume we face an overly passive player who is not raising enough versus the block-bet. IP has to raise over 20% facing the small size!
Now, when we nodelock villain to raise only half of the time, by taking out especially the thin value-raises such as specific two pairs or sets. The result is an eye-opener:
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs triple river strategy on K92tt 5r 8t flush-completer after nodelocking IP‚Äôs strategy:
Raise frequency vs block = ~10% instead of ~20%
We are now checking approximately 25% less and using the 2x pot all-in size 4 times as often. Pretty cool, right?
We check significantly less because IP is not raising enough. This means our block sizing realizes more EQ, and we are pushed less often off our hand.
We also use the all-in sizing considerably more because villain is not raising thin enough. Our nutted hands severely bleed EV when they are not getting raised enough. A decent heuristic is that in spots where we know villain is not raising enough, especially with thin value, we don‚Äôt want to put our strong hands into the small size.
Remember that most players in lower- and even mid-stakes games are often too passive, so this exploit will help you outplay many opponents!

Conclusion
Playing the river in 3-bet pots OOP can be tricky. This should not discourage us from seeking new knowledge to fortify our game or pursuing new abilities. The following concepts will help you in your journey to 3-bet pot river excellence as the OOP player!
How we constructed our ranges and influenced our opponent‚Äôs on previous streets is the foundation that a sound river approach is built upon. To avoid slipping up on how to play the river, recall the previous streets‚Äô actions and how that shaped the ranges.
Using multiple sizes on earlier streets is not mandatory. The EV difference is often minimal and doesn‚Äôt make up for the increase in complexity of the game tree, which can cause EV loss itself. River splitting becomes essential in spots with different hand classes to bet. The fact that the hand ends on the river means this is our last opportunity to build a pot of a certain size, and at the same time, we do not need to worry about future complexity.
When we polarized on previous streets, and the river card doesn‚Äôt change the equity distributions, we can often simplify to jamming and checking at 100bb deep. The deeper we are, the more we establish multiple sizings, even on bricks.
We must implement one small sizing for our medium-strength hands on nut-changing runouts.
OOP is often allowed to over-fold in highly polarized river spots after betting flop and turn to then check the river due to the nature of both ranges.
In spots where we know villain is not raising enough versus our small river size, we need to take matters into our own hands. This means putting our strongest hands into our big-betting range to avoid leaving a lot of value on the table.

### TOPIC: 3bet pots oop
Crush 3-Bet Pots OOP in Cash Games
Did you know that 3-bet pots out of position (OOP) as the preflop aggressor make up roughly 5% of all hands you play in a cash game session? 5% might not sound that much, but when you keep in mind that you have already invested a considerable amount of chips, you will realize that these spots significantly influence your win rate.
In this article, we will look closely at this scenario, specifically 100bb deep before and on the flop. The aim is to equip you with all the knowledge you need to cruise through this spot when you encounter them in-game.

Preflop Foundation
Why do we even 3-bet preflop? You might say something like: ‚ÄúWe want to build a pot with all of our good hands.‚Äù And even though this is absolutely correct, it‚Äôs not the only reason why we want to 3-bet out of position before the flop.
Before we pick preflop play apart, I want to make sure the scope of this scenario is clear. 3-bet pots as the OOP preflop aggressor can only occur in the small and big blind.

3-Bet Pots From the Small Blind
SB response vs BTN open-raise (2.5bb): 100bb effective, NL500
This graphic depicts the response of the SB versus a 2.5x open-raise from the BTN when effectively 100bb deep. The first thing we notice immediately is that the SB barely calls anything. Instead, they almost exclusively 3-bet or fold. But why is that?
The three main reasons SB prefers 3-bet only:
The SB always plays out of position. When the BTN open-raises, and we call in the SB, the BB might call too. Now, we are forced to play a multiway pot with a capped range (since we would always have 3-bet our strongest hands to start building a bigger pot) out of position versus multiple opponents. Not the best situation to find ourselves in.
The SB risks a BB squeeze. When we decide to call, instead of 3-betting from the SB, we let everyone know that we don‚Äôt have the strongest possible hands. The BB has the opportunity to notice that and pick up a lot more dead money by increasing their 3-betting frequency. We are now forced to potentially play an even bigger pot out of position with a range that never contains the strongest hands.
Cash games usually include rake that you must pay in every pot as soon as you arrive on the flop and win the hand. Especially at lower stakes, rake can be a huge factor. That‚Äôs why we want to avoid calling too much, primarily when we are out of position. 3-betting allows us to take the pot down before seeing a flop, denying equity and usually not having to pay rake. (There are poker sites like GGPoker that rake preflop, which is why we provide preflop solutions specifically for GG games).

SB‚Äôs 3-Bet Range Construction
Due to the fact that we are going to be out of position the whole time, our 3-betting range needs to be tight and packed with strong hands. The exact range construction depends on the position of the original raiser and the stack depth.
A good rule of thumb is that the deeper you are, the more important it is to select hands that can make the nuts across different runouts‚Äîsuch as high-suited hands‚Äîbecause the (equity) threshold for hands that can go broke increases with an increase in stack size, resulting in a tighter stack off range.
Hands like off-suit broadways go down in value the deeper you get because they can‚Äôt withstand much pressure over multiple streets due to poor nut-making abilities. In general, you can 3-bet wider, the later the position of the original raiser because their range should be wider too. In the graphic above, you can see the optimal SB 3-bet range when facing an open-raise from the BTN.
The deeper you are, the more important it is to select hands that can make the nuts across different runouts‚Äîsuch as high-suited hands‚Äîbecause the (equity) threshold for hands that can go broke increases with an increase in stack size, resulting in a tighter stack off range

3-Bet Pots From the Big Blind
BB response vs BTN open-raise (2.5bb): 100bb effective, NL500
This graphic shows BB‚Äôs optimal strategy when facing a 2.5x open-raise from the BTN, 100bb deep. Two major differences with the SB‚Äôs strategy immediately stand out:
The BB calls way more. The reason is that we have already invested one big blind (resulting in us, as the BB, getting a better price than when we are in the SB). We are also the last player to act, meaning we go directly to the flop and don‚Äôt need to factor in a potential squeeze from someone behind.
The BB does not only 3-bet strong hands. The top of our range plays very similar to the SB‚Äôs top of range: TT+, AJs+, and AQo+ are 3-bet purely. They are our best hands that we like to build a pot with, even when we are out of position. Since the BB is allowed to call way more, a lot of hands that would mainly be 3-betting from the SB vs BTN are now primarily just calling. The reason is that hands like A9s, K8s, or 66 would rather not face a 4-bet from the BTN, and neither really benefit from 3-betting. We can characterize them as too good to 3-bet bluff but also not quite good enough to 3-bet for value.
In order not to become exploitable by our opponents, we need to 3-bet some weaker hands as well. Since we do a lot of calling with our medium-strength hands, we are selecting (more heavily but not exclusively) 3-bet bluffs near the bottom of our calling range. Primarily hands with at least decent playability and good removal effect to BTN‚Äôs very strong hands.
To give you a quick idea of how much we should roughly be 3-betting from the blinds, we created a telling visualization for you:

Postflop Expansion
OOP gameplay can be a serious challenge sometimes. This mostly stems from the fact that realizing our equity becomes an ordeal because we always have to act first. Plus, given that there are so many different flop textures, not knowing where to start can evoke frustration to boot.
There‚Äôs no need to worry, though. You will learn everything you need to overcome these trials.
Comparing 3-Bettors Based on Position
There are two significant differences between 100bb deep 3-bet pots when OOP vs IP. They stand out instantly when we look at the aggregate flop reports shown below. I chose the following two preflop scenarios for our comparison. Firstly, a 3-bet pot contested by SB and BTN (so, the preflop aggressor = OOP). Secondly, a 3-bet pot with BTN vs CO (preflop aggressor = IP).
The OOP 3-bettor‚Äôs average checking frequency is considerably higher than an IP 3-bettor‚Äôs (33.9% vs 19.7% for all flops).
This is because we will always be at an informational and equity realization disadvantage across all streets. Our opponent will always have more information about our range because we must act first. Under those circumstances, we don‚Äôt want to very frequently build a pot.
OOP uses relatively bigger sizes, while IP is using relatively smaller ones.
The reason is simple: In position is able to call more hands compared to out of position versus the same size. IP can float more hands, realize more equity, and gain more information about the OOP‚Äôs range. When it‚Äôs the other way around (CO versus the IP BTN 3-bettor), in position uses smaller sizes because CO has a harder time realizing their equity and is forced to fold more compared to IP.
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs average c-bet flop strategy vs BTN: 100bb effective, NL500
The BTN 3-bettor‚Äôs average c-bet flop strategy vs CO: 100bb effective, NL500

Grouping Flop Textures
There are over 22,000 possible flops in Texas Hold ‚Äôem, 1755 of them are strategically distinct. Going through those 1755 flops one by one, for all different positions, isn‚Äôt very effective. For a smarter method, we created eight groups that represent all 1755 flops. When you become more experienced, you can build subgroups to get progressively more detailed. But this is more than enough to get started.
To better understand flop play for an OOP preflop 3-bettor, we will take a closer look at two different rainbow flops mentioned in the chart above, from the perspective of the SB 3-bettor versus BTN caller.
Playing Two Broadway Flops: KQ2r
Flops with multiple Broadway cards usually heavily favor the 3-bettor. Let‚Äôs see how things play out on KQ2r.
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs c-bet flop strategy vs BTN on KQ2r
When we take a look at the c-bet strategy of the SB 3-bettor on KQ2r, we notice two things straight away:
The 3-bettor has a very high c-betting frequency, 100% of their entire range in this case.
The OOP preflop 3-bettor mainly uses a smaller c-bet sizing.
But why is that? To understand the strategy, we will analyze this flop texture on a more detailed level with the help of the ‚ÄúRanges tab.‚Äù
Range comparison (equity buckets) on KQ2r
Let‚Äôs take a look at the equity buckets and the equity chart.
The Small Blind has a huge advantage in the buckets between 70‚Äì100%.
The Button has more hands between 0‚Äì70%, especially between 0‚Äì25%.
The equity chart is a perfect visualizer. It shows that the 3-bettor has a decent advantage across the entire range; SB‚Äôs strongest hands are stronger than BTN‚Äôs strongest hands, their medium hands are stronger than BTN‚Äôs medium hands, and their weakest hands are also stronger than BTN‚Äôs weakest hands.
Switching from equity buckets to hand buckets gives us an even more practical view.
The SB 3-bettor has more sets, overpairs, and way more top pairs.
The BTN caller has more third pairs and way more unmade hands.
Hand buckets on KQ2r (left = SB, right = BTN)
The ranges tab clearly shows how huge the SB preflop 3-bettor‚Äôs advantage is on this flop.
SB‚Äôs range is mainly built around strong high cards and medium-to-strong pocket pairs. BTN‚Äôs range is built more around smaller pocket pairs and medium-high cards
Most of the range benefits from getting thin value versus BTN‚Äôs range.
Our best hands don‚Äôt really need protection because there is not much equity to deny.
We can bluff very effectively for a small size because almost 22% of BTN‚Äôs hands have less than 25% equity.
These are all reasons for the 3-bettor to bet a lot of their hands for a small sizing.
Playing Low-Connected Flops: 654r
When the OOP preflop 3-bettor is presented with lower flops that are connected, they have to check a lot or even range-check, which is fascinating, right? Being the preflop aggressor who holds all of the biggest pairs while our opponent doesn‚Äôt, we still need to check most or even all our hands! To understand why, we are going to check out 654r.
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs c-bet flop strategy vs BTN on 654r
When we compare 654r with our previous example of KQ2r, we see a major shift from aggression to passivity. As always, the ranges tab provides great insight into some of the underlying reasons.
Range comparison (equity buckets) on 654r
Similar to the strategy, the equity buckets and the equity chart look totally different from our first example.
The SB has no clear advantage in the bottom and medium-range parts.
The BTN starts to stand out in the nutted area. IP has way more very high-equity hands, such as sets, two pairs, or straights.
To get a better visual understanding, it helps to recall how both ranges look like:
The SB 3-bettor mainly has high cards or overpairs. They don‚Äôt even have 55/44/65s/54s in this spot.
However, the BTN caller has way more middling and low cards that connect way better to a flop like this.
The 3-bettor has no advantage in the lower- or medium-equity buckets and is even a big underdog in the high-equity buckets. We also need to consider that there are so many good turn and river cards for the IP player, which will connect way better with their range.
For all of these reasons, the 3-bettor needs to be very careful and wants to check a lot of their hands.
How To Quickly Analyze Flops in Practice
Sometimes, you may feel a bit lost while playing a hand. This is normal and happens to everyone once in a while. We want to give you four questions you can ask yourself to be able to maneuver more successfully through spots when you are not sure what to do.
What do my and my opponent‚Äôs ranges look like?
How do they interact with the flop? Who does the board texture favor?
How is this influencing my overall range strategy?
What does my exact hand want to do, given all the context we collected with the first 3 questions?

Conclusion
Playing 3-bet pots OOP as the aggressor can be tough. Following the principles we learned today will give you a better idea of how to approach these types of spots:
As a simplification, don‚Äôt cold-call from the SB: Play a 3-bet or fold strategy.
When you 3-bet from the BB, you must also use some relatively weaker hands. They are usually to be found near the bottom of our calling range.
You need to be more conservative when out of position. You are always at an informational and equity realization disadvantage. You don‚Äôt want to build a pot as frequently as when you are IP, especially when we don‚Äôt have a clear advantage.
We want to use bigger sizes compared to an in position 3-bettor because the IP preflop caller can float more hands, realize more equity, and gain more knowledge about the OOP‚Äôs range.
Practice Makes Perfect
Like all things involving a lot of information, it will require a significant amount of practice to get comfortable with processing it all. This applies to everyone, though; no one is born a master.
To get cracking, we have built two drills that will help to improve quickly and better understand different textures.
This drill focuses on the spot we covered today: SB vs BTN.
And check this drill out if you‚Äôre curious about what the SB and BB are doing versus different positions.

### TOPIC: 4bet pot oop as preflop caller
4-Bet Pots OOP as the Preflop Caller
4-bet pots are often uncomfortable to play. Some of the reasons include:
 A lot of chips are already in the middle early on in the hand
Ranges are tighter than the more commonly occurring spots
Any postflop mistakes are more costly due to the preflop action
The most difficult configuration of this type of spot involves playing as the preflop caller from out of position (OOP), as your range will be weaker and you will lack the inherent advantage that position gives you.
To study these spots, we‚Äôll be using a 100bb SB vs BTN cash game example. Looking at the flop report, something intriguing immediately sticks out:
Manhattan plot of all 1755 Small Blind first in flop strategies

Ace-High Boards
While the vast majority of boards receive a range-check‚Äîas we might expect from the preflop caller‚Äîquite a few Ace-high and Queen-high boards have the SB donking for 20% pot, particularly where the other two cards are middling.
A98tt is the prime example of this phenomenon, where SB donks nearly all the time with most of its range.
SB donk-bet flop strategy vs BTN (preflop 4-bettor) on A98tt
The only exception on this board is King-x hands that don‚Äôt contain a flush draw, and the rest of the range checks a minor amount to compensate.
But why does this happen at all? Intuitively, leading into the preflop aggressor on an Ace-high board seems suicidal, especially in a 4-bet pot where they are more likely to hold an Ace compared to when they have a wider range.
The answer lies in the fact that the SB‚Äôs range has been quite condensed as well by the preflop action:
SB makes many top pairs on Ace-high boards (about as many as BTN does, though BTN holds the strongest Ace-x combinations).
And when the two lower cards are middling, they can also make sets and two pairs that BTN does not have.
Additionally, BTN‚Äôs range contains a decent amount of KK and QQ that dislike seeing an Ace-high flop, while the SB does not contain such underpairs as they would‚Äôve been shoved preflop.
Since SB does not have a significant disadvantage on top pair hands, and has flopped a significant nut advantage, leads play very well.

King-High Boards
These boards are where the most concessions are made to the IP player. The majority of King-high boards will give IP a massive range and nut advantage, as they will have top pair, top kicker and sets where we do not have any. For this reason, the solver recommends a range-check strategy for almost every single King-high board. Afterward, IP is allowed to play a range-bet strategy, splitting between 10% and 20% pot-sized bets depending on the texture.
As a trend, IP prefers 10% when the flop is monotone and/or disconnected, adjusting to both the equalizing factor of flushes in range, as well as the lack of easy continues for OOP on highly disconnected boards.
When facing these range-bets, OOP must still play aggressively despite the large disadvantage; Our example flop here is K84tt, where IP splits almost perfectly evenly between 10% and 20% in theory.
BTN c-bet flop strategy vs SB on K84tt
Against 10%, OOP defends around ‚Öî of the time, close to half of which is done by raising to a small, non-all-in size. These raises come largely from King-x combos, nut flush draws, and AQo combinations that contain a heart.
SB response vs BTN‚Äôs 10% pot c-bet
Investigating this response tells us something else about 4-bet pots; since ranges are so tight already, blocker effects are magnified much earlier than they‚Äôd usually become relevant. AQo without a heart is a pure fold, while AQo with a heart always continues. Additionally, AQo is used as a bluff as it has removal to BTN‚Äôs strongest top pair combinations.
To see an example of this, we can look at the same board but in an SRP and compare using the ‚ÄúBlockers‚Äù tab.
SB‚Äôs frequency adjustments when BTN holds certain cards: single-raised pot
SB‚Äôs frequency adjustments when BTN holds certain cards: 4-bet pot
We can see that in both scenarios, the cards that generate the most folds from the OOP player are very similar, with the A‚ô• being the most critical card for generating flop folds. However, in our 4-bet pot, the value of holding the A‚ô• has over doubled.
Practically, this means that having a concrete understanding of the ranges that arrive in 4-bet pots is critically important because it is very easy to drift from theory in ways that become very expensive over time.

Lower Boards
Since ranges in 4-bet pots are concentrated heavily around both players holding high cards and strong pairs, it‚Äôs hard to intuitively navigate boards that do not connect strongly with those ranges.
When viewing GTO strategies on these textures, the big takeaway is that both players‚Äô strategies begin to focus on how to exploit the unimproved high card region of the other‚Äôs range. For example, T98r boards see OOP donk-jam for 140% pot with half of their range! This is because OOP has a large concentration of top pair plus straight draw combinations that currently beat hands like AK and AQ, and donk-jamming these hands alongside a range of high card bluffs is the best way to maximally realize equity against these high card hands.
SB donk-bet flop strategy vs BTN on T98r
Facing this donk-jam, IP has to call off any pair, and still must dig deeper and call AKs combinations almost pure to reach the calling frequency to remain unexploitable facing SB‚Äôs surprising action.
BTN response vs SB‚Äôs donk-jam (140% pot)
When boards become even lower, both players begin to use this flop-jam strategy with some regularity, as draws become nearly nonexistent and the emphasis on how to realize equity with overpairs is heightened.

Conclusion
When playing in 4-bet pots, mastery begins by fully understanding the ranges that players reach the flop with. A typical feature will be how narrow the ranges are due to the explosive preflop action.
As a result of the above, blocker effects tend to magnify sooner, and we must already choose carefully on the flop which combination we use for certain actions.
Aggression is mandatory! Even in large pots against strong ranges, we must be able to find aggressive lines (including with bluffs) to profit.
### TOPIC: analyze turn textures
How To Analyze Turn Textures In Poker
In community card games like hold ‚Äòem, the face-up cards on the board are an important source of information about the hands you are likely to see at showdown. The board‚Äôs texture determines which pairs are likely and whether straights, flushes, or full houses will be possible. Each time a new card is revealed, you learn new information about these variables and how likely you are to hold the winning hand üèÖ
The flop reveals the most information of any street. We can categorize flops based on their high card, the number of suits they contain, whether they are paired, how many straights or straight draws they make possible, and more. These are all ways of describing how the board cards interact with each player‚Äôs range of likely hole cards.
When it comes to analyzing the new board card on the turn, the question we are most interested in is: What has changed?
Which new hands have become possible that were not possible on the flop? Even blank turn cards, those unlikely to interact with any player‚Äôs range significantly, convey important information. Hands that were already strong on the flop are stronger by virtue of fading some threats on the turn, while draws and unpaired hands are weaker with only one remaining opportunity to improve.

Range Advantage
Range advantage is a way of talking about how different players‚Äô ranges interact with one another. There are two main kinds of range advantage:
Equity advantage ‚Äì How is equity distributed between the ranges? Which player has the most, and how large is the difference between them? Equity advantage tends to correlate with betting frequency. The stronger a player‚Äôs range, the more incentive they have to bet.
Nuts advantage ‚Äì How likely is each player to have the strongest possible hands? Who is most likely to have them, and how large is the difference? Nuts advantage tends to correlate with bet size. The more likely a player is, relative to their opponents, to have nutty hands, the more incentive they have to grow the pot with large bets.
A player‚Äôs equity on the flop is the average of their equity on all possible turns. Once a specific turn card is revealed, their equity will increase or decrease based on how much that card helps them relative to their opponent, and their betting frequency will increase or decrease along with it.
Nuts advantage is more binary. One player has the nuts advantage after the flop action, and they will either retain or lose that advantage depending on what the turn brings. We tend to see big bets from this player on blank turns that do not significantly change the board texture by making new nutty hands possible and smaller bets (sometimes accompanied by more frequent betting from a player who has gained the nut advantage) on turns that change the board texture.

Prior Action
When analyzing turn texture, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind the pre-flop and flop action, which determines which player enjoyed the range advantage(s) prior to the turn.
A player who comes into the turn with a big advantage may retain that advantage even on a slightly unfavorable turn that makes some new nutty hands possible for their opponent.
Aggression correlates with nut advantage. A player who has been betting or raising is more likely to have nutty hands than one who has been checking and calling. When a player raises pre-flop, continuation bets the flop, and gets called, they will have the nuts advantage going into the turn. On the average turn card, they will bet big or check; texture changing cards are, by definition, exceptions.
The preflop aggressor should hold fewer nutted hands if they checked the flop. Depending on the magnitude of their nut advantage on the flop, they may maintain that advantage on the turn, but it will be diminished.

Example
We can see these principles in action in a simple example from an NL500 100BB cash game. UTG opens, BB calls, UTG bets 33% pot on a K‚ô† 8‚ô† 7‚ô• flop and BB calls again. At this point, before the turn card is revealed, UTG has the nuts advantage but not the equity advantage. BB had a lot of incentive to raise their best hands and to fold their worst ones, so their call indicates a relatively strong but condensed range, whereas UTG‚Äôs bet is more consistent with very strong and relatively weak hands.
Let‚Äôs remind ourselves what this will mean for UTG‚Äôs turn strategy:
On blank turns, we expect a modest amount of betting for a large size.
On turns that negate UTG‚Äôs nuts advantage, we expect smaller bets and perhaps a lower betting frequency (depending on how the turn changes the equity distribution).
On turns that maintain UTG‚Äôs nuts advantage and also improve their equity, we expect more frequent betting, often for a smaller size.
Now here‚Äôs the report summarizing UTG‚Äôs strategy on all possible turns, if BB checks to them:
UTG vs BB Strategy by turn card on K‚ô† 8‚ô† 7‚ô• after bet 33% call

A few patterns appear:
UTG consistently uses smaller bets on spade turns, which negate their nuts advantage by making many flushes possible for BB. The only exception is the 7s, which also pairs the board. UTG has more quads and full houses in their range and so can do some overbetting on this card.
Cards that complete straights function similarly, though the effect is less dramatic because BB will have fewer straight combos. Fives are the exception because BB would have folded 96o pre-flop and mostly raised 96s on the flop, making straights possible but quite unlikely for them on these turns.
UTG has the highest betting frequency on non-spade A, K, and Q turns. These cards do not make straights or flushes possible and improve UTG‚Äôs equity more than BB‚Äôs, as UTG is more likely to hold unpaired Broadway cards after the flop action. This correlates with a smaller bet size, especially when an A turns. These cards help UTG‚Äôs equity so much they actually run out of good bluffing candidates to support an overbetting range, and they are incentivized to use a smaller size in order to make thinner value bets with their many Ax and Kx hands.
The blankest turns are non-spade wheel cards, which neither complete draws nor improve the unpaired hands in UTG‚Äôs range. On these cards, UTG mostly checks or overbets.
The lower board pairs, 7 and 8, are not nearly as good as K for UTG as BB is more likely to turn trips. Consequently, UTG rarely bets these turns, though as with the 7‚ô†, their full house and quads advantage still facilitates a small overbetting range.
BB almost exclusively checks the turn after check-calling the flop. The only exceptions are the cards we‚Äôve already identified as introducing significant new nut hands into BB‚Äôs previously capped range:
BB‚Äôs strategy by turn card after check-calling 33% UTG bet on K‚ô† 8‚ô† 7‚ô•
BB has some incentive to bet these cards precisely because they are bad for UTG, who can not be expected to bet as often when checked to.
We have been using Aggregate reports a lot in this article. Here is a guide on how to use them.

When the Flop Checks Through
Now think about what happens when UTG checks the flop, which they do with about 25% of their range. It‚Äôs important to note that while UTG‚Äôs checking range is somewhat weaker than their betting range, it is not at all weak. In fact, UTG is incentivized to bet many of their weakest hands on the flop, leaving their checking range rather condensed. Their checking range is concentrated around pairs:
UTG flop strategy by made hand category, filtered for checking range
UTG‚Äôs pre-flop range is much stronger than BB‚Äôs, so despite a slight weakening effect, they retain both the equity advantage and some degree of nut advantage after checking. That means that in general, we should expect a low betting frequency from BB on the turn and mostly small bet sizes.
Here‚Äôs the report after the flop checks through, this time showing the strategy from BB‚Äôs perspective:
BB Probe strategy by turn card on K‚ô† 8‚ô† 7‚ô•
There is indeed a low frequency of betting. The best cards for BB to bet are, once again, those that change the board texture. In fact, these cards are even better for BB after UTG checks behind the flop! This is because action on the flop concentrates ranges around cards that coordinate with the board. UTG had a lot of incentive to bet their flush and straight draws on the flop, so they are less likely to make flushes and straights when those cards turn.
Action on the flop concentrates ranges around cards that coordinate with the board
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the draws in UTG‚Äôs flop checking range:
UTG flop strategy by draw hand category, filtered for checking range
Declining to bet the flop is an indication that UTG is unlikely to hold a draw. BB‚Äôs flop check does not convey this same information, as they check their entire range. Thus, when a draw completes after the flop checks through, BB acquires a nut advantage and can do some overbetting. This is true even though UTG checks some draws on the flop‚Äìthey do not check enough to make overbetting undesirable on these turns.
If BB checks a second time, we see mostly small bets from UTG, a consequence of their less nutty range. The main exceptions are the Broadway cards that most improve them, introducing some new nutty hands into their previously capped range.

Conclusion
Range disparities are most pronounced in UTG vs BB confrontations, and this is an especially good flop for UTG. These patterns are not always as clear and pronounced as they appear here, but the underlying principles should inform your evaluation of the turn card in any situation. Start with a clear understanding of how the equities and nutty hands are distributed prior to the turn card, then consider how much the turn changes those distributions.
### TOPIC: blockers and unblockers
Blockers & Unblockers: The Secret to Picking Great Bluffs
Blocker/unblocker was a concept my coach, Dara O‚ÄôKearney, showed me in relation to bluffs. It is one of those things that you cannot unsee once you have been shown it. It applies to pre- and postflop, and it really helps you identify good bluffs when you‚Äôre in the midst of a hand.
A good bluff should simultaneously block very strong hands and unblock the hands that we want to fold out. Blocker/unblocker is a useful heuristic for picking powerful bluffs. It is particularly pertinent preflop and on the river.

Preflop
Let‚Äôs jump right into a hand example to see what blocker/unblocker is.
Cash Game Hand Example
This is the NL500 opening range for UTG:
UTG(6) opening strategy: 100bb, NL500
In response to the open, this is what the HJ strategy looks like at equilibrium:
HJ response vs UTG(6) open
It‚Äôs a pure raising range, of which about half the hands UTG opened.
Which ones of these hands would you consider to be bluffs?
We can answer that by looking at the UTG response to the HJ 3-bet:
UTG(6) response vs HJ 3-bet
A5s‚ÄìA3s are clearly bluffs; they can make better hands fold like A9s‚ÄìA6s and some small pocket pairs. KQo is also a bluff; similarly, it can get folds from some Ace-x and small pairs. However, these hands also make worse hands fold, but we are happy enough to take down the pot this way (especially to avoid paying rake postflop).
These might seem like quite strong hands to turn into bluffs. One of the reasons they are so effective is that:
They simultaneously block and unblock the right hands.
A5s, for example, blocks the really strong hands like AA and AK. It also unblocks a lot of weaker (but still threatening) hands that fold like K9s‚ÄìK5s, QTs‚ÄìQ8s, and so on. So, just to be crystal clear, the Ace is a blocker, and the 5 is an unblocker.

Tournament Hand Example
Let‚Äôs look at a spot where preflop action is more significant, and taking the pot down then and there is very valuable, i.e., in tournaments. These are 20bb symmetrical stacks near the bubble. This is the CO opening range:
CO opening strategy: 20bb (symmetric), near bubble
This is how the BTN responds:
BTN response vs CO open
A lot of folding, not much calling, and an almost 50/50 mix of shoving and raising to 5bb (with slightly more shoving).
This is the CO response to the 5bb raise:
CO response vs BTN non-all-in (5bb) raise
This is the CO response to the all-in (20bb) raise:
CO response vs BTN all-in (20bb) raise
Looking at the folds, we can tell the primary bluffs are, once again, low suited Ace-x. They block the stronger Ace-x continues, while also unblocking all the suited Broadway hands that fold. There are some suited Broadway bluff-shoves like KQs‚ÄìKTs. They block many of the calling hands, such as KK, QQ, AK, AQ, JJ, and TT, but also unblock folding hands like the small pocket pairs, as well as Ace-x. We also see a small amount of bluff-raising with hands like K3s, which block KK/AK calls and unblock a lot of the suited Q-x and J-x hands that fold.
Notice that we do not see bluffs with hands like J3s. And it so happens to be that they mostly go against the blocker/unblocker heuristic:
By not blocking enough (only JJ in this spot) of the strong calling hands
And not unblocking enough of the sort of hands that we‚Äôd like to get folds from
There is another reason why we mostly pick suited hands like A5s and K3s for our bluffs. They block strong hands, they unblock folds, and crucially, they can make very strong hands when called. A hand like A5s or K3s is in bad shape when it is called by AA, KK, or AK, but it still has a little bit of extra chance of outdrawing via a flush by the river. The low cards in the bluffs are also at least ‚Äòlive‚Äô in the sense that they have some outdraw possibilities by making a low straight or trips, which the AA and KK-type hands cannot.
This is why A5‚ÄìA2s make particularly strong bluffs. They block continues, they unblock ‚Äòdiscontinues,‚Äô they make (nut) flushes, and they make (wheel) straights.

Postflop
Let‚Äôs look at this concept in a postflop scenario. This hand is on the river of an NL500 cash game. UTG has opened, and the BB has called.
The flop is A‚ô†9‚ô†6‚ô•.
The flop has gone check, bet 33% pot, call.
The turn is a 5‚ô•.
It goes check, bet 75% pot, call.
The river is a 2‚ô¶.
These are the ranges for both players on the river with their equities:
River ranges on A‚ô†9‚ô†6‚ô• 5‚ô• 2‚ô¶ (view: equity)
UTG has all the nutted (90%+ equity) hands, but the BB has a lot of strong (70‚Äì90% EQ) hands they will want to get value with by betting them, which means they will also need some bluffs.
With that in mind, this is the BB‚Äôs first action on the river:
BB first-in river strategy
Mostly checks, but ~5% of the time, the BB leads. They have straights, two pairs, and top pairs that all want to extract value and do not want UTG to check back.
That means they also need some bluffs. Given that ~48% of hands in the range are under 50% equity and 14% of the range is considered ‚Äòtrash,‚Äô the BB has plenty of options for the bluffs.
Looking at the flop, my initial instinct regarding bluffs would be to prefer 8-x and 7-x because they block straights. I‚Äôd be avoiding bluffing spade or heart draws that missed, because I know that missed flush draws often make bad bluffs because they block other missed flush draws that would make up a big part of the folding range. I‚Äôd probably pick K8s, even though the only available combo is spades, because it blocks straights, AK, KK, and K9.
However, the actual commonly used bluff hands here are all suited misses! 8‚ô†4‚ô† and 7‚ô†3‚ô† are pure bluffs. 7‚ô†4‚ô†, J‚ô†8‚ô†, T‚ô•8‚ô• and T‚ô•7‚ô• are frequent bluffs.
The fact that they have the suits from the missed flush draws is probably because there were two flush draws by the turn, and any hand with diamonds or clubs will have gotten out of the way already. So, the heuristic of missed flush draws being bad bluffs is not disproven, but here, we don‚Äôt have many alternatives to choose from.
Every hand has an 8 or 7, which obviously blocks the straight. Let‚Äôs look at the response to the 35% pot river donk-bet to learn more about the unblocker properties of our bluffs:
UTG response vs BB‚Äôs 35% pot river donk-bet
UTG folds ~30% of the time. The hands that fold are predominantly Broadway hands that had a flush draw as well! Hands like K‚ô†Q‚ô†, K‚ô†J‚ô†, K‚ô•J‚ô•, K‚ô†T‚ô†, K‚ô•T‚ô•, K‚ô†8‚ô†, K‚ô†7‚ô†, Q‚ô†J‚ô†, Q‚ô†T‚ô†, Q‚ô•T‚ô•, JTs and some offsuit hands like KQo, KJo, KTo, QTo etc. There are other hands that fold, but most of the folds are unpaired hands with a King or Queen in them.
All of our primary bluffs unblock those hands. A hand like 8‚ô†4‚ô† blocks the nut straight and also unblocks all of those Broadway folds. This is not a high-adrenaline bluff that would make a TV highlight reel by getting a monster to fold; it‚Äôs merely targeting all the trash in the range. Hands that would all check back if it was checked to them.
Looking back on what my instincts were, K8s would be a terrible bluff because it blocks half of the hands that would have folded.
We are going to look at two different postflop features of GTO Wizard that may show us the blocker/unblocker value of hands. The first one is the value and trash removal scores in the ‚ÄúSummary‚Äù tab. When we bluff, we want to remove value, but not trash.
These are the scores for some of our bluffs:
Removal scores of BB‚Äôs (river donk) bluffs
Let‚Äôs compare that to K8s, which I thought would make for a good bluff before studying this spot:
It‚Äôs true that K8s removes more value, but it also removes much more trash, which we do not want because trash (better than our own trash) is all we can get to fold. So, in this hand example, our bluffs are primarily being selected based on their unblocking properties.
Going back to the UTG response to the lead, they raise the BB‚Äôs lead 30% of the time, mostly by going all-in. The value is mostly sets and two pairs, but what about the bluffs?
The most common bluff is 9-x: K9s, Q9s, J9s, and 89s all turn their second pair into a bluff. The other common bluffs are the small pocket pairs (44 and 33). Finally, K5s when it is not spades bluffs.
Let‚Äôs look at the BB‚Äôs response to the UTG river raise shove to see why these hands are picked to jam:
BB response vs UTG‚Äôs 266% pot river raise all-in
Most of the two pairs that call feature a 9, and a set of nines is in the opponent‚Äôs range, so the 9 blocks a lot of value. 89s is the master blocker in this respect, as not only does it block two pairs and sets, it also blocks the straight.
The BB did not bluff at the start of the river action with a K/Q/J because these cards were in the hands that UTG would‚Äôve folded, so the BB picked hands like 84s, which unblocked those folds. This is precisely why these same high cards are in the UTG bluffing range; they were never in BB‚Äôs bluffing hands. So, these cards unblock BB‚Äôs bluffs.
What is a bad unblocker for one player is (often) a good unblocker for their opponent.
The other hand class that bluffs is the small pairs (44 and 33). They have the obvious blocker value of blocking the wheel straight. They also unblock the J8s‚ÄìJ7s, T8s‚ÄìT7s hands that all bluffed. K5s also belongs to this category. Low pairs turned into bluffs are pretty similar. The difference is that they block another sort of value; instead of straights, they block some two pair combos that call. The similarity is that they also unblock the same bluffs as 44 and 33 do.
Another useful tool in GTO Wizard is the ‚ÄúBlockers‚Äù tab, which shows you whether a particular card in one player‚Äôs range increases or decreases the other player‚Äôs frequencies of folding/calling/raising. For example, this is the node when BB is facing an all-in. If UTG has the cards below, the feature shows the likelihood the BB will call or fold:
Cards sorted in UTG‚Äôs range based on the increase of BB‚Äôs folds
The 3‚ô† is the most powerful blocker, which is found sometimes in UTG‚Äôs bluffing range with 33, as it simultaneously blocks straights and unblocks the hands that fold. (The only fold with a 3 in it is 73s, which is a tiny part of the opponent‚Äôs range). It increases the chances of folding by 2.78%. As you can see, 6-x and 9-x also increase the folding frequency significantly, and UTG‚Äôs bluff range had a lot of 9-x in it.
Similarly, this tab can also reveal the cards with the worst blocker value for your objective:
Cards sorted in UTG‚Äôs range based on the decrease of BB‚Äôs folds
2‚ô† is the worst card to bluff with, as it unblocks all the strong two pair combos that call, as well as blocking the only two pair combos that fold. Having this card in your hand increases the chances of being called by 5.93% at equilibrium.
Throughout this article, my instinct was that K‚ô†8‚ô† would be a good bluff both as a lead and as a reraise. However, just like the value/trash removal feature showed me earlier, it looks like a terrible bluff. This time we can see that both those cards increase our chances of being called by a combined 0.5%.

Conclusion
I picked preflop and river examples to cover this heuristic because, in my experience, that is when the blocker/unblocker effect is most pronounced. On the flop and turn, improvability is perhaps a more significant factor when picking bluffs.
Before the flop, there is no board yet to determine which hands have improvability.
On the river, there are no more cards to come, so no more ways to improve.
We saw that blocker/unblocker is a heuristic for picking bluffs. With two cards in your hand, it is possible to find bluffs where one of your cards blocks value and the other one unblocks folds. But this heuristic can guide us in the process of value-betting as well. A good hand to value-bet will unblock worse hands that you want to get called by while also blocking better hands that you do not want to get called by.
### TOPIC: bluffing with a pair
Should You Ever Bluff with a Pair?
Turning a made hand into a bluff might initially sound counterintuitive. In the pre-solver days, holding a weak pair was often associated with checking, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to bloat the pot and are happy to reach a cheap showdown‚Äù was a common saying. Solvers helped us understand that betting weak pairs outperforms checking in some situations. The line between randomly betting pairs and precisely knowing what you are doing can be blurry. But fear not! In this article, you will learn everything you need to successfully grasp the concepts of bluffing pairs in cash games to outplay your opponents.

The Logic Behind Turning Pairs ‚Üí Bluffs
Before diving into the practical examples, we need to know a few theoretical things.
When we look at solver outputs on the river, we frequently see that we are not just bluffing our air but are also supposed to use some of our pairs. The solver calculates:
The EV of pure bluffing: EV (Bluff) = (Fold% √ó (Pot)) ‚Äì (Defend% √ó (Bet))
The EV of checking as the IP player: (EQ of hand) √ó (Pot)
(OOP is slightly more complicated because we are not closing the action.)
The calculated EV helps us to understand how all of the possible actions perform on the river.
On earlier streets, however, multiple merged motives can sometimes encourage us to take the aggressive line with some of our weak pairs.
To clarify, a solver does not ‚Äúthink‚Äù as a human would; it‚Äôs an EV-maximizing algorithm that calculates the best strategies given the inputs that were provided. By comparing solver outputs, we can recognize repeating patterns for which we can build heur√≠stics that make all of this output easier to understand and more practical to use in-game.

The Dos and Don‚Äôts
Turning pairs into a bluff can be tricky. Often, minor differences draw the line between an excellent play and a spew. But there is good news! This is not just solver noise. Every strange-looking play is made for a reason. The more we understand how ranges interact with board textures and potential runouts, the easier it becomes. To uncover the different motives for sometimes taking the aggressive route with our weak pairs and acquire the ability to spot the difference between randomly clicking buttons and thoughtful plays, we will inspect some realistic examples to better grasp when and why to turn pairs into bluffs.
Bluffing Pairs in Single-Raised Pots
We usually want to keep the pot small with marginal holdings, especially when we are out of position (OOP). There are situations, though, where we want to check/raise some of our weak pairs. To give you a better insight, let us explore the following spot:
BB response (filtered for suited 4-x) vs BTN‚Äôs 33% pot c-bet on K84r: NL500, 100bb starting
As we can see, our bottom pairs, especially the ones with the lowest kickers, get checked/raised around 20% of the time here. But why is that? Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the BTN response to find out:
BTN response vs BB‚Äôs 100% pot check/raise
There are a couple of prominent indicators to be identified in the BTN‚Äôs response:
The BTN is starting to fold better pairs, such as 55‚Äì77, some 8-x, and even a tiny percentage of their weakest top pairs. IP is folding a massive number of two live overcards to the four, which results in an immense amount of EQ denial. At the same time, the BTN is floating with their best backdoor hands. So, the effect is of a merged nature; we get some better hands to fold and a few worse hands to call (or fold).
The BB blocks a decent amount of IP‚Äôs best hands when holding a four while having five outs to outdraw their higher pairs.
IP is folding a lot of Ten-x, Jack-x, and Queen-x, so OOP prefers to check/raise 4-x that unblock those hands by not holding one of these three cards. Hands like Q4 block more of IP‚Äôs folding range than hands like 43. Another motive is the risk of coolers for OOP increases when holding Q4 instead of 43. IP has significantly more KQ and QQ combos they continue with compared to 33 and K3 because IP doesn‚Äôt have any K3o in his range and folds all 33 combos versus the check/raise.
In this situation, one exception is low pairs with an overcard to the top pair, A4. A4 benefits from check/raising since it can outdraw current nutted two pairs and cooler Ace-x when an Ace turns up.
Getting a clearer picture of how to play the flop is already great, but future streets are often still shrouded in a fog of war. Countless different runouts can make it feel complicated to locate the signal of when and why to keep betting our weak pairs. Let us examine how and how not to keep betting our weakest pairs on future runouts together.

When To Keep Bluffing With Pairs
We take a turn onto a bricky 2. The sim tells us to keep the pressure on with almost 80% of BB‚Äôs 4-x. Some motives are pretty similar to the flop, but a few differ.
The first two reasons overlap with the ones on the flop: The BTN folds many better pairs:
All pocket pairs below the King fold purely.
The vast majority of second pairs (68.4%), and even a considerable number of top pairs (34.9%). (BB also denies a significant amount of EQ from all BTN‚Äôs flop floats that are now pure folding on the turn.)
The noticeable difference is that the BB is running out of bluffs. All the BDSD and BDFD combos between the 8 and the King are giving up pure because of poor blocker properties and no chance to improve to even outdraw a top pair King. The BB‚Äôs 4-x combos are getting forced into becoming bluffs. The fact that the BTN doesn‚Äôt continue with worse hands, except for a minimal amount of gutshots around the low end of the board, is also an indication that they‚Äôre now considered bluffs. Third pair (4-x) is now betting for less merged motives; they become almost pure polar bluffs.
The river doesn‚Äôt change much on almost all runouts, except for the worst ones (King and 8); the BB is turning a substantial amount of 4-x into bluffs.
BB first-in river strategy (filter: 4-x) vs BTN on K842r 2 (after flop = X-B33-R100-C, turn = B125-C)
While the BB‚Äôs reasons for check/raising some of their small pairs started out merged on the flop, the motives cleared up as the hand progressed through the streets to the river. Blocking a substantial amount of BTN¬¥s strong hands and running out of natural bluffs while at the bottom of their range are the leading drivers for the BB to complete the conversion of 4-x into a bluff on the river in this spot.

When To Stop Bluffing With Pairs
In some scenarios, we don‚Äôt want to follow through with our weak pairs. To gain a more detailed understanding, let‚Äôs explore the following spot.
BB first-in river strategy (filter: 4-x) vs BTN on K8422 double FD brick (after flop = X-B33-R100-C, turn = B125-C)
Did you notice a difference regarding the board texture from the prior spot? At first, it seems there is only a small one, right? The suits changed, but that¬¥s about it. The strategy for OOP‚Äôs 4-x massively differs, though.
All of BB‚Äôs 4-x is now pure checking the river. Let us find out why!
We see something worth noticing if we examine the EQ of BB‚Äôs 4-x on the river. They have roughly twice the amount of EQ compared to the spot before. The reason is pretty simple: The BTN has lots of bricked flush draws. So, the BB can beat some of villain‚Äôs range at showdown with all their 4-x. OOP collects enough EV (i.e., showdown value) to make check the max EV action.
The BTN has a lot of bricked flush draws, but so does the BB, right? In the spot prior, the BB was running out of natural bluffs and was at the bottom of range when holding a single pair of fours. The BB can now choose bluffs from all their bricked flush draws they check/raised and barreled turn with.
To summarize the key learning so far:
There are sometimes merged motives for betting low pairs on the flop and turn, despite having enough showdown value and other bluffs to choose from.
The main merged motives for low pairs are:
Folding out better hands (pairs).
Denying EQ while getting called by worse hands (draws).
Those merge-bets with low pairs happen even more frequently when in position because the IP player can realize more EQ by always being able to check back the river on runouts where they don‚Äôt need to turn their weak pairs into a bluff.
As we can see, minor differences in board texture can cause major differences in strategy. Keeping an eye on how ranges look across all streets will help you maneuver through these spots more efficiently.

Bluffing Pairs in 3-Bet Pots
Turning pairs into a bluff is not just happening in SRPs. Let us explore the following two spots together to help you understand when and when not to bluff pairs in 3-bet pots!
When To Bluff With Pairs
BTN river strategy vs CO on AK48T (with flop = X-B33-C, turn = X-B75-C): NL500, 100bb starting)
When we examine the river output more closely, we will instantly notice that the BTN is bluffing with a decent amount of third and worse pairs (roughly 62%). There are a few reasons:
BTN‚Äôs lowest pairs have almost no showdown value.
Hands such as JT and QT have good removal effects since they don‚Äôt block any snap-folds and also block rivered two pairs the CO is pure calling the river with. Even though they win more at showdown compared to the lowest pocket pairs, it‚Äôs only by a marginal amount‚Äîthey only have 5‚Äì7% EQ themselves.
IP is running out of natural bluffs. Hands such as QJ/QT and JT that were gutshots on the turn rivered a straight or a pair. There are only very few busted draws in the BTN‚Äôs range. In particular, the lowest pairs with pure unblocker properties are now forced to turn themselves into a bluff. When we modify the river to a brick (that doesn‚Äôt change the nuts) like a deuce, we see that most of the BTN‚Äôs low pairs are checking back.
Ranges become very tight on the river. Blocker effects matter way more now. Having removal of a couple of strong hands in villain‚Äôs range already or blocking some of the snap-folds already has an enormous impact on their calling/folding ranges. A hand such as Q‚ô¶9‚ô¶ gives up pure while QT is bluffing pure, even though Q9 has less showdown value (roughly 5% less EQ). Q9 in diamonds blocks several snap-folds while JT has removal to a bunch of strong hands.
Notice that the same reasons to bluff low pairs return:
The low pairs are weak, they have low showdown value.
Favorable blocker effects.
The player runs out of natural bluffs.
Before we explore when not to bluff pairs in 3-bet pots, let‚Äôs test our understanding of ranges and how this impacts our strategy!
The EV of all given options to the BTN for JTs on the river
Question: J‚ô†T‚ô† makes more money than J‚ô•T‚ô• and even more than double the amount of J‚ô¶T‚ô¶ for the shoving option. Why is that?
Reveal Answer
You can use this knowledge to your advantage. In spots where you suspect that your opponent will call slightly lighter than he is supposed to, we can simplify and purely give up with our worst-performing pairs that are indifferent at equilibrium.
When you struggle with finding the motives why a particular combo gets chosen over another for a particular action, a closer look at the following two things will help you.
Exploring the trash and value removal scores at the top left of each combo.
Examine your opponent‚Äôs response versus your strategy.

When Not To Bluff With Pairs
BTN river strategy vs CO on JT523 (with flop = X-B33-C, turn = X-B75-C): NL500, 100bb starting)
When we compare the previous spot with this one, we will spot a big difference regarding the bluffing combos: The BTN is not bluffing with a single pair on the river, but why?
Even the worst pairs, such as A3s have almost 16% EQ, way more than the worst pairs in the spot before. The CO has a lot of bricked draws in range, enough that even the worst pairs in CO‚Äôs range win more than 15% of the time.
The BTN is not running out of natural bluffs. IP has plenty of combos with acceptable or good blocker properties, such as all busted straight draws and Ace-highs, except those with spades. All of them have much worse showdown value compared to the low pairs.
In spots where a player has lots of natural bluffs with good blocker properties and very little showdown value to choose from on the river, they often won‚Äôt need to turn weak pairs into a bluff.
The Influence of Position
Positions play a prominent role in how you construct your strategy. Let‚Äôs jump into the following spot to understand more deeply what influence positions have on bluffing pairs.
‚Üë BTN river strategy (filter: low pair) vs BB on JT36A flush-completing in an SRP (with flop = X-B50-C, turn = X-X)
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Üì UTG river strategy (filter: low pair) vs BB (same board (runout) and action)
Both spots are very similar, with the same flop sizing and turn check, on the same board. The only visible difference is the position. The IP player in the left picture opened from UTG, and the IP player on the right opened from the BTN. When we note the worst pairs of the IP player, we notice that the BTN checks them 100% of the time, while the UTG player turns them into a bluff almost 40% of the time. There are the following reasons:
The BB‚Äôs postflop defense is much wider versus the BTN compared to the one versus UTG. This means the lowest pairs of the BTN have way more EQ and showdown value compared to UTG. Looking at the EQ of the weakest pairs in both outputs confirms that. All pocket 99 and lower pairs of UTG have 0% EQ, while those same hands of BTN retain between 8‚Äì25% EQ.
The postflop defending ranges differ greatly depending on the position, but so do the preflop opening ranges. While the UTG player lacks a lot of natural bluffs in his range, such as all the seven to King-high combos, the BTN has far more natural bluffs to choose from.
As we can see, position is a very influential factor in the process of answering the questions of when and why to bluff pairs. In the end, though, it all comes down to how well you understand the composition of ranges and their interaction with board textures. Constantly improving this skill will help you to outperform and outplay your opponents in the long run.
When We Want to Deviate
Against weaker opponents who deviate themselves (often unintentionally), we want to adjust our strategy as well‚Äîfrom the default, GTO game plan to a custom-tailored, exploitative one. To illustrate how to adapt when it comes to turning pairs into bluffs, let us do a little experiment and take the previous BB vs BTN spot on JT36A flush-completing river but with a little twist.
In theory, the BB can only fold slightly over 50% of their third and worse pairs against a 67% pot river-bet in this spot.
Now, let us imagine we play at our local casino and face a tighter player who folds all their third pairs and worse on the river. How do we want to adjust?
‚Üë BTN GTO river strategy (filter: low pair) vs BB on JT36A flush-completing river in an SRP (with flop = X-B50-C, turn = X-X): equilibrium
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚Üì BTN exploitative river strategy (filter: low pair) vs BB (same board (runout), same action): nodelocked BB response (folding 100% of all third pairs and worse)
When we look at our default (GTO) strategy, we see that all low pairs always check on the river. They have enough showdown value, and the BTN has so much air to choose from that we don‚Äôt even consider bluffing them. They are ‚Äútoo high up in our range.‚Äù
Even though the above reasons also apply, when we examine the nodelocked (exploitative) solution, we notice a massive difference. The BTN is turning 100% of their low pairs into bluffs. Comparing the EV of BTN‚Äôs low pairs shows us how drastic the impact of BB‚Äôs heavy over-folding is:
The EV of all given options to the BTN for 55 on the river: GTO (‚Üñ), Exploitative (‚Üó)
Depending on the combo, the EV of bluffing for all low pairs increases between 250 and even over 400%. An outcome like this is not even unrealistic when we face a very tight player. As we can see, turning pairs into a bluff that would usually always take a showdown can be highly profitable. Keeping an eye on the player type you are facing, understanding what you and your opponent are supposed to do, and being able to adjust accordingly will skyrocket your win rate.

Conclusion
Uff, this was a lot of information to process! Let us go over the most critical points again.
While the motive for betting low pairs on the river is primarily driven by folding out better ones, betting low pairs on earlier streets often involves merged motives. The main reasons are to fold out better made hands and deny EQ while getting called by worse hands (typically draws). Merged betting with low pairs happens more often when we are IP due to higher EQR.
In river spots where we have many natural bluffs with good blocker properties and very little showdown value to choose from, turning our low pairs into a bluff is often overkill.
Don‚Äôt gloss over seemingly small differences in board texture. They can significantly impact optimal strategies.
When you are not sure why a particular combo gets chosen over another, inspect the trash and value removal scores at the top-left of each hand combination and how your opponent will respond versus your strategy. It will help you to maneuver through the hands more confidently.
Understanding the composition of ranges and their interaction with board textures is the key to outplaying your opponents in the long run.
Adapting to the mistakes of our opposing players will make the difference between being a slight or massive winner.

### TOPIC: building exploits
Building Exploits From Showdown
Understanding how and when to exploit opponents at a live poker table is a delicate affair. It‚Äôs easy to get carried away based on appearance. For example, silver-haired Mister ‚ÄòOld Man Coffee‚Äô is unlikely to be bluffing after 3-betting preflop and triple-barreling all-in on an AK-high board. Similarly, we may think that ‚ÄòYoung Punk With Hoodie And Sunglasses‚Äô may need to be called down a little lighter after check-raising the turn and shoving the river.
These are often just guesses based on certain perception biases that are unique to each individual. When we evaluate spots like these, we often think back to previous situations where we faced similar player types when we had a tough decision.
Without any other information, this can be a solid start. However, there‚Äôs one bit of information that should take priority over all else once we gain access to it, and that‚Äôs the hands we see at showdown.
Not Always a Game of Mixed Frequencies
In a GTO environment, there is often a great deal of mixing on both the flop and turn. We won‚Äôt always be able to look at a hand revealed at showdown and conclude that our opponent made a mistake.
Instead, what we want to do is start looking for hands that should never be in a player‚Äôs range. This can clue us in on their strategic approach, allowing us to search in a more directed way for the corresponding exploits that we should integrate in our strategy. Let‚Äôs move on to our first example to see this idea in action.

Example 1: Mr. ‚ÄòI Won‚Äôt Show Weakness‚Äô
In a 200bb 6-handed cash game at the local casino, we open the CO for 2.5bb with K‚ô†J‚ô†, and our opponent who just sat down makes a 3-bet to 11bb from the SB. With our hand, we‚Äôre happy to just call and evaluate postflop with the positional advantage.
The flop is K‚ô¶7‚ô•2‚ô•, giving us top pair with no redraws. Our opponent quickly makes a c-bet for 7.6bb, about ‚Öì the size of the pot. While we could raise with KJ occasionally, we feel like we should mostly just call and be a bit more cautious against an unknown player. So we call and go to the turn.
The turn brings the A‚ô¶, bringing a plethora of possible draws. Our opponent continues the aggression, betting ‚Öì pot once again (about 13bb into a 38bb pot). We‚Äôre not thrilled seeing an overcard that pairs up a portion of villain‚Äôs flop c-bet range. However, this seems like too good a price to fold. Our opponent still could have a lot of straight or flush draws and be representing the Ace, so we go ahead and call once again. To the river, we go.
A rivered 6‚ô£ bricks all possible draws. Our opponent checks, and we decide that it‚Äôs most prudent to check behind with our second pair. Expecting to see perhaps a weak Ace or some sort of busted draw that gave up, we‚Äôre pleasantly surprised when our opponent turns over JJ. We quickly show our KJ and claim the pot.
Summary postflop action
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to show weakness and face a big bet,‚Äù you hear him whisper to his friend standing behind him. His friend nods, and you nod too.
Most players will look past this pot since they didn‚Äôt really have a tough decision to make with their hand. However, a crucial piece of information that was disclosed at showdown should alter our strategy against this player in future jousts.
Hunting High and Low‚Ä¶ for Exploits
Our opponent made a standard preflop 3-bet with his premium holding.
On this K72tt flop, our opponent is allowed to make a bet with his entire range. Most King-high flops are very good for the preflop 3-bettor. However, there are some flops where the aggressor needs to be a bit more cautious, such as monotone flops and connected straight boards like KT9, where the 3-bettor has to do more checking.
SB‚Äôs aggregate flop strategy on King-high boards grouped by Suits
SB‚Äôs aggregate flop strategy on King-high boards grouped by Connectedness
So, betting JJ on K72 is not out of the ordinary. What about the turn?
While the turned Ace is one of the best cards for SB‚Äôs range overall, it‚Äôs not a situation where they should continue betting their entire range. Their Ace-high bluffs on the flop can certainly continue betting for value now, but we need to consider the big picture of what happens when SB bets again on the turn.
CO is likely going to only continue against SB‚Äôs turn bet with a ‚Äòbluff catcher‚Äô range comprising King-x and Ace-x as well as some high-equity draws. Since SB only bet ‚Öì pot on the flop, it‚Äôs perfectly reasonable for the CO to have some Ace-high backdoor floats that turned top pair as well. The SB should expect CO to fold almost all their pocket pairs.
SB‚Äôs value hands want to continue betting for value against one pair hands in CO‚Äôs range that will call. These include most Ace-x and King-x with the best kickers like KQ and KJ. SB also wants to get folds from hands like pocket pairs. Hands like QJ make a great bluff since they‚Äôre currently losing to a hand like 88, but SB will be able to get folds from those hands if they continue the aggression.
Does it make sense to bet a hand like JJ or even QQ in this scenario? The analysis we just made for SB does not contain any reasons to bet these hands. They would fold out hands they dominate and mostly get called by hands they only have 2 outs against. The solver seems to agree; suggesting that JJ is a pure check‚Äîmeaning betting is a clear deviation from GTO standards.
SB turn strategy on K‚ô¶7‚ô•2‚ô• A‚ô¶
In solver terms, betting all combos of JJ on the turn loses SB an average of 1bb of EV. In a 5/10 game, that‚Äôs the equivalent of giving $10 to our opponent.
The burning question is: how can we modify our strategy to maximize EV against this opponent based on what we retroactively learned about their (turn) strategy at showdown?
Since we‚Äôre already continuing with all our King-x and folding worse pocket pairs, we‚Äôre already doing well for ourselves by simply not folding second pairs. However, I would suggest that we can do better by bluff raising more often. Against an opponent who bets too many medium-equity hands out of position on the turn, raising will yield higher EV for bluffing hands, assuming they fold those medium-equity holdings. Since their range is weaker than what GTO recommends, we should logically expect more folds.
Against an OOP opponent who bets too many medium-equity hands on the turn,
raising will yield higher EV for bluffs (if those medium-equity hands fold).
In this example, a hand like 8‚ô£7‚ô£ is used as a turn raise by CO slightly less than half the time. We could start by increasing the frequency of our raises with this hand class.
CO‚Äôs turn response vs SB 33% pot bet (focus on 87s)
New Player Gets Substituted In: StickyHands
Caveat: A few player types (such as calling stations) will be stubborn and call down instead of fold a bottom-range hand to our raise. Against such opponents, we should instead start value raising more thinly (with our best calls). In this hand, the solver only raises A‚ô•Q‚ô• with the flush draw for value occasionally, with the other value raises starting from two pair and sets. We can consider mixing in some raises with hands like AQ and AJ even without redraws against someone who doesn‚Äôt fold.
CO‚Äôs turn response vs SB 33% pot bet (focus on AQs)

Example 2: Mr. ‚ÄòI Won‚Äôt Give Up‚Äô
In a 200bb 6-handed cash game at the local casino, we open CO 2.5bb with Q‚ô†Q‚ô£, and our opponent who just sat down makes a 3-bet to 11bb from the SB. While we could 4-bet, we decide that being this deep it might be better to take a flop in position and just call. The flop is K‚ô¶7‚ô•2‚ô•.
Our opponent bets around ‚Öì pot (7.6bb into 23bb). While we don‚Äôt love the flop, we call and go to the turn.
The turn reveals the 3‚ô£, a total blank this time, but giving some equity to some draws like A4 and A5 that could be in our opponent‚Äôs range. They continue the aggression, betting 25bb into a 38bb pot, about ‚Öî the size of the pot. Folding is now an option, but we decide that there are enough draws in our opponent‚Äôs range for us to continue. With the benefit of position on the river, we put in chips to make the call.
The rivered 2‚ô† bricks all draws. Our opponent thinks for a while and quickly makes a pot-sized bet (88bb into 88bb). Having studied this spot before, we know that our hand is just a bluff catcher. Our opponent represents KQ or better for value, and we don‚Äôt have good blockers. In essence, our hand is indifferent between calling or folding in GTO world.
Summary postflop action
However, this being real life, we tank for three minutes, during which our opponent takes four sips of water, pretends to make small talk to the dealer, and orders fish and chips and an iced tea from the waiter. Deciding that our opponent is acting strong, we make a marginal call, and our opponent tables J‚ô•T‚ô• for a missed flush draw. ‚ÄúHad to bet the river,‚Äù he mumbles while you table your pair of queens and scoop the pot.
Putting live reads aside, what does showdown teach us?
Is Our Opponent Over-Bluffing?
Plugging the hand into the solver, we see that our opponent‚Äôs play was standard until the river. For us, we could have folded our specific hand a small percentage of the time on the turn. We could also have 4-bet preflop a low percentage of the time. Otherwise, our postflop play is standard, and our hand can be either a call or a fold on the river.
On the river, J‚ô•T‚ô• is a pure check by solver standards. Betting 100% pot produces a loss of almost 4.8bb of EV for the SB.
SB river strategy on K‚ô¶7‚ô•2‚ô• 3‚ô£ 2‚ô† (focus on JTs)
If we filter by heart draws that missed, the solver is giving up a large percentage of the time:
SB river strategy filtered for all missed heart draws
Bluffing with Queen-x, Jack-x, Ten-x, and 9-x of hearts is particularly bad because the solver expects QQ, JJ, TT, and 99 to fold a lot against a pot-sized bet.
CO‚Äôs river response vs SB pot-sized bet
What I would, therefore, deduce from this showdown and what consequently informs how we should build our exploit(s) is the following:
Villain‚Äôs holding consisted of very poor blockers, both for the missed flush draw and for the middling cards that block the pocket pairs that they would have gotten to fold, in theory. So, there either there was no consideration for card removal effects at all or they did notice but there was no respect for them.
Betting this river with this hand is considered over-bluffing by solver standards, so some of our indifferent mixed calls (such as QQ) can be promoted to pure calls‚Äîassuming our opponent doesn‚Äôt change their strategy.
Despite our opponent displaying an aggressive tendency by firing the river with a missed draw in this hand doesn‚Äôt mean they necessarily will do the same in future hands in that same session. They‚Äôre very likely to feel caught with their hand in the cookie jar (regardless if that feeling is underpinned by theoretical knowledge). With the incentive of an image that‚Äôs worse for future bluffs, they could shy away from them (for the time being).
Although the hand choice was poor, our opponent used a good bet size on the river, understanding that they were polarized and that our range was composed of bluff catchers. This bet size should yield him higher EV than using a middling bet size, like ¬Ω or ‚Öî pot. That said, if we see him using half-pot with AK in this spot, that‚Äôs something to take note of as well as it gives us some insight into what bet sizes he uses for his value region.
Tracing showdown back to preflop, we now know that J‚ô•T‚ô• is in the preflop 3-betting range. This could be a clue to their overall preflop strategy since some live players would have flat-called with this hand. So, we have some reason to believe he‚Äôs using a 3-bet or fold strategy with a linear range (but we aren‚Äôt sure of this yet).

Conclusion
Poker players often make table talk and say, ‚ÄòI would have folded‚Äô or ‚ÄòI would have bet the river,‚Äô but the only real piece of information that counts is what you see with your own eyes at showdown.

### TOPIC: calcualting raises
How To Calculate Raises In Poker
One of the most frequently asked questions in poker is how to calculate the size of a raise as a percentage of the pot. Fortunately, it‚Äôs a relatively straightforward calculation that can be done using a simple formula. Here‚Äôs how to do it.
To calculate a raise as a percentage of the pot, follow these steps
Determine the size of the pot if you had called the most recent bet or raise.
Multiply that number by the percentage you want to raise.
Add the previous bet or raise.
For example, let‚Äôs say the small blind bets 2bb (33%) into a 6bb pot, and the big blind wants to make a half-pot raise (50%). Here‚Äôs how to calculate the raise:
Calculate the total pot as if the big blind had called: 6 + 2 + 2 = 10bb
Multiply by the percentage you want to raise: 10bb x 50% = 5bb
Add the initial bet: 5bb + 2bb = 7bb
Therefore, if the big blind raises to 7bb, they have raised 50% of the pot.
Formulas
Here are some General formulas to calculate raise sizes:
Pot-sized raise: 100% Pot Raise = 3√óBet + Pot
General formula: X% Pot Sized Raise = X% (2√óBet + Pot) + Bet
Where ‚ÄúBet‚Äù is defined as the last bet or raise that occurred, and ‚ÄúPot‚Äù is defined as the size of the pot at the beginning of the street. In unopened pots, the BB is treated as the initial raiser, and the starting pot is the SB plus any extra money, such as antes.
The Law of Raise Sizes
An X% pot-sized raise should always lay the same pot odds as an X% pot-sized bet.
To check your calculation, you can calculate your opponent‚Äôs pot odds facing the raise. A half-pot bet or raise should always yield pot odds of 3:1 or 25%. Checking the previous example:
Villain needs to call: 7 ‚Äì 2 = 5bb more
Pot after they call is: 7 + 7 + 6 = 20bb
Pot odds facing raise = amount to call / pot after they call = 5 / 20 = 25%
Conversely, if you know the pot odds being laid, you can reverse-engineer the size of the previous bet or raise using this formula:
Multipliers
Some players estimate raise sizes by multiplying the size of the bet by a certain amount; this method is inconsistent with game theory. To lay the same odds, you need to use a much larger multiple against a small bet and a smaller multiple against a large bet. To simplify things, we‚Äôve created a cheat sheet you can use.

Calling Down Over-Bluffed Lines in Lower Limits
If you are playing low stakes, chances are you have a plummeting red line in your tracker‚Äôs graph. If that sounds like you, have you asked yourself why that might be? There is a common misconception in poker that repeatedly comes up in discussions of hands played in low stakes:
‚ÄúFold your bluff catchers; they always have it!‚Äù
While this is valid for certain spots, it‚Äôs also wrong in many other situations. This train of thought can quickly wreck your red line if you don‚Äôt think in ranges, keeping you from ascending to higher stakes.
The truth is that the general low-stakes population‚Äôs lack of study leads to suboptimal range construction and massive over-bluffing in spots with wide ranges. Today, we will lift the veil and prove with practical examples that calling down light is often not just reasonable but mandatory.
Let‚Äôs look at a pair of graphs to demonstrate my point:
The first graph has been generated by your average low-stakes ‚ÄúABC-reg.‚Äù Their red line is clearly tanking, losing their showdown winnings in the process (49% WWSF
).
The second graph is from a player who studies their opponents‚Äô tendencies and exploits them by fighting more for pots when appropriate (54% WWSF
).
As you can see in the first graph, the red line is falling consistently without an end in sight. Clearly, the second player does something different than the first one, although both graphs are from 0.02/0.05$ Zoom on PokerStars.
To be completely honest with you, these two players‚Äô graphs are actually both mine from when I was still playing at 5z. The right graph shows my ‚Äútransformation‚Äù after I started fighting more for pots. In this article, I will make my case for how and when to raise your fighting spirit.
Key Signs To Look For When Bluff Catching In Low Stakes
Call Lighter More Often When:
Their preflop range is wide, depending on their player profile and position (e.g., BTNvBB single-raised pot (SRP))
Before they placed a bet postflop, their initial postflop range had not yet been filtered
Your opponent is likely betting their whole range
It‚Äôs unlikely that the community cards have improved their range, but they ignorantly or stubbornly bet often anyway, going against GTO‚Äôs recommendation
They bet a size representing nutted hands that are missing from their range (e.g., overbetting in a spot when they can‚Äôt have the nuts)
Fold More Often When:
Their preflop range is tight, depending on their player profile and position (e.g., EPvBB SRP)
Their range had already been filtered considerably by aggressive actions earlier in the hand
Their range hits the board well and, therefore, lacks enough bluffs (most players don‚Äôt find enough creative bluffs in these situations)
Both ranges are uncapped, and they use an inappropriately large size (e.g., large c-bet on a board where both players can have the nuts)
We will explore two different spots to learn how to apply these concepts in real-life games. Be aware, though, that what we are going to discuss today is just a drop in the ocean. There are nearly infinite spots where we can call our opponents light. What I want to achieve with this article is to help you make better decisions and point you to some important factors to consider when facing bets to become tougher to play against.
Commonly Over-Bluffed Spots
1) Facing Turn Probes in Single-Raised Pots
Let‚Äôs look at an example board of J‚ô†6‚ô†5‚ô£ T‚ô• to prove how easy it is for our opponents to be out of line when probing
the turn on dynamic boards. I have chosen BTN vs BB as the example configuration, as it shows many of the key signs discussed earlier. Their range will be wide and unfiltered, and the turn hasn‚Äôt improved their flopped draws.
BB‚Äôs turn probe strategy vs BTN on J‚ô†6‚ô†5‚ô£ T‚ô•
For the sake of this example, I have adjusted BB‚Äôs turn probe sizing from an optimal large overbet to 75% of the pot to create a more realistic scenario, as the low-stakes population doesn‚Äôt use overbets nearly as much as the solver does.
GTO BB Play
Before we apply any nodelocks, let‚Äôs first make some observations about BB‚Äôs GTO turn strategy to better understand the big picture of a balanced probing strategy.
Observation #1: The first thing that catches my eye is that BB is supposed to check to BTN a whopping 83% of the time on the turn.
Facing this strategy in lower stakes is very improbable, as we will see once we look into how various hand classes are supposed to play this spot. But why does this happen in GTO-land?
The reason OOP needs to check the turn so much is that the IP player checks back the flop and arrives at this node with a properly protected range that can withstand some heat to avoid being run over. IP accommodates their weaker holdings in this check-back range with some stronger holdings like overpairs, top pairs, and even some two pairs. However, they should exclude nutted hands from this range in most IP c-bet spots. That way, BB doesn‚Äôt have a clear ‚Äúbest‚Äù option for probing the turn and needs to play a mixed strategy with most of their hands.
BTN‚Äôs flop c-bet strategy
Another reason OOP has to check 83% of the time is that on this board, they, as the BB preflop caller, lack some nutted hands such as TT+, which will 3-bet preflop. Even hands like AJ will sometimes 3-bet preflop, making it even more difficult for them to have a lot of high-equity hands on this board. Sure, most sets are also missing from our BTN range when we check back the flop, but our top pairs and overpairs make up for that gap. Therefore, as the BTN preflop raiser, we keep the equity advantage (albeit a very slim one), even when checking back the flop (BTN‚Äôs range equity after arriving on the turn is 50.88%).
Generally speaking, when the flop checks through, whoever has the equity advantage on the flop will usually retain it on the turn. This phenomenon happens because checking is fundamentally a means to reach showdown with hands that can win sometimes (realizing their equity). Because of that, BTN‚Äôs check-back range will contain plenty of hands ahead of Villain‚Äôs range.
Observation #2: BB‚Äôs turn strategy involves plenty of check-raising with their draws instead of probe-betting them.
Here, the frequencies are filtered for draws, and we can see that they are supposed to allocate their best draws in the probe-bet line only around 45% of the time:
BB‚Äôs turn probe filtered for their best draws
When the solver doesn‚Äôt go for the bet with those draws, it often puts these draws into the check-raise line. Draws like open-enders or better are raised around 26% of the time after checking the turn! Gutshots mostly being check-folded.
BB‚Äôs turn check-raise filtered for their best draws
Since OOP needs to check to us again most of the time, their draws follow suit and play roughly the same way. Having strong draws in both lines disincentivizes the BTN to bomb draw-completing rivers after the BB check-calls or check-raises on the turn. Keep in mind that flush draws like K‚ô†4‚ô† or Q‚ô†7‚ô†, which can‚Äôt check-call the turn profitably as they are missing the required showdown value (SDV)
, will always probe the turn.
I think the point I‚Äôm trying to make is slowly becoming much clearer. BB‚Äôs turn strategy after the flop goes x-x is fairly complex and difficult to execute correctly. Playing straightforwardly by simply betting your good hands and draws is much easier (than going for tricky turn check-raises), which is what most likely happens in the games you‚Äôre playing, especially in low stakes.
GTO Response vs BB Turn Probe
Now, let‚Äôs take a closer look at BTN‚Äôs equilibrium strategy against BB‚Äôs turn probe and note our observations and underlying principles before we move to exploitative territory.
BTN‚Äôs response vs BB turn probe (75% pot), at equilibrium
Observation: Looking at the filters, it becomes clear that our calling threshold revolves around second pair. Our 6-x, 5-x, and gutshots start mixing in folds.
We‚Äôre not going to discuss which lower pairs we need to call based on their (un)blockers because, in this context, card removal effects aren‚Äôt important to consider, as we will soon see. Instead, let‚Äôs zoom out and focus on the fact that this region of our range is indifferent (or close to it) against a balanced opponent. These are the hands that are the most sensitive to the opponent‚Äôs betting strategy, so let‚Äôs keep a close eye on them.
We will do some nodelocking with GTO Wizard AI to compare our response in equilibrium to our response vs an unbalanced turn probing strategy, but before that, let‚Äôs make some assumptions.
Mass data analysis (taken from low stakes) suggests that this is a spot where we can expect the average player‚Äôs betting range composition to consist of ~56% unmade hands. Based on that, our assumptions for how the BB will play this spot in lower limits are as follows:
Not slowplaying high-equity hands enough ‚Äì Two pair+ are usually bet
Betting draws too often ‚Äì Best draws are ‚Äúfastplayed‚Äù most of the time, leading to severe over-bluffing
They‚Äôre likely to find the correct bluffs ‚Äì Most of the solver‚Äôs bluffs are fairly intuitive (as can be seen in the graphic below)
While they bet draws more often, they still slowplay a lot of top pairs, making their betting range even more draw-heavy
BB does not need to find bluffs without a draw, at equilibrium
Let‚Äôs nodelock BB‚Äôs strategy to mostly fastplay two pair+, with the occasional slow-play. According to the reference data I used, top pairs surprisingly don‚Äôt bet too often, which suggests that the pool is more comfortable with slowplaying top pairs than nutted hands. Their draws bet more often when having more equity. Combo draws and nut draws will always bet for the sake of the experiment, but it should be close to reality anyway. Flush draws and open-ended straight draws (OESD) usually bet, while gutshots are the draws that they will check most often. Sounds like an intuitive ABC
strategy to me! Keep in mind that your opponents don‚Äôt always play like this, but it‚Äôs a great starting point to understand the moving parts of our strategy.
BB‚Äôs first in turn strategy, after the nodelock
Now, let‚Äôs look at how we should take advantage of this straightforward and transparent strategy:
BTN‚Äôs response to a bet before (right) and after (left) the nodelock
Here, I have used GTO Wizard‚Äôs ‚ÄúCompare nodes‚Äù feature to compare our exploitative strategy to the equilibrium strategy after facing BB‚Äôs bet.
Looking closely at our new strategy against their turn probe, we can see that the adjustment is pretty easy. Remember our last observation? Our initial strategy had us mostly mixing call and fold (and sometimes raise) with weaker pairs, and I mentioned that these hands are the most sensitive to Villain‚Äôs strategy. Now, we can clearly see that, since our opponent is over-bluffing, we can always call the hands we were supposed to mix in folds with (99‚Äì77, 6-x, 5-x). Please keep in mind that I nodelocked Villain‚Äôs strategy conservatively. We might get away with calling this spot even lighter than we saw in the node comparison!
But What About the River?
We could look at what happens on the river, but I want to teach you fishing instead of giving you fish to eat. The underlying concept of calling hands purely‚Äîthat otherwise would mix in folds at equilibrium‚Äîagainst an over-bluffing opponent, which we just saw on this turn node, can be applied on any node and street of the game tree.
Hands that mix calls and folds in theory do so because Villain‚Äôs bet size is strategically balanced, making them indifferent to calling and folding since no option is the best. The concept of indifference in poker is something that players should understand and apply. To help you grasp this, I‚Äôve included a cheat sheet from Tombos21‚Äôs article on MDF & Alpha, which I highly recommend reading. This cheat sheet is a practical tool that showcases common bet sizes and their correct value-to-bluff ratios on the river, which need to be obeyed by our opponent so as not to get exploited.
MDF & Alpha cheat sheet
It‚Äôs important to note that before the river, they can bluff more than pot odds on the river suggest, as their bluffs have equity and because they can use leverage to their advantage. This teaches us an important concept:
It‚Äôs easier to over-bluff rivers, as the optimal value-to-bluff ratios are more restrictive (towards bluffing) than on earlier streets.
If you find yourself on the river facing a bet, try to estimate if your opponent is bluffing enough according to this cheat sheet. If they are bluffing just a single combo more than they should, all of our indifferent bluff catchers become profitable calls and vice versa (we always fold when they are under-bluffing even slightly).
The other important thing to remember on the river when facing a bet with a bluff catcher is that:
When Villain has over-bluffed earlier streets, they arrive on the river with more bluffs than in theory, making it even easier to get out of line on the river.
So, next time you are confident that you need to over-call the turn exploitatively and the river is a complete brick, you should most likely close your eyes and call again. Yes, even with bottom pair! The reason is that many of your opponents will not know how to rate their bluffs on the river (check out example 2 from this relevant article), which will lead them to either massively over-bluff or under-bluff, depending on what we assume of the opponent. Now, before you go and station everyone down, keep in mind that the opposite is also true. If Villain under-bluffs earlier streets, there are simply fewer bluffs to choose from on the river. In that case, we need to over-fold massively.
2) Facing Bet-Check-Bet Lines As the Big Blind
Another node that our opponents will often misplay is the bet-check-bet node, especially when we expect them to bet their whole range (or close to it) on the flop. On rivers, the IP player will often need to give up a reasonable amount of bluffs to avoid over-bluffing since their flop action didn‚Äôt filter their range.
When your whole preflop range is still intact on the turn, over-bluffing rivers is very difficult to avoid.
To exploit that imbalance in their strategy, (again) it is generally a good idea to call their river bets lighter than usual. For instance, we can consider a dry example board of K‚ô†T‚ô•2‚ô¶ 7‚ô• 4‚ô¶ to demonstrate the heuristic in action. I have chosen a brick 7‚ô• turn specifically because I think it‚Äôs easy to misplay these turns after betting your whole range on the flop. Taking the river card into account is less important in this situation because I believe that they will make similar mistakes on any river card when finding themselves in the bet-check-bet node after the turn bricks.
BTN‚Äôs optimal turn c-bet strategy, after they range-bet the flop
To model the situation as close to reality as possible, I adjusted their turn c-bet size to 75% of the pot instead of using an overbet. Just like in the previous example, we will assume that the low-stakes population doesn‚Äôt know when to overbet. Hence, they tend to use a smaller bet size than what is optimal. Other than that, I nodelocked their strategy to bet 100% of the time with a 33% pot-sized bet on the flop. The reason behind this is that most players you will face at these stakes will ‚Äúover-simplify‚Äù and bet their whole range (or close to it) for a small size on dry King-high flops, even though in this example, they are supposed to check back the flop around 27% of the time.
Analysis of Optimal Turn Play and Common Deviations From It
Let‚Äôs write down our observations again and break down their strategy to understand how they need to play the turn after they bet their whole range on the flop. Understanding the turn strategy will be essential to understand what ranges they will arrive at the river with.
We will first start by looking at some of BTN‚Äôs value bets on the turn:
BTN‚Äôs optimal turn strategy with top pairs (after having range-bet flop)
Turn observation #1: After filtering for their top pairs, we see that they are supposed to mix in a decent amount of check-backs. Two pair+ is betting virtually always.
A balanced turn strategy requires putting a lot of top pairs into the check-back line. Mixing is necessary in most situations when considering a double barrel on the turn to avoid getting exploited when checking the turn instead. Not putting enough King-x into the checking line can be countered by the OOP player by bombing rivers with bluffs and value. Instead, I expect the BTN to bet top pairs slightly (~7%) more often:
BTN‚Äôs nodelocked turn strategy with top pairs
Let‚Äôs now shift our focus toward BTN‚Äôs turn bluffs:
BTN‚Äôs unintuitive (air) bluffs on the turn, when balanced
Here, I have filtered their range for airballs to find out how they should play their low-equity bluffs after range-betting the flop.
Turn observation #2: BTN needs to come up with crafty bluffs like Ace-high/Queen-high without a draw, as well as some bottom pairs. This sub-range bets ~21% of the time.
Villain will need to bluff some less obvious hands to remain unexploitable as played on brick turns, but why is that? Well, if they would only bet their draws as a bluff, OOP‚Äôs optimal strategy would be to over-fold bluff catchers (because the range they face is too strong), therefore improving OOP‚Äôs overall expectation. For that reason, they need to mix in low-EQ bluffs to stay unexploitable.
I expect them to construct their betting range mostly equity-driven, however. So I halved their betting frequency with this sub-range of unintuitive hands (although many might just never bet air here), which now looks like this:
BTN‚Äôs unintuitive (air) hands, after the nodelock
We will look at BTN‚Äôs draws on the turn next:
BTN‚Äôs balanced strategy with draws on the turn
Turn observation #3: When we filter for their high-EQ bluffs (draws), we can see that they are betting around 55% of the time.
Similarly to their top pairs, Villain needs to check their draws back frequently in theory. If IP‚Äôs strategy were to be betting draws all the time, they could get exploited on draw-completing rivers when checking back the turn by facing lots of pressure from the BB. Again, I expect them to bet way too equity-driven, so I nodelocked their draws on the turn to bet 77% instead of 55% of the time:
BTN‚Äôs draws on the turn, after the nodelock
To conclude, we can summarize the imbalance of their turn strategy as follows:
Fastplaying top pair ‚Äì We assume that players in the lower limits will bet their top pairs on the turn too often
Betting draws ‚Äì Their draws will be put too often into the double barrel line
Not betting airballs on the turn enough ‚Äì Low-equity hands without a draw are very likely to check back the turn
We can see that their turn barrel range is too strong in terms of equity. Whenever you assume that your opponent bets too equity-driven, you should also conclude that their checking range should be weaker than it should, so let‚Äôs keep that in mind for later.
Analysis of Optimal and Exploitable River Play
Now that we have a general idea of BTN‚Äôs turn barrel strategy, we will focus on the bet-check-bet node specifically and examine BTN‚Äôs river equilibrium strategy (turn being nodelocked for IP) before we move on to find out how to read their soul üëª
BTN‚Äôs bet-check-bet river strategy, after range-betting flop
River observation #1: Villain needs to be very selective with their thin value hands.
In this situation, the IP player needs to be a bit careful when betting their thinner made hands like second pair weak kicker. The reason for this is that our river landing range, as the BB, still contains plenty of Ten-x and some slow-plays to defend with. We shouldn‚Äôt have King-x anymore in our range as the BB since we fastplay these hands on the river.
BTN‚Äôs bluffs in the bet-check-bet node
River observation #2: The vast majority of their bluffs need to be checked back and given up.
We can see that the IP player is heavily disincentivized to bluff this node. Villain gives up around 73% of the time with any hand that has 25% equity or lower. This is quite unintuitive because checking back with hands that we know are almost always losing feels like a weak play to us humans. Solvers, however, conclude that they have to give up this node a lot because BTN‚Äôs value range at the river is heavily capped, and the river card being the 4‚ô¶ doesn‚Äôt help IP‚Äôs range in any meaningful way. Fold equity in this node is simply not enough to bluff any two. If you look at OOP‚Äôs overall equity, it shows that BB is a big favorite in this situation. If we changed the river to a card that completes draws, the BTN‚Äôs range would become uncapped again and, therefore, would bluff much more liberally.
If they were to play the hand optimally on the river after misplaying the flop and turn, we would need to defend like this:
BB‚Äôs river strategy facing the bet-check-bet
First things first: what is our threshold for defending? While our hands that make a pair by hitting the board virtually always call, pocket pairs and Ace-x are indifferent to calling. As we saw in the last example, we will need to adjust our frequencies with these fringe hands specifically to exploit Villain.
Now, let‚Äôs move on to nodelock BTN‚Äôs river strategy combined with the nodelocks we applied on the flop and turn. We will assume that once they misplayed the turn, they will also misplay the river, which is a realistic assumption. Since I don‚Äôt have enough data after which I could model the situation realistically, I will show you how much deviation it takes from the BTN to incentivize us, as the BB, to make some extreme adjustments with our hands that would be indifferent at equilibrium. I‚Äôm sure you will be surprised with BB‚Äôs adjusted strategy:
BB‚Äôs exploitative strategy when Villain over-bluffs the river (by ~4%)
You might think that it‚Äôs a ridiculous strategy to never fold here and that I applied a tremendous amount of changes to Villain‚Äôs strategy so that we have no folds on the river. The truth is that I only changed Villain‚Äôs strategy to bluff ~31% instead of ~27% of the time for our strategy to shift completely to never folding. Here is the proof:
BTN‚Äôs balanced river strategy as played (right) and their unbalanced one (left)
Now, let‚Äôs just imagine for a moment how much more Villain is likely to be over-bluffing here and how much EV you have been leaving on the table by folding in these spots.
Conclusion
My intention with this article was to show you how to use GTO Wizard AI effectively to create exploits instead of trying to be balanced all the time against real-life opponents who are not balanced themselves. To summarize the big picture, these are the takeaways from this article:
Players who don‚Äôt study GTO gameplay over-bluff more spots than you might think
Studying our continuing thresholds for common spots in equilibrium helps us identify which hands we will first need to adjust our strategy with to exploit their tendencies
Studying the GTO strategy of our opponents helps us identify where they might be deviating from it
Generally speaking, even though players in lower stakes are indeed passive overall, assuming that they never over-bluff any spot is one of the most overlooked leaks for players to fall victim to and can cost them significantly without even noticing.
Sometimes, these stationy strategies will lead you to make some calls, which might seem ridiculous at first. They could also lead you to lose some bigger pots with weak hands, but this is part of the learning journey. If applied correctly, you can expect your red line to stabilize from plunging to eternity and your win rate to soar.

### TOPIC: cbet as oop preflop raiser
C-Betting As the OOP Preflop Raiser
Position is an extremely valuable advantage in poker. Most players would describe the comfort zone as being in position (IP) coupled with having the stronger preflop range. This situation, known as the ‚Äòbread-and-butter‚Äô of poker, occurs when we raise from late position and are called by one of the blinds. Once our opponent checks, we then have the option of c-betting or checking back for a free turn card.
However, the pokerverse expands far beyond this comfort zone. We will inevitably find ourselves in uncomfortable situations, like when we raise from early position and we‚Äôre cold-called by late position. We must now play an entire hand out of position (OOP).
Despite retaining the advantage of having more nutted preflop hands, what GTO suggests we do may be counterintuitive. In this article, we‚Äôll explore which flops we can continue to be aggressive on, which flops we should be checking often, and some useful rules of thumb to take into your games. For this article, we will use the solutions for NL50 rake, 100bb, UTG raises 2.5bb, BTN flat-calls.
Preflop Begets Postflop
Before running through our postflop strategy, it‚Äôs paramount to understand in what condition we arrive there. We must gauge our opponent; what does BTN‚Äôs preflop cold-calling range look like?
BTN flats 4% of their playable hands. The better hands, such as AJs‚ÄìATs, 99‚ÄìJJ, and KQs‚ÄìKTs, are mostly indifferent between raising and calling. Overall, it is a narrow, condensed range that is particularly heavy in lower suited broadways and middling pocket pairs.
When we are the BTN in this scenario, it‚Äôs easier to implement a solid strategy of 3-betting or folding. But when we are the UTG player, we have to be prepared for our opponent to take us to a different part of the game tree.
Something to be mindful of is that in a real-life situation, an opponent that flat-calls you from the BTN is likely playing wider than this range, which will impact optimal postflop strategy. You will probably encounter players flatting all their Ace-x suited, and the lower pocket pairs 22‚Äì55, which the solver suggests are very low-frequency flat-calls.
Having played around with the different rake parameters, a couple of general guidelines apply when the rake structure is changed: At NL500, the BTN is allowed to flat 6% of hands. At NL50, assuming no preflop rake, there‚Äôs more incentive for the BTN to 3-bet and instantly take down the pot without having to pay a fee to the house.

It‚Äôs time to test your intuition with a quick pop quiz before we show the solutions. Here we go:

At first glance, this looks like a decent flop for UTG. We improved with KQ and AQ, and our broadways have some sort of draw equity. Thus, we might expect UTG to c-bet quite often, which would certainly be the case if we were the preflop raiser (PFR) in position.
Yet, the correct answer is actually for UTG to check their entire range.
BTN holds an equity advantage of 53% and has a higher percentage of sets. With clear disadvantages in equity and strong hands, UTG has to be more conservative and try to limit the pot size while out of position.
When facing a check, BTN will stab small about 40% of the time.
UTG will not check-raise super aggressively, as we can see above, just 10% of the time. Even a hand like AQo, top pair top kicker, will generally be played as a check-call most of the time with a small percentage of check-raising. Protecting the weaker parts of our range and bluff-catching becomes a larger priority than outright going for value with our good-but-not-great hands.
The takeaway from this flop study is that we should prefer to take a more passive route and keep the pot small when out of position, even with hands that are ordinarily clear value bets in position.

Once again, UTG‚Äôs optimal strategy consists of a range-check.
This is somewhat counterintuitive as some of you may have correctly reasoned that now both players don‚Äôt have many sets, so why doesn‚Äôt UTG‚Äôs preflop advantage in AA‚ÄìQQ translate into being more aggressive on the flop?
The answer was foreshadowed in the opening sentence of this article: ‚ÄúPosition is an extremely valuable advantage in poker.‚Äù
Playing OOP as the preflop raiser and playing IP as the preflop raiser are two fundamentally different ideas.
When we are IP with the preflop range advantage, there is very little value in trapping with our strong hands because if we take the action of checking back, we have immediately removed one street from the game tree and given up a good chance to build the pot with a strong hand.
Conversely, when we are OOP, we actually gain more EV by allowing the in position player to bet their middling hands as value/protection/bluff and then attack with a check-raise.
What do I mean by betting middling hands as value/protection/bluff? Well, let‚Äôs look at BTN‚Äôs stabbing hands when we check as UTG here:
BTN stabs a wide range, including pure bluffs (QJs, JTs), medium-value hands that need protection (77‚ÄìTT), nut hands (sets, A5s straights), and hands that don‚Äôt really fit anywhere (AJs actually has some showdown value but still mostly bets).
With this range-checking strategy, UTG manages to win more from BTN‚Äôs middling and weak hands taking a stab. If UTG simply made a continuation bet, BTN would have just continued with their strong enough hands and folded their air hands.
That said, BTN still needs to take a stab at the pot here. The BTN‚Äôs range is essentially condensed into what I would call ‚Äòdecent‚Äô hands, with a good percentage of nut combos. UTG has a lot of hands that will just fold but have a chance to improve on a free turn card, such as KQo/ATo, that could hit an overcard and be very comfortable heading to the river.
Thus, BTN has a good incentive to stab when UTG checks, but UTG also has a good incentive to check-raise once BTN stabs.
UTG check-raises 18% of the time when BTN takes a small stab at the pot.
UTG would check-call hands that aren‚Äôt quite strong enough to check-raise, like 99, TT, AQs, and AK. Essentially, these are hands with sufficient showdown value but have poor equity when the check-raise is called.
UTG would also check-raise with a polarized range of strong hands and high-equity bluffs. UTG‚Äôs strong hands feature AA, KK, straights, and sets. Our high-equity bluffs include semi-bluffs like 55 and 66 as well as Ace-highs and King-highs with backdoor flush or straight playability like A7s, A6s, and K6s. These are hands that have some potential to improve to something big by the river, like an emergency exit in case we get called.
Facing a check-raise, BTN is forced into an indifferent situation with hands as strong as 88‚Äì99, which now have to consider outright folding on the flop. BTN would fold their worst bluffs like KJs, QJs, and AQo and continue with hands like TT and JJ, which are now bluff catchers.
In summary, on a low flop neither player improved, it‚Äôs a theoretically sound play for UTG to start with a check. The reason is that UTG wins more with their value hands by forcing BTN to take a stab with their middling and weak hands, to then check-raise with a polarized range. Check-calling with hands that aren‚Äôt quite strong enough equity-wise is also higher EV than betting and trying to take down the pot.

UTG enjoys several advantages on this flop, with more sets, two pairs, and top pairs. UTG has 57% equity. Even having the disadvantage of being out of position, this is such a good flop that UTG can still attack freely when enjoying both the equity and nut advantage.
The expression ‚Äòwith reckless abandon‚Äô comes to mind, but a more apt description here is to take a ‚Äòfree shot‚Äô at the pot that our opponent can‚Äôt do much about.
On this high card heavy flop, UTG gains more EV by simply betting themselves.
Since UTG holds the majority of strong hands here, they gain a lot more EV by doing the betting themselves. BTN has very little reason to start putting money in the pot of their own volition when they have a lot of weak marginal hands in their range, so the previous strategy of checking and going for a check-raise wouldn‚Äôt make sense here.
Finally, a small rather than a large bet is good here because it‚Äôs very difficult for BTN to defend well, even against a small bet, since they have so many weak one-pair hands that could be drawing to two outs. The idea is to make our opponent‚Äôs life as difficult as possible, so a small bet that forces our opponent to either defend some really poor hands or fold a ton works better here than a big bet.
A small bet is appropriate when it forces your opponent to either start defending really poor hands or start folding a lot.
K43 rainbow
Another King-high flop. What‚Äôs the key difference between this K43 and KQ6 that we saw earlier?
First, consider that BTN‚Äôs range consists of two broad categories and a bit of everything else: Suited broadways and middling pocket pairs. The pocket pairs have a slightly higher representation due to blocker and combo effects (6 pocket pair combos to 4 suited broadways). Furthermore, when the board comes with a high card, BTN‚Äôs King-x combos are, of course, fewer due to card removal. That means a large percentage of the BTN‚Äôs range on this K43 flop are pocket pairs below the King.
A large percentage of BTN‚Äôs range on a K43 flop are unimproved pocket pairs between K and 4.
37% of BTN‚Äôs range consists of underpairs from QQ‚Äì55.
On a KQ6 flop, a hand like 88 has an easy time folding. But on a K43 flop, there are fewer things for a pocket pair to worry about. Since we anticipate that our opponent has an easier time calling, we should actually start betting bigger. Even against a 75% pot bet, 88 still has to defend half the time. On the previous KQ6 flop, 88 defended only about a quarter of the time, even against a smaller bet!
KQ6 rainbow: 88 defends roughly 25% of the time against a 33% pot bet.
K43 rainbow: 88 is forced to defend about 50% of the time now, even against a 75% pot bet.
Since our opponent has to call more with these types of hands, our value hands win more by choosing a larger bet size on the K43 flop. Since our value hands want to bet bigger, our bluffs can also use this size.
Aggregate Flop Reports
I‚Äôm a big fan of these reports. They allow us to see at a glance what a solid OOP c-betting framework should look like.
From here, we can see global averages for every action across all flops. As UTG, we should be checking 72% and thus c-betting just 28% of the time here! Most human players are probably c-betting more often than that in this position.
Here, I‚Äôve sorted by ‚ÄòBet 33%‚Äô pot, and we can immediately see that flops like AAK, KQQ, AKx, and KTT are flops that hit a lot of UTG‚Äôs opening range; thus, UTG can always start with a small bet. From here, I can choose to either filter by high card or study, for example, paired boards or monotone boards in further detail.
Via sorting by ‚ÄòCheck‚Äô, I‚Äôve learned that any time there are 3 middling cards on the flop, it‚Äôs correct to start with a check. If I am playing as the BTN and see someone c-betting often in this spot, I will know my opponent is likely to be making a mistake, and I will exploit accordingly by raising or floating in position.
Exploitation
With the insights outlined above, how can we apply our newfound knowledge to a real-life game against human opponents?
Firstly, our opponents may be flatting wider than GTO on the BTN when we raise preflop. This may also mean that they are less aggressive with hands they should 3-bet like suited Ace-x, which makes them flat-calls instead. This just means we will get 3-bet less preflop. And they will have a higher percentage of suited Ace-x and pocket pairs postflop, which we will have to account for, mainly on medium and lower boards.
Second, we don‚Äôt always need to be super conservative on a less-than-ideal flop if our opponent is not aggressive and stabbing enough. Starting with a check is the best way for us to earn more from our opponent‚Äôs stabs. Even better, if our opponent is very passive and only bets with strong hands, we don‚Äôt need to start attacking their stabs with bluff-heavy check-raises and should instead fold a bit more.
Third, if our opponent is a calling station and will simply call all the way down with medium-strength hands, it‚Äôs reasonable to take a hand like a set or overpair and play bet/bet/bet rather than go for a check-raise when there‚Äôs more EV to be had from our opponent calling. The other thing we should not do in this spot is to start barreling airballs and run a big river bluff on a calling station!
Finally, without any reads on our opponent, it would be a good idea to follow GTO-recommended strategy by checking when we need to check, and bet big or small depending on how good the flop is for us. There will also be situations where we mix betting and checking; it‚Äôs good to practice these situations with the Trainer. In this drill, you‚Äôll play OOP as the UTG preflop raiser against the BTN cold-caller.
Conclusion
An IP cold-caller has a more condensed and stronger range than a caller from the BB who has many weak hands that call because they get a discount. This range is particularly strong in middling cards and the smaller suited broadways. As such, flops with a few middle cards are particularly dangerous for UTG.
Continuation betting as the preflop raiser against a caller when IP and OOP are two fundamentally different things. The disadvantage of being out of position for the entire hand means that we now need to play many flops very carefully.
Even on a flop where UTG seems to connect relatively well, such as Q96r, we would be best served starting with a check. The BTN‚Äôs range is more condensed which means they actually hold a higher percentage of strong hands than us on such a flop. Even a hand like top pair top kicker is preferred to be played as a check-call.
UTG can still be aggressive on high card heavy flops that are very bad for BTN‚Äôs pocket pair heavy range. King-high flops without middling cards, particularly, are excellent for UTG.
In terms of bet size, a larger bet size is good when we perceive our opponent to have an easier time calling, and a smaller bet size is better when we perceive that our opponent will have a difficult time finding enough good bluff catchers.

### TOPIC: cbet sizing
The Mechanics of C-Bet Sizing
What factors influence c-bet sizing on the flop? Is it fold equity, SPR, draw equity, polarity, protection, nut advantage, or range advantage?
Range advantage tends to influence the frequency of bets. The greater our range advantage, the more often we bet.
Nut advantage, however, along with fold equity, are the primary (but not the only) drivers of bet sizing.
The following rules around bet sizing are useful to follow:
Bet Bigger
Villain has few nutted hands
You have sufficient nutted hands
Villain has many hands with reasonable equity against the top of your range
The value of fold equity is high
You have fewer middling hands to protect
Bet Smaller
Villain has many nutted hands
You have insufficient nutted hands
Villain has few hands with reasonable equity against the top of your range
The value of fold equity is low
You have more middling hands to protect

If you have a lot of nutted hands and your opponent does not, but they have lots of hands with reasonable equity against your nutted hands, you bet big. You can extract more value from the reasonable-equity hands and are not worried about getting reraised because they don‚Äôt have enough strong hands to 3-bet.
If your opponent has lots of nutted hands but few hands with reasonable equity against the top of your range, you bet small. Betting larger leaves you vulnerable to exploitation when there are so many nutted hands out there, and you will fold out the hands your value is ahead of.
You also bet big when the value of fold equity is high. Getting a high-equity hand to fold is a great result, so we bet larger when that is a possibility. If the only hands you get to fold are low on equity anyway, the value of fold equity is low, so it would be overkill to bet a medium or large size.
If you have a lot of middling hands in your range, your nutted hands have to bet smaller to protect the middling ones from exploitation. You do not have this concern if you have few middling hands in your range and so can bet bigger for value.
We can explore this further with a concept called ‚Äúthe wetness parabola.‚Äù
On what we would call a typically dry board like 7‚ô•2‚ô¶2‚ô£, the bet sizing tends to be small from the preflop aggressor. On a wet board like K‚ô£Q‚ô¶8‚ô¶, we will see a lot of big bets and overbets. However, when a very wet board like Q‚ô¶8‚ô¶7‚ô¶ is dealt, the bet sizing comes down again.
On dry boards, we have no incentive to bet big because of the low value of fold equity (we only fold out the misses) and the lack of draws that threaten the top of our range. If there are also lots of nutted hands that you might be drawing dead against, then that will put you off betting bigger even more.
We have a stronger incentive to bet big on wet boards because fold equity is so valuable. There are more draws that have equity against our current value range and not many nutted hands that have us already crushed.
Very wet boards tend to create a lot of nutted hands in both ranges, which prevents either player from overextending by betting big. Most hands with a draw will call anyway and only the complete misses fold, so the value of fold equity is low.
Let‚Äôs test this out. The following spots are all BB vs BTN in a single-raised cash game pot, 100bb effective.

The Dry Flop
Let‚Äôs start off dry with Q‚ô•Q‚ô£6‚ô¶. The BB checks 100% of the time and this is the BTN response:
BTN c-bet flop strategy vs BB on QQ6r
There is a high frequency of betting, most of which is for the 33% pot sizing.
When the BTN bets, the BB folds 37% of the time. These are the hands they fold:
BB folding range vs BTN‚Äôs 33% pot c-bet flop
The highest-equity hands that fold are just Ace-high, which all have between 43 and 46% equity against the betting range. Most of the hands that fold, however, are trash hands like 43s or T8o that have well under 25% equity. Betting anything larger than 33% pot would be overkill against this portion of the range. The value of fold equity is low here as these are hands most of our betting range wants calls from because most of our range is ahead of them.
Now, let‚Äôs look at the hands that call or raise our small c-bet. The BB raises 24% of the time and calls 39% of the time. Below graphic depicts their combined continuation range:
BB continuation range vs BTN‚Äôs 33% pot c-bet flop
16.8% of hands in the continuation range are Queen-x or 66. This is why we do not bet bigger, villain has many nutted hands and we are exploitable if we use anything but a small sizing. However, there are no hands between 70 and 90% equity, so villain has few hands with reasonable equity against the top of our range. The top of our range consists of Queen-x for trips and it is very hard to outdraw that on this dry board.
We bet small with our value because any other sizing folds out the weak hands we want to get called by. Plus, we are not really concerned with protection.
Another reason why we bet small is that our BTN range has many middling hands that need protection. On this flop, the middling hands are Ace-x, underpairs, and 6-x, all of which can get folds from currently worse hands that have a reasonable chance of becoming better hands. If we, as the BTN, overbet nutted hands, then bet smaller with their medium-strength hands, this would leave them open to exploitation. The smaller bet size with overpairs, Queen-x, and 66 protects these middling hands.

The Wet Flop
Now, let‚Äôs dive deeper and get wet with K‚ô•J‚ô•7‚ô¶. Once again, the BB checks 100% of the time. The BTN proceeds as follows:
BTN c-bet flop strategy vs BB on KJ7tt
The predominant bet sizes are 75 and 125% pot for the overbet. When we make the overbet, this is the range that BB folds:
BB folding range vs BTN‚Äôs 125% pot c-bet flop
62% of hands fold here. We obviously fold out all the trash, but there are some much stronger hand classes that fold compared to the previous example. 15% of BB‚Äôs folds come from hands with between 50‚Äì60% equity.
Some top pairs fold‚ÄîK9s and K8s, for example, when they are not diamonds. K8o folds when it doesn‚Äôt have the 8‚ô•. These hands have almost 60% equity!
We also make some strong second pair hands fold like QJo.
Lots of gutshots like AT, Q9, T8, and 98 wave the white flag.
Most of these hands would call smaller bets.
The value of fold equity is high; it is a significant success for our bluffs to fold out hands with almost 60% equity and not the worst outcome for our value to fold out gutshots and Ace-x.
Looking at the BB‚Äôs combined calling and raising range, we can see that they call 32% of the time and raise just 5% of the time:
BB continuation range vs BTN‚Äôs 125% pot c-bet flop
The key thing to note here is that villain has few nutted hands in the calling range. This is one of the reasons why the BTN can overbet; they are not concerned with getting 3-bet or running into a monster. However, villain has many hands with reasonable equity against the top of BTN‚Äôs range, which is comprised of sets that are potentially vulnerable to any Ace, Ten, 9, or heart on the turn or river.
The reasons to overbet are diverse, depending on the opponent‚Äôs hand class:
It allows for loads of value extraction, with little fear of being played back at by nutted hands or bluffs.
The stronger draws are charged a high price to attempt to suck out.
The weaker draws (e.g., gutshots) can not profitably call to see if they can hit a miracle card.
The BTN does not have a great deal of middling hands to protect in this range. They have lots of strong hands, which on this flop is top pair to a set. They also have a lot of junk, which is low pairs or worse on this board. The second to third pair department is where they‚Äôre relatively less represented. This is a classic polarized range that loves a bigger bet size.
Hand distribution of the range BTN gets to the flop with (KJ7tt)

The Super Wet Flop
It‚Äôs time to fully immerse ourselves into super wet flops like Q‚ô¶J‚ô¶T‚ô¶. The BB checks 98% of the time, and when they do, this is how the BTN responds:
BTN c-bet flop strategy vs BB on QJTm
We have a close to a 50/50 split of betting and checking, with the predominant bet size being small. When that bet is made, this is the BB‚Äôs folding range:
BB folding range vs BTN‚Äôs 33% pot bet
The BB folds 37% of the time, mostly mucking suited unpaired hands that have missed like 8‚ô•5‚ô• and offsuit hands without a diamond in them like A‚ô•5‚ô£. Second pair and below fold, but top pair and above, and any hand with a diamond continue. The best hands that fold are combos like J‚ô£7‚ô£, which has 39% equity, but most hands have under 25% equity. The value of fold equity is low; the majority of folds here are complete misses we dominate.
Now, let‚Äôs look at the BB‚Äôs combined continuation range. The BB calls 53% of the time and raises 9% of the time:
BB continuation range vs BTN‚Äôs 33% pot bet
We run into a lot of strong hands again. 29.4% of hands that continue are straights or flushes with at least 60% equity. So, villain has many nutted hands. The middle hands in this range are top pair or two pair, which have shrunk in value on this board and perform poorly against the top of our range, which would be flushes in this case, so villain has few hands with reasonable equity against the top of your range.
We bet small in these spots because we can run into so many strong hands and only fold out the trash. To keep weak hands in, we have to bet smaller.
Finally, the BTN has a lot of middling hands that need protecting. On a board like this, the middling hands are lots of one pair hands that are well ahead of the BB‚Äôs overall range but are in bad shape against flushes and flush draws. They find it still worthwhile to go for thin value, so we bring our bet sizing down with our nutted hands to protect them.
Hand distribution of the range BTN gets to the flop with (QJTm)

Conclusion
The theory of optimally sizing bets is relatively simple, but the execution in practice gets tougher fast. On a theoretic level, the incentives of bet sizing largely relate to nut advantage and the value of fold equity. So, if you understand how these two factors influence sizing, you‚Äôve already come a long way in theory. The bigger difficulty lies in evaluating how strong or weak these incentives are in practice, in all the different spots of poker and how that then translates into specific strategic implementations.
Nut Advantage
If you have a significant nut advantage over your opponent, you are incentivized to bet large or even overbet to extract more value with little fear of getting reraised. This is especially true if your nutted hands have relatively low equity and are vulnerable on most runouts.
When your opponent has the nut advantage, but you have the range advantage, you are incentivized to bet small with value. You don‚Äôt want to overbet pots where you could be close to drawing dead, nor do you want to bet big to then get bluffed off a strong hand. You also bet small to extract value from hands with reasonable equity against your range that would fold to any other sizing.
Fold Equity
Fold equity also determines bet sizing. The value of fold equity is low if you mostly fold out hands with low equity against your range. The value of fold equity is high if villain folds hands with good equity against your range, which is why we are motivated to size up.
Lastly, it‚Äôs important to be aware of the relationships within a range. For example, the middle of your range acts as an anchor, which the top of your range must defend. When there are lots of medium-strength hands in a range, it brings down the sizing for the nutted hands. When there are few medium-strength hands, a polarized big betting strategy is favored.

### TOPIC: check raising single pair
Check-Raising a Single Pair
In this article, I will address a question raised by Twitter/X user ‚ÄôMatt Riley‚Äô, who asks, ‚ÄúIn what scenarios is it ok to check-raise one pair in cash games (100 bb deep)?‚Äù I believe the answer contains important insights into game theory and incentives that will be of interest to many others besides Matt.
Thanks for sending in the question! And to any of our readers, if you or anybody you know has a burning poker strategy question that you want our authors to look into.
Feel free to tweet @GTOWizard or pose your question in Discord. Without further ado, let‚Äôs dive in!
When Not To Check-Raise a Single Pair
To begin with, let‚Äôs establish why it is generally not optimal to check-raise one pair with 100bb effective stacks, whether you are playing a cash game or a tournament.
Check-raising is an aggressive action that sets you on course to play a large pot.
Check-raising is an aggressive action that sets you on course to play a large pot. There are two main reasons you‚Äôd want to take such an action:
Your hand has the potential to win a large pot at showdown
Your hand can benefit from fold equity
These reasons are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, the best hands for check-raising often benefit to some degree from both factors.
When you check-raise an open-ended straight draw, for instance, you are representing that you already have a hand that can win a large pot at showdown. Most of the raise‚Äôs profitability comes from your opponent‚Äôs folds. But if they do not fold, your hand has the potential to win a large pot at showdown by improving to a straight.
Similarly, when you check-raise with two pair, you are mostly hoping to grow the pot against weaker hands you expect to beat at showdown. But you are also benefiting to some degree from fold equity, as you may drive backdoor draws and other hands with outdraw potential out of the pot.
The higher the SPR, the stronger a hand you need to commit all your chips. This is the main reason why one pair hands check-raise more often in tournaments. The shallower stacks make it profitable to stack off with just one pair.
With a low SPR, a good one pair satisfies both of the above conditions:
Strong enough to get all-in
Benefits from protection because of its vulnerability to live overcards and/or backdoor draws (so the value of fold equity is significant as well).
With higher SPRs, one pair rarely satisfies these conditions. Only the best one pairs meet the first requirement but struggle with the second:
Strong enough to risk a big portion of their stack to contest a big pot.
But tend not to need much protection. For example, when you have Aces or top pair with an Ace kicker, overcards are not such a concern.
Weaker pairs, on the other hand, find themselves in the inverse situation:
They mostly lack the potential to contest a large pot.
But would enjoy a bigger benefit from protection.
This makes them poor candidates for raising. You will have other hands, such as straight and flush draws, that gain more from fold equity while also having more potential to improve to a hand strong enough to win a big pot.
The simple answer to Matt‚Äôs question is that the best spots to check-raise one pair in a 100bb cash game are:
Preflop betting action: In a 3- or 4-bet pot, where the SPR is lower.
Positions: When both players are in late position, so the ranges are wider, and the threshold for what counts as a strong hand is lower.
Board texture: On low flops where hands like top pair and overpairs have the most to gain from protection.
And Yet‚Ä¶
With all that said, solvers do still recommend occasionally check-raising one pair even when none of the above conditions hold. For example, here is BB‚Äôs response to a 50% pot c-bet from UTG on a Q‚ô•7‚ô¶5‚ô¶ flop in a single-raised 100bb cash game pot:
BB response vs UTG 50% pot c-bet on Q75tt
Notice that there are some check-raises from top pair, second pair, and third pair. Even though these hands are generally poor check-raising candidates, there are a few cases where check-raising them works out well. For example‚Ä¶
Unexpected Monsters
The simplest case is when the board pairs on the turn after you check-raise. Precisely because your opponent should not expect you to turn trips very often in this scenario, you are incentivized to show up with them every now and again. This keeps your opponent indifferent to bombing the pot with a wide, polarized range.
As shown on the chart below, board pairing cards are relatively bad turns for you even when you hold a balanced range that occasionally turns trips on them. Without these hands in your check-raising range, your EV would be even lower on these turns (though it would be higher in other scenarios).
BB performance (in EV) on the different turns after check-raising Q75tt
Inducing Bets on Bad Turns
These hands serve other purposes as well. The very worst turn cards are offsuit broadways that don‚Äôt improve any of your obvious draws. The strategy shown below in case of a J‚ô† on the turn is typical of how you play these turns, with a lot of checking.
BB turn-strategy vs UTG on Q75tt Jo
After you check, your opponent can bet into your weak range and force you off draws as strong as 86 and T‚ô¶6‚ô¶. This incentivizes them to bet their own weaker pairs for thin value/protection and couple them with bluffs to balance the range.

Value Betting Rivers
Even though they were a little thin as flop check-raises, you can bet your top pairs for value on blank rivers if the turn checks through:
BB river-strategy vs UTG on Q75tt Jo 2o (turn checked through)
Finding Bluffs
As for the weaker pairs that check-raise the flop, they can morph into bluffs on turn cards that are good for your range, most notably straight-completing cards in this spot.
BB turn-strategy vs UTG on Q75tt 8o
These are turns on which you‚Äôd otherwise struggle to find bluffs, as they improve the weakest part of your check-raising range. That these weaker pairs are pure bets implies they are profitable as bluffs, not indifferent. Anticipation of that profit is built into the predicted EV of the flop check-raise.
But Which Pairs?
In the example above, BB‚Äôs one pair bluffs are hands like 54, 65, and 97, which picked up straight equity on the turn. This is not a coincidence.
Because one pair hands are generally poor check-raising candidates, you must be selective about which combos you raise.
We have seen that BB has some incentive to show up with Queen-x, 7-x, and 5-x after check-raising the flop, enough to make them indifferent to check-raising certain combos of these hands. But because these are otherwise poor check-raising candidates, BB is selective about which they check-raise.
Remember those criteria we laid out at the beginning? BB prefers to check-raise hands with ‚Äúthe potential to win a large pot at showdown,‚Äù which in this case means straight and flush draws along with strong made hands.
When BB check-raises one pair on the flop, they usually have at least a backdoor draw to go along with it. Here‚Äôs the QT they check-raise:
With Q6, they still prefer diamonds, but they don‚Äôt require them because they also have a backdoor straight draw:
As for the lower pairs, 97, 87, and 76 sometimes check-raise because they have backdoor straight draws, but the bigger kickers do not (except for T‚ô•7‚ô•, which is a backdoor flush draw).
Conclusion
Solver strategies are efficient and precise. Nothing happens without a reason, and often, there is more than one reason.
One pair hands are generally poor check-raising candidates, which is paradoxically a reason to check-raise them occasionally. Your opponents may not expect you to have them in a check-raised pot, which can enable over-realization of their equity if you do manage to show up with them. However, because of the significant tradeoffs involved, you need additional sources of value‚Äîat least backdoor draws‚Äîto justify raising them.
Finally, let‚Äôs recognize that these check-raises are only worth making if you understand why you are making them. If you don‚Äôt take advantage of the opportunities you‚Äôre creating to bluff when the straight draw comes in or check your top pair on the J‚ô† turn, you‚Äôd be better off not raising at all. You‚Äôre getting the downsides of raising without the upside‚Ä¶

### TOPIC: choosing bluffs
From Gutshots to Airballs: Choosing Your Bluffs
Whenever you‚Äôre running a bluff, it‚Äôs reassuring to have a backup plan like some draw equity that could enable you to win the pot even if your opponent stubbornly refuses to fold. But is it a good strategy? As it so often is in poker, the answer is ‚ÄúIt depends.‚Äù This article will deal with the questions of when and why it may be best to bluff with draws versus extremely low-equity ‚Äúairball‚Äù hands.

The GTO Approach
GTO poker strategy is all about giving your opponents tough decisions (as opposed to exploitative strategy, which is about predicting what your opponent will do). So, let‚Äôs start by looking at things from the perspective of the player facing a bet. What is the dilemma you are trying to present them with when you bet a weak hand?
If your answer is that you‚Äôre trying to give them a tough decision between calling and folding, you get partial credit. There is one region of their range‚Äîtheir medium-strength or ‚Äúmarginal‚Äù hands‚Äîwhich face this sort of decision as a result of your bluffs. Here‚Äôs the complete answer:
Marginal hands, as discussed above, must choose between:
Calling to beat bluffs, and
Folding to avoid paying off value
Strong hands must choose between:
Calling to further induce bluffs, and
Raising to deny equity to and get value from draws
Weak hands must choose between:
Folding, and
Raising to pressure your own draws and marginal hands
When we frame the problem in this more comprehensive way, we can see why it is often important to barrel with both equity and air.
Marginal Hands
A range consisting of only value hands and strong draws doesn‚Äôt offer much of a decision to marginal hands. They would rather fold than put more money in when they are, at best, a small favorite. The risk that you might be barreling with very little equity is what gives these marginal hands tough decisions.
Strong Hands
Conversely, strong hands would have little incentive to raise if you never barreled with draws. Against a perfectly polar range consisting only of very strong value hands and very weak bluffs, there would be no point in raising. Your value hands would keep betting later streets anyway, and your bluffs would never pay off the raise. The risk that you might be bluffing with equity (or betting for thin value, planning to check later streets) is what gives these strong hands tough decisions.
Tough decisions are the result of different types of hands working in concert to prevent different parts of your opponent‚Äôs range from having obviously correct options at both current and future decision points.
Asking whether you should barrel with draws or with air is a bit like asking whether you should use a hammer or a saw to build a house. Building a house is not a single job; it is the final product of many smaller jobs, each of which requires different tools to complete. The same goes for giving your opponent tough decisions; it results from different types of hands working in concert to prevent different parts of your opponent‚Äôs range from having obviously correct options at both current and future decision points.
Board Coverage
Barreling isn‚Äôt just about giving your opponent tough decisions on the current street. It‚Äôs also about ensuring you‚Äôll have the tools to do the same thing again on future streets, no matter which cards come.
This is why you can‚Äôt just calculate a bluffing frequency and then build out a range by starting with your best draws and working your way down from flush draws to open enders to gutshots to airballs until you hit that frequency. If you were to do this, you wouldn‚Äôt have much to bluff with on rivers that completed your flush draws (nor would you have flushes in your checking range on these same rivers). Your range would consist almost exclusively of hands that were already strong enough to value bet on the turn and hands that rivered flushes, and your opponent could exploit you by not paying off your value bets.
Barreling isn‚Äôt just about giving your opponent tough decisions on the current street.
This is what makes K‚ô†J‚ô¶ a nice bluffing candidate. It may not have much equity when called, but it has a surprising amount of EV because you can anticipate profitable bluffs when you hold the nut flush blocker on spade rivers. Essentially, this hand has implied odds on flush rivers just as a flush draw would. Rivering a blocker is not worth as much as rivering a flush, but both will result in a hand over-realizing its equity with a profitable bet. Setting up for that possibility makes both good candidates for barreling the turn.
Not All Folds Are Created Equal
If you bluff this turn and your opponent folds, how much do you win? Guess what: it depends!
That‚Äôs right, the answer isn‚Äôt as simple as the 9.1bb that are in the pot getting shipped to you, because you would have won that pot some percentage of the time if you checked as well, either by improving on the river or by bluffing. So the real answer is that taking the pot down immediately is worth more to some hands than others, depending on how they interact with the opponent‚Äôs folding range.
Flush draws have a better chance than airballs of winning if their bluff is called, but by the same token, they gain less from folds. When you successfully bluff a flush draw on the turn, you win a pot that you would have won about 20% of the time on the river anyway. When you take down the same pot with a hand like 6‚ô£4‚ô£, it‚Äôs worth more because that hand was never going to improve to a winner.
Taking the pot down immediately is worth more to some hands than others.
K6 is an especially poor bluffing candidate because it will sometimes win after checking, whether by rivering a pair or occasionally even showing down an unimproved King-high. If it were to barrel and get called, however, it would have virtually no chance of winning against a further strengthened calling range.
Not All Draws Are Created Equal
If you‚Äôre going to semi-bluff, it‚Äôs important that you‚Äôre drawing to a hand that will be strong enough to keep betting if you get there on the river. This is the problem 5‚ô†4‚ô† faces. BB also has flush draws in their calling range, so after betting 125% pot on the turn, betting a 6‚ô† river with 5‚ô†4‚ô† is worth barely more than checking it.
Betting this hand, no matter the size, gains less than 2bb in EV. Compare that to K‚ô†5‚ô†, which gains nearly 20bb by betting in the same scenario!
If stronger draws are better barreling candidates than weaker ones, how do we explain 65‚Äîthe low end of a gutshot‚Äîpurely betting, while JT‚Äîthe high end of that gutshot‚Äîpurely checks? The answer comes back to how much each hand gains from fold equity. There are two major factors at work here:
Overbetting the turn causes BB to fold lots of 9x and 7x. While both JT and 65 benefit from that to some degree, 65 benefits more because it can‚Äôt beat those hands by checking and rivering a pair. Although JT would still love to make those hands fold, it doesn‚Äôt value those folds as highly because it retains equity against those hands by checking.
Overbetting also causes BB to fold JT, which actually improves the value of rivering the low end of the straight! Unlike flush draws, the gutshot is a weak enough draw that you can actually make your opponent fold stronger ones, clearing the way for you to value bet with confidence should you river the straight.
Semi-Bluffs Aren‚Äôt the Only Hands With Equity
When we talk about bluffing with equity, we usually think of semi-bluffing with a flush or straight draw and perhaps some live overcards. But sometimes, a weak pair can have the same effect, causing better hands to fold while having equity against the opponent‚Äôs calling range. Some of that equity comes from improving on the river (which also provides board coverage in the form of unexpected strong hands on rivers where draws miss), but some of it comes from showing down unimproved on blank rivers.
When you overbet K‚ô£2‚ô£ on this A‚ô†9‚ô£7‚ô•2‚ô† board, you sometimes cause better pairs to fold and sometimes get called by draws you‚Äôre ahead of or even dominating (K‚ô†J‚ô†, for instance). On a blank river like the 3‚ô¶, you can either check and take some showdown value or leverage your blocker to 22 and A2 to keep bluffing with a 264% pot shove.
Barreling this hand also gives you something to bluff with on a river card like the 8‚ô†, which completes many of your semi-bluffs:
Shoutout to Uri Peleg, who first explained this concept to me on an all-time great episode of the Thinking Poker Podcast.
An Easy, Exploitative Answer
All of the above is important theory to understand, not just for this situation, but for thinking about early street range construction in general. That said, if you‚Äôre currently playing in weak fields and want a quick-and-dirty guide to barreling, here you go:
Bluff with draws when you expect your opponent to respond mostly by folding or calling, and bluff with air when you expect them to respond mostly by folding or raising (which occurs most commonly when they could comfortably raise all-in).

Conclusion
The key to barreling effectively is to think beyond your own hand to your opponent and their range. How can you serve up tough decisions to their marginal hands? To their strong hands? To their weak hands? How can you set yourself up to do the same on as many rivers as possible? The best bluffing candidates will tick more than one of these boxes at once.
Such planning is essential to playing rivers effectively as well. When you think deeply about the reasons why you are including various hands in your turn barreling range, you can make better decisions about whether to triple off on various rivers.

### TOPIC: correct semi bluffs
Picking the Right Semi-Bluffs
As I often like to remind readers, I am not a professional poker player; I am just a writer who is well-versed in solvers. My writing at GTO Wizard is very much colored by the perspective of a student trying to plug leaks in his own game.
With that in mind, today I am writing about a big leak I fixed in 2024. My coach, Dara O‚ÄôKearney, got me on the right track initially by explaining the error of my way, and since then, I have used GTO Wizard to really hammer the lesson home.
The leak was related to semi-bluffing.
Most bluffs should be ‚Äònatural,‚Äô as in they have some property that increases their chances of winning, even if it is not a ‚Äòmade‚Äô hand.
Having a blocker, especially on the river, is a natural bluff as it reduces the number of combinations that can call.
A semi-bluff is the other type of natural bluff. This is when you bluff with a draw and if you get called, you have a good chance of improving to a very strong hand.
The leak I had belongs to the second category. My natural instinct was to make my biggest bluffs with my biggest draws. For example, I would only overbet-bluff or check/raise-bluff with hands such as the nut flush draw. I would rarely get too out of line with more speculative draws like gutshots or backdoor draws.
My logic was that if I were going to take on the risk of making a big bluff, I would want to have the best chance of getting there if I got action.
This, it turns out, is often backward logic. It‚Äôs probably best to jump into a hand to explain why.

Picking Semi-Bluffs on the Flop
This is an NL500 cash game example where UTG has opened, and the BTN has cold-called. The flop is J‚ô•T‚ô•2‚ô£.
This is UTG‚Äôs first-in flop action:
UTG c-bet flop strategy on JT2tt vs BTN: 100bb starting, NL500
We see mostly checks from UTG, who is out of position on a board where the BTN is not a huge underdog. UTG has 54% equity overall, but the BTN has plenty of strong hands themselves, including top set.
A year ago, my instinct would be to make my bluffs the very strong draws, which on this board would be hands like A‚ô•K‚ô• and A‚ô•Q‚ô• for a combo draw+overcards. It would also be hands like K‚ô•Q‚ô•, Q‚ô•9‚ô• and 9‚ô•8‚ô• for the mega draw that is the open-ended straight flush draw, sometimes with strong pair outs on top.
However, looking at these hands on the grid, they are all bet less than half the time, and when we drill down further, the flush draw (i.e., heart) variant is bet the least. These are the checking frequencies of our mega draws, the hands that can turn a straight, as well as a flush if they have hearts. (I‚Äôm using the checking frequency rather than betting frequency just because there will be a mix of bet sizes, and this is an easier way to highlight overall aggression):
There are some outliers, K‚ô•Q‚ô• for example, which is bet more than any other KQs, but the trend is quite clear.
If you have a flush draw (i.e., hearts) to go with your straight draw, you are betting much less often than if you just had a straight draw.
The other interesting thing to note is that when you have a straight draw with a backdoor flush draw (i.e., clubs), you bet the most often.
Why is this?
There are a number of reasons. Let‚Äôs first look at the equities of all the hands above:
In some instances, the heart combos have almost twice as much equity as their non-flush draw counterpart. In every instance, the heart combo draw has more than 50% equity, and in the case of A‚ô•K‚ô• has 67.4% equity.
Can we actually call them bluffs at this point? One of the reasons these hands don‚Äôt get bet as often as the other draws is because they are too strong. We‚Äôd actually hate to bet A‚ô•K‚ô• and get a fold in this spot.
To highlight this further, the most frequently bluffed hand is 97s, which is bluffed 69.5% of the time overall. It bluffs 96.2% of the time when clubs, but only 10.8% of the time when hearts. So, our most frequently bluffed hand is just a gutshot most of the time.
This all boils down to a fundamental aspect of bluffing, which is:
For a hand to be considered a bluff, it needs to be weak enough so that taking down the pot uncontested is one of the best possible outcomes.
These combo draws have too much equity, and we want to make sure we realize more of it, so we check to induce bets and/or see the next street.
An interesting note about why the (club) backdoor draws bluff the most. This is because they have a prospect of profitably firing second barrels on many turn cards. If they don‚Äôt turn their straight when called, they might turn a club, which means they can bluff the turn with a straight and flush draw. And in case they get reraised on the flop, it‚Äôs easy to let go of it. Practically speaking, the times they do make the club flush by the river, they have a very well-disguised hand that most real-life opponents would discount entirely.
Another way to determine why these hands rarely bluff is to look at what folds. This is the response to the 33% pot bet:
BTN response vs UTG‚Äôs 33% pot c-bet
Some small pocket pairs fold, and some Ace-x hands fold, and the rest is trash essentially. In equity terms, our combo draw range was massively ahead of all of these hands. Especially A‚ô•K‚ô• and A‚ô•Q‚ô•, which were dominating the Ace-x and would have been very happy to turn top pair against them. The hands that fold are all hands we would have preferred to keep in the pot with our mega draw.
This was the first-in flop betting range for UTG as the OOP player. It‚Äôs a common strategy to check/raise big draws, so let‚Äôs quickly rule that out. If UTG checks, this is the BTN‚Äôs betting range:
BTN flop betting strategy vs UTG check
We won‚Äôt explore it in detail because it‚Äôs very repetitive, but the BTN has a lot of the same combo draws as UTG, and they keep to the same strategy of betting least often with straight+flush draws, and betting most with straight+backdoor flush draws.
When the BTN does bet, it is mostly an overbet, and this is the UTG response:
UTG response vs BTN‚Äôs 125% pot overbet
It‚Äôs a very narrow check/raise range. All our combo draw hands mostly call (and are calling a larger bet than we would have made if we were first to bet it).
However, the few times we do check/raise bluff with a draw, we do so at a higher frequency with the combo draw that has hearts. It‚Äôs such a small part of the range that it is almost insignificant, but as the BTN has strengthened their range by raising, we need a much stronger bluffing candidate when we reraise with a draw.

Picking Semi-Bluffs on the Turn
Let‚Äôs rewind and go back to the original strategy where UTG checks and it gets checked back to them. This is UTG‚Äôs first-in turn action:
UTG delayed c-bet turn strategy on JT2tt 3r vs BTN
The overall betting frequency has increased as the BTN has weakened their range by not betting. Let‚Äôs see what happens now with our combo draw hands:
On the flop, all these hands were mostly checking, but now on the turn, they are all mostly betting, including our heart combo draws, which bet more than 70% of the time. However, the heart combos still bet less often than the ones without a flush draw.
To see why, let‚Äôs once again look at the equities:
Most of our combo draws are now under 50% equity, averaging 43.01%. This means that they have become much more enticing to bet as they moved closer toward being a ‚Äúreal‚Äù bluff because we only have one card to come. The non-heart draws have, on average, 28.43% equity or less, which is why they are bluffed more often. It‚Äôs a much better result for these hands to get folds. We still don‚Äôt mind going to the river more frequently with our combo draws.
Once again, let‚Äôs look at the response to the most common bet size of 33% pot:
BTN response vs UTG‚Äôs 33% pot delayed c-bet
There is still a significant amount of raising, although a bit less than there was on the flop. The same sort of hands fold but at a higher frequency‚Äîtrash, small pocket pairs, and weak Ace-x.
With one card to come, this is a much better outcome for our combo draws, even more so since there are even a few hands that continue that our higher card bluffs beat. We can ‚Äúbluff‚Äù with A‚ô•K‚ô• and A‚ô•Q‚ô• and still get called by worse straight draws like A5s, A4s, KQs, K9s, and worse flush draws.
What if We Brick?
One last thing to explore: what happens when we get called on the turn and a brick falls on the river? I have made the river a 2‚ô¶ which is the card perhaps least likely to have helped either player.
This is the first-in river action from UTG:
UTG delayed double-barrel river strategy vs BTN on J‚ô•T‚ô•2‚ô£ 3‚ô† 2‚ô¶ (after turn went B33-C)
And once again, let‚Äôs compare the checking frequencies to determine which of our combo draws bluff when they miss:
Once again, our missed flush draws check the most (i.e., they bluff the least); twice as often as the other suits, in fact.
This is a very useful heuristic to note:
Missed straight draws make better bluffs on the river than missed flush draws, most of the time.
The reason is simple: when you‚Äôre bluffing, you hope that your opponent folds. Their folding range usually contains a lot of missed flush draws, but by having a flush draw yourself, you reduce the likelihood they‚Äôll fold. A missed straight draw, on the other hand, interferes less with the folding range, making it relatively more likely they‚Äôll fold.
Let‚Äôs look at the response to the 132% pot bet:
BTN response vs UTG‚Äôs 132% pot bet delayed double-barrel
KQs bluffs all the time, regardless of suit; it makes for a very good bluff. It makes Ace-x and small pocket pairs fold, which is a great result. It also blocks AKo, QQ, KJs, QJs, KTs, and QTs, which all continue in some capacity.
In contrast, 87s bluffs half the time except when it is 8‚ô•7‚ô•. A hand like 8‚ô¶7‚ô¶ makes a good bluff because it‚Äôs almost never ahead, so any hand it makes fold was otherwise winning. It crucially unblocks missed heart draws, all of which will fold. 8‚ô•7‚ô• takes a lot of heart draws out of the BTN‚Äôs range, weighting them more towards a bluff-catcher or stronger.
A quick look at the ‚ÄúBlockers‚Äù tab shows us this:
The 8‚ô• and 7‚ô• are both among the cards that lower the BTN‚Äôs folding frequency by the greatest amount.
In contrast, this is the same tab for the K and Q:
In some instances, having either of these cards increases the chance the BTN will fold, and even for the heart variant, the decrease in fold likelihood is quite low.

Summary
This was just one hand, but it nicely summarizes what I have been observing for the last three or four months as I fixed this semi-bluffing leak of mine.
It‚Äôs tempting to go all guns blazing when you have a massive draw because it is often unexploitable, and you get to put your money in as an equity favorite and give the opponent a tough decision.
Big combo draws, however, are actually so strong that they often consider it a pity to take the pot down immediately on the flop.
Bluffs, by definition, are weaker hands that are happy to take a pot down uncontested. On the flop and turn, it still helps to have outs when called, but they should also be hands that are easy to fold when raised.
Even though it sucks when you play such a promising hand more passively and then don‚Äôt hit any of your outs by the river, you have to be disciplined not to bluff off your stack because there are often better bluffs available in your range.
### TOPIC: counterintuitive calls
Counterintuitive Calls
Solver outputs such as those provided by GTO Wizard are models of no-limit hold ‚Äòem, not a perfect blueprint for what you should actually do in a real poker situation. They are best thought of as instruments, tools with which you can study the game and better understand its underlying strategic principles.
When studying with solvers, it is essential to grasp not only what they recommend doing with specific hands but why they recommend those actions.
When studying with solvers, it is essential to grasp not only what they recommend doing with specific hands but why they recommend those actions. The EV of early street actions depends heavily on how you play future streets. Even if you could memorize and perfectly replicate a solver‚Äôs response to a 33% pot continuation bet on the flop, for instance, you wouldn‚Äôt capture the EV anticipated by the solver unless you knew when to fold, call, bluff, and value bet on later streets.
Capturing the predicted value of early street actions requires understanding what role each hand will play in your range on various runouts and facing various actions from your opponents. Sometimes, mostly with strong made hands and draws to strong made hands, those roles are easy to recognize and correct play in many future situations will be fairly intuitive.
In other cases, it will not be obvious why certain hands show up in certain ranges nor how to play them on later streets. When you encounter such results in a solver output, you should not simply shrug and take the solver‚Äôs word for it. Rather, you should investigate what the solver recommends for later streets until you understand where the value of the counterintuitive action comes from and are confident you can handle those tricky spots. Otherwise, your future mistakes may well cost you more EV than the recommended early street action is predicted to earn you in theory.
This lesson will demonstrate how to conduct such investigations for yourself, as well as a few common heuristics that should help you make sense (and profit!) of some of the more counterintuitive calls solvers recommend in the face of small continuation bets.

A Portfolio of Value
Sometimes it is obvious where a hand‚Äôs value comes from. When you call a continuation bet with top pair, most of your value comes from showing down the best hand and perhaps even picking off a bluff or making a value bet of your own on later streets. When you call with a flush draw, most of your value comes from making the flush and ideally winning another bet or two once you do.
Even with these hands, though, it is not all so straightforward. Sometimes you need to fold that top pair to heavy action, or even turn it into a bluff. Sometimes you‚Äôre supposed to bluff the flush draw when it misses, other times you aren‚Äôt. If you don‚Äôt get those decisions right, you won‚Äôt get all the value of these calls, but you will still get most of it. These calls are easy to find because the bulk of their value comes from one easily recognized source.
The chart below shows BB‚Äôs response to a 33% pot continuation bet from the BTN with 40bb effective stacks on J‚ô¶ 6‚ô¶ 2‚ô£
Of course, top pair and flush draws never fold, but some calls are less obvious. K9 with a backdoor flush draw never folds, even when the diamond is just a 9. 53 never folds, even without a backdoor flush draw. Are you really supposed to call here just to chase a gutshot or a backdoor draw?
No. The solver does not recommend calling just to chase those hands, though that is where a big chunk of the value comes from. These hands also derive value from improving to a pair (even 53 has a shot at winning by turning a pair!) and from bluffing.
Improving to a straight or flush is worth a lot, but it happens rarely. Bluffing or improving to a pair is worth a good deal less, but it happens more often. None of these alone would warrant a call, but they each contribute enough scraps of EV that calling with 53 no diamond should be worth about 1bb more than folding‚Ä¶ if you know what to do with it on later streets. One method to visualize this ‚Äúportfolio of value‚Äù is to chart BB‚Äôs EV of 5‚ô•3‚ô• by turn card. The expected value of hitting our gutshot makes up about 57% of our expected value on the turn. Keep in mind, however, that these turn values include the EV of potentially rivering a straight.

It‚Äôs OK to Fold
Your opponent‚Äôs actions are a significant factor in determining what your hand is worth and what you should do with it.
It‚Äôs not just the board that determines how you play later streets. Your opponent‚Äôs actions are a significant factor in determining what your hand is worth and what you should do with it.
When you call the flop, it helps to keep in mind why you called, what you‚Äôre hoping for. With the 53, you‚Äôre hoping for a turn that improves your hand or a check from your opponent, indicating that their own hand is probably not great either. If you don‚Äôt get either of those things, you‚Äôre probably just going to fold, and that‚Äôs fine.
You didn‚Äôt call the flop because you had a great hand or expected to win the pot. You called because you were getting odds of 4:1 and still had some longshots that were worth chasing.
When the turn doesn‚Äôt help you, a lot of your longshot potential goes out the window. The likelihood of filling your gutshot is cut in half. If your opponent bets again, they probably won‚Äôt offer such a good price, and even if they do, it wouldn‚Äôt be good enough, as your hand is worth less than it was on the flop.
You aren‚Äôt obliged to keep fighting for the pot. You probably shouldn‚Äôt. When you call getting 4:1 odds, it‚Äôs correct to lose most of the time. If you don‚Äôt cut your losses on bad runouts, they will quickly overwhelm the value of the flop call.
If the turn is the 8‚ô¶, for example, you should just check 53 no diamond, and fold if your opponent bets. GTO Wizard recommends folding even to a 33% pot bet.
Note that 53 with a diamond does not fold to this small bet. Especially with the 5‚ô¶, it‚Äôs a good candidate for bluffing. It‚Äôs even a candidate for donk betting this turn, though that‚Äôs a rarely used line. If you fail to find this bluff with 5‚ô¶ 3, you will not realize all the equity of your flop call.

Bluffing the River
Checking with the intention of folding does not mean ‚Äúgiving up‚Äù because it is far from a guarantee your opponent will bet. GTO Wizard has the BTN checking this turn 56% of the time. That means if your opponent does bet, that‚Äôs a significant new piece of information that strengthens their range and makes your own weak hands less appealing.
Checking with the intention of folding does not mean ‚Äúgiving up‚Äù.
If your opponent does not bet the turn, that‚Äôs your cue to think about bluffing. Even then, these are not especially high-value bluffs. On a Q‚ô• river, 53 without a diamond is indifferent to bluffing, and 53 with a diamond is a barely profitable bluff.
That‚Äôs because these are not your only bluffing candidates. That K‚ô¶ 9 that was also a counterintuitive flop call is a more solidly profitable bluff, as it blocks more flushes and the rivered straight.

Getting There
Every once in a while, the stars align: your opponent checks behind the turn, and you drill that gutshot on the river. The final board is J‚ô¶ 6‚ô¶ 2‚ô£ 8‚ô¶ 4‚ô•. There‚Äôs 10.1bb in pot and 35.7 in the stacks. What‚Äôs your play with 53?
You‚Äôve got some options. GTO Wizard mixes between checking, betting small (hoping to induce a raise), and even shoving for 353% of the pot.
It‚Äôs not enough to make the straight; realizing the full EV of the flop call requires getting paid big when you do. If you check or block bet, it should be the intention of shoving over a bet or raise, not just calling for fear your opponent has a flush. It‚Äôs not worth chasing if you don‚Äôt appreciate the value of your hand when you hit it.

Making a Pair
Turning third pair may not seem like much, but it‚Äôs actually a huge boon for the EV of your 53. Facing the continuation bet on the flop, 53 without a diamond was worth about 1bb. Seeing the 3‚ô• turn quadruples its value to more than 4bb.
The gutshot is a big contributing factor; 86 without a diamond is worth barely 2bb despite being a higher pair.
A lot of the value of the flop call is wrapped up in the runouts where you make a weak pair.
So, a lot of the value of the flop call is wrapped up in the runouts where you make a weak pair. But weak pairs are some of the toughest hands to play, so realizing that equity can be tricky.
For instance: what do you do if you check the J‚ô¶ 6‚ô¶ 2‚ô£ 3‚ô• board only to face a 125% pot bet, which GTO Wizard would have the BTN make with 23% of their range?
53 is a pure call, with more value than middle pair, which is mostly indifferent between calling and folding. Before the river, a weak pair with a draw to something nutty is typically a better bluff-catcher than stronger pairs without significant redraws.
How about if the action checks through on an 8h turn and then you river the 3‚ô•?
You should start with a check or a 10% pot block-bet, as your hand has showdown value. If you face a bet or raise, however, you should turn your pair into a bluff and shove. Here‚Äôs the response to an 84% pot bet, BTN‚Äôs most commonly used size.
What makes 53 so appealing as a bluff? For one thing, it loses most of its showdown value once the BTN bets. Calling would be worth about a tenth of a big blind. More importantly, it blocks some important hands: the nuts, but also some sets and stray two-pairs. BTN‚Äôs turn check removes most nutty hands from their range. Their best shot at holding something nutty now is if they rivered it. Because your hand blocks so many of those rivered nuts, it‚Äôs a nice bluffing candidate.

Conclusion
There‚Äôs no way to study every possible turn and river scenario that could stem from every marginal flop call. We‚Äôve barely scratched the surface of one scenario here. But what you can do ‚Äì what this piece demonstrates how to do ‚Äì is consider how your hand will play in a few important scenarios.
What conditions will make your hand good for bluffing if you miss?
How much value can you get if you hit?
How should you manage the tricky spots where you improve to something marginal?
Studying how a solver handles these spots can help you develop heuristics that will be useful in many other situations. Armed with those heuristics, you‚Äôll learn how to recognize these counterintuitive calls ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù, how to realize enough value to make them worthwhile, and how to avoid the blunders that could undermine their profitability.
### TOPIC: delayed cbetting
Delayed C-Betting
This is a companion piece to Probe Betting. It stands on its own, but understanding how to play these scenarios from both sides will enhance your overall understanding of the underlying concepts. A ‚Äúdelayed c-bet‚Äù means checking the flop as the preflop aggressor, then betting the turn.
Many players believe that if they check the flop after raising pre-flop, they have ‚Äúshown weakness‚Äù and must therefore respond stubbornly to any aggression on future streets. This belief is not baseless: by declining to bet, you have not allowed your opponent to fold their weak hands, so they will have plenty of bluffing candidates on later streets. An opponent who chose to bet all of them would in fact be bluffing too often, and stubbornly calling down would be the correct exploitative adjustment.
By declining to bet, you have not allowed your opponent to fold their weak hands, so they will have plenty of bluffing candidates on later streets.
They are not required to overbluff, however, and it is not correct for them to do so. On most turns, you should expect them to check fairly often, at which point you will be able to value bet more thinly than on the flop. If they do bet, you should rarely raise, as your flop check makes it unlikely you will hold a nutty hand. The opportunity to act with the benefit of this additional information is a big part of what incentivizes checking in the first place.
We will examine two examples in greater detail: one where the pre-flop raiser enjoys a large equity advantage on the flop and one where the equity is evenly distributed. Both examples assume a single raised pot, LJ vs BB, in a 100bb cash game, but the general principles discussed here will apply in any situation where a player who had been the aggressor stops betting.

A Favorable Flop
On an A‚ô¶ K‚ô• 8‚ô• flop, LJ has 65% equity and many more of the nuttiest hands in their range. Consequently, they bet 90% of their range, but some hands do not gain terribly much from betting.
LJ‚Äôs checking range consists of three types of hands:
Robust, medium-strength hands like A2, K6, and JJ, which gain little from folds and do not perform well in large pots.
Extremely weak hands with little hope of improving. LJ sometimes checks 7‚ô† 6‚ô† but never 7‚ô• 6‚ô• and rarely 7‚ô¶ 6‚ô¶. This check is not ‚Äúgiving up‚Äù ‚Äì LJ will bluff eventually. These hopeless airballs make just as much bluffing later, to represent a delayed value bet, as they would betting immediately.
Monster hands with heavy blocking effects. On this board, that just means AA. Mostly, LJ wants to start betting their strong hands immediately to give themselves a chance to get three bets paid off. Because so much of BB‚Äôs range for calling three streets is Ax, however, AA doesn‚Äôt give up anything by checking because it‚Äôs not likely to get three streets anyway.
You can see this effect in the image below, which shows LJ‚Äôs checking range concentrated around medium pairs and ‚ÄúNo Made Hand‚Äù.
On this board, LJ retains a range advantage on all turns, even after checking. Consequently, the BB ought to check to them quite often, at which point they can bet many of the hands they declined to bet on the flop.
Thin Value Bets
All this checking serves to promote hands.
Essentially, all this checking serves to ‚Äúpromote‚Äù hands, making them more valuable than they were on the previous street, even when they have not improved in rank. When LJ checks the flop, BB can reasonably conclude they are unlikely to hold AK, AQ, KK, 88, and other very strong hands. This incentivizes them to call bets lighter on later streets, which in turn incentivizes LJ to value bet more thinly than they did on the flop. LJ can also bet more thinly after seeing BB check a second time, as this similarly makes strong hands less likely for BB. On the flop, LJ mixed between betting and checking A9 and AJ. If BB checks again on a 4‚ô¶ turn, LJ purely bets these hands.
However, BB‚Äôs second check is not a license for LJ to bet with abandon. In fact, they now have even more incentive to check their most medium hands: QQ, JJ, and TT. This is a common turn dynamic, where players are incentivized to play more honestly than on the flop.
Responding to Bets
Turn bets from the BB should be rare but large. LJ, having mostly capped their range by checking the flop, rarely raises. The bigger the bet, the more rarely LJ raises. Mostly they are playing a bluff-catching game where the objective is to avoid folding at greater than Minimum Defense Frequency.
Facing a 130% pot bet, for instance, they can call profitably with any Ace because it blocks many of BB‚Äôs value hands. With lower pairs, they are indifferent or pure folding. Their few raises are almost exclusively slowplayed monsters (AA) or turned monsters (44, A4).
This range includes some counterintuitive calls, specifically the gutshots like 7‚ô† 6‚ô† which have just four outs, two of which are not even to the nuts. These calls rely on river bluffs for much of their EV. The obvious hands with which LJ would check the flop and then call an overbet on the turn all have too much showdown value to bluff when checked to on the river. Thus, BB should mostly not pay off bets after checking the river, and bluffing with the rare weak hand ought to be profitable enough for LJ to make calling turn with a gutshot no worse than folding.
That‚Äôs the theory, anyway. It relies on your opponent doing some sophisticated hand reading and disciplined folding to work, and even when it works, it still makes peeling the turn with 7‚ô† 6‚ô† no better than folding. As a mixed strategy, this particular decision offers a low-risk opportunity for exploitative adjustment, and you would do well to fold against opponents you do not consider particularly sophisticated or disciplined.
The fact that this board is especially good for the pre-flop raiser is not a reason to fight back extra hard against the BB‚Äôs turn bet. In fact, it is reason to be wary: this situation ought to be scary for the BB, yet they are shoveling money in anyway.

An Unfavorable Flop
Medium connected flops help the BB catch up to the pre-flop raiser‚Äôs range advantage better than most. The LJ‚Äôs strategy here must begin with the acceptance that this was an unlucky flop and they are not going to win the disproportionate share of equity they would on many other flops. Trying to force it by continuation betting at a high frequency anyway exposes them to check-raises from the BB which will deny their equity. For the most part, the best the LJ can do is check behind and hope the turn card is better for them than the flop was.
The LJ must accept that this was an unlucky flop and they are not going to win a disproportionate share of equity.
Because the turn can so easily improve LJ‚Äôs range, they have less incentive to slowplay monsters. What little continuation betting they do comes primarily from sets and straights.
Responding to Bets
LJ has a relatively capped range after checking, so they rarely raise turn bets.
LJ has a relatively capped range after checking, so they rarely raise turn bets. Even facing a small 33% pot bet, raise is LJ‚Äôs least used option on all turns.
On the worst turn cards, which put four-card straights on the board, LJ folds often enough to give BB profitable bluffs with any two cards, but mostly LJ continues at the Minimum Defense Frequency.
LJ‚Äôs response to a bet is not significantly more aggressive on the turn cards that are best for them, such as A or K. As on the AK8 board, the fact that the turn favors the LJ ought to be built into BB‚Äôs betting range. BB checks more often on these cards, but when they do bet, their range is strong and LJ has little incentive to raise.
When LJ does raise, they do so mostly with slowplayed monsters and hands improved by the turn card. For example, on a 9s turn, they raise not only sets and straights but also A9, K9, 98, and 97.
LJ raises mostly slowplayed monsters and hands improved by the turn.
Thin Value Bets
Whether LJ value bets more thinly after BB checks a second time depends on how much the turn card helps them. On the 9s, which does not improve many of the unpaired hands with which they checked the flop, LJ consistently bets strong but vulnerable pairs such as A6, A5, and smaller overpairs. They continue to check AA and KK heavily, however, as a check-raise from a polarized range remains a threat.
LJ‚Äôs weaker pairs benefit from multiple promotion effects after this action. The combination of the flop check and the blank turn leaves A5 fairly high up in LJ‚Äôs range, even though it‚Äôs just third pair.
Compare this to a Ks turn, which improves many of the weaker hands in LJ‚Äôs flop checking range. Now A5 is no longer so high in LJ‚Äôs range and so never bets. The medium pocket pairs bet less often as well.
Conclusion
Taking the pot immediately is always nice, but an in-position player can sometimes do better than stabbing into the dark by gathering more information before investing. By checking behind, they get to see the next card and their opponent‚Äôs next action, both of which help them value their hand more accurately.
Medium-strength hands benefit most from this additional information, so checking weights the aggressor‚Äôs range toward such holdings. As a result, they are not terribly aggressive after checking. If the opponent bets, they mostly play a bluff-catching game, aiming to call down at a frequency that makes the opponent indifferent to bluffing and rarely raising.
This is not the primary branch of the game tree where the check pays off. Some of your hands will face some tough decisions if your opponent bets into you, and it‚Äôs ok to have no good options when that happens. You got unlucky that they bet and unlucky to hold the kind of hand that would face a difficult decision. Sometimes you just have to make the best of a bad situation. It is better to think of these scenarios as the price of doing business, a cost you occasionally pay in exchange for the benefit of getting a lot of profitable opportunities when your opponent checks a second time.
If the opponent checks again, as they should do relatively often on all but the most favorable boards, the in-position player now has a lot more leeway to make thin value bets, to bluff into a twice-weakened range, and to keep the pot small depending on what their hand prefers. This opportunity to make better decisions when armed with more information is a big part of what the aggressor buys themselves by checking on the previous street.

The Magic of Equity Buckets
One of the most daunting aspects of learning the modern game of poker, especially with solver technology, is simply how much information there is. If you are new to solver study and are then presented with a hand matrix featuring a wide range, a variety of bet sizes and all of the actions mix, it can be overwhelming.
The human brain has devised intrinsic ways to reduce the demands on your working memory. Thankfully, human brains have also built poker training software like GTO Wizard that has external ways to help alleviate things further.

Chunking
A cognitive strategy that involves grouping individual pieces of information into larger, more manageable units, or ‚Äúchunks.‚Äù
This technique helps improve the efficiency of short-term memory and aids in the process of learning.
Chunking was first described by cognitive psychologist George A. Miller in his 1956 paper, ‚ÄúThe Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two,‚Äù which explored the limits of human memory. The research started with the observation that most people can hold between five and nine ‚Äòobjects‚Äô in their memory at one time. However, by grouping data together, the mind can hold much more information.
Chunking leverages the brain‚Äôs natural tendency to find patterns. For example, consider a long string of numbers, such as 1-9-4-7-1-9-7-3. Memorizing these digits individually is not easy. However, if you group them into chunks, like 1947 and 1973, the task becomes easier. You probably automatically framed the two sets of numbers as the years 1947 and 1973 as an easy way to remember them.
Chunking in Chess
The concept of chunking in chess was studied extensively by psychologist Adriaan de Groot and later by Herbert Simon and William Chase. Their research revealed that expert chess players do not necessarily have superior memory compared to novices but possess an advanced ability to recognize and recall larger chunks of information relevant to the game.
In one experiment, Simon and Chase presented chess positions to both novice and expert players. The experts could remember and reconstruct the positions of pieces on the board far better than the novices when the pieces were arranged in meaningful, game-like patterns. However, when pieces were placed randomly, the experts‚Äô advantage diminished significantly. This finding highlighted that experts‚Äô superior performance was due to their ability to recognize and remember larger, meaningful chunks of information.
Chunking in Poker
You already use chunking in a variety of ways at the poker table. For example, by using a HUD
and color coding your stats. If a player has a VPIP of 35% or more, you may, for example, color code that stat in green. You don‚Äôt need to observe every single hand played by that player; the number itself might be enough of a ‚Äòchunk‚Äô to indicate they have a wide range. If not, then simply seeing the number in green might signal enough for you to know how to adjust your strategy.
We chunk in other ways, too. We frame hands as ‚Äòoverpairs‚Äô to cover every single pocket pair above the highest-ranked card. We have ‚Äòsuited connectors‚Äô to describe any consecutive hand of the same suit, and so on. You would not be able to multitable were it not for chunking. You don‚Äôt need to think about the merits of 82o under the gun; you just fold it because it is part of the range you would deem ‚Äòtrash.‚Äô
Equity Buckets
Perhaps the most helpful form of chunking in GTO Wizard, for me, has been the ‚ÄúEquity Buckets‚Äù feature. This has made it easier to identify range morphologies when looking at two range matchups.
EQ buckets ‚Äì Simple
The simple EQ buckets group the hands in the range as:
Best hands
Good hands
Weak hands
Trash hands
What makes a hand ‚ÄòBest‚Äô or ‚ÄòTrash‚Äô is a relative thing. On a dry flop, two pair will usually be a ‚ÄòBest hand,‚Äô but on a connected monotone flop, it might be a ‚ÄòWeak hand.‚Äô Broadly speaking, I would categorize them as:
Best hands ‚Äì Nutted hands we are prepared to stack off with
Good hands ‚Äì Hands we want to value bet
Weak hands ‚Äì Hands with some equity that we want to cheaply get to showdown with
Trash hands ‚Äì Hands with very low equity that will only win the pot by bluffing
The equity buckets are a much simpler way to confer a lot of information. For example, range advantage:
Range Comparison on K‚ô¶Q‚ô£2‚ô†
Equity matrices
This is BB vs UTG in a single-raised pot on K‚ô¶Q‚ô£2‚ô†. You can look at the form of the range (range morphology) and the coloring of the hands in the equity matrix to see this. You‚Äôll see that proportionally, there are more hands colored green and yellow (medium to high-equity hands) for UTG and a lot more orange (low-equity hands) for the BB.
Or‚Ä¶ you could just look at the equity buckets:
Equity buckets
UTG has more best hands and more good hands. They even beat the BB for the weak hands. The BB, by comparison, has a majority (57.6%) in trash hands. I know, even without looking at the ranges, that this will be a range-check for the BB followed by a range-bet for UTG. The result of a narrow, linear range against a wide, capped range.
Range Comparison on A‚ô†8‚ô¶2‚ô£ A‚ô£ 7‚ô•
The image below shows the equity buckets for a different board. This is UTG vs BTN in a single-raised pot, it has gone bet-call on the flop and turn:
Equity buckets
Without seeing the flop or the ranges, I‚Äôd know UTG has a polarized range and the BTN has a condensed range. UTG has more of the best hands and also more trash hands, with nothing in the middle. The BTN has more of the medium-strength hands that fill up the middling buckets. I would expect a lot of large bets from UTG, with the best and worst hands remaining in their range, checking the middle of the range.
Which is what happens. This particular matchup takes place on an A‚ô†8‚ô¶2‚ô£ A‚ô£ 7‚ô• board:
Equity matrices
This is a good example of chunking. I don‚Äôt need to look at every hand in the range to devise a strategy. I can look at the four EQ buckets to understand and derive what my overall strategy should look like.
EQ buckets ‚Äì Advanced
The advanced EQ buckets are also helpful; for instance, they are good at showing who has a nut advantage:
Range Comparison on K‚ô¶5‚ô†5‚ô£
Equity matrices
This is on a K‚ô¶5‚ô†5‚ô£ flop. As you can see from all the red squares in the BB‚Äôs range they miss this flop most of the time, other than their rare 5-x. UTG, by contrast, has lots of King-x and all their misses are much stronger too. They have lots of pairs and Ace-x which are usually ahead.
It‚Äôs easier though to get the full picture from the advanced equity buckets:
Equity buckets
The advanced equity buckets explicitly put a figure on the equity of portions of your range. As you can see, the BB has 77.7% of its range with less than 50% equity, and most of it has less than 25% equity. UTG has 81.4% of their range over 50% equity.
Despite UTG‚Äôs significant range advantage, they bet only slightly more than half the time. This is because of what is happening with the top advanced EQ bucket. The BB has 6.8% of its hands in the 90‚Äì100% equity bucket, compared to just 2.9% for UTG.
Hover your mouse over the 90‚Äì100% bucket, and you will see the specific hands light up:
Top advanced (90‚Äì100%) EQ bucket highlighted
It is 5-x and KK. UTG is the only one with KK, but the BB has every combination of suited 5-x in their range, which UTG does not.
UTG has range advantage, but the BB has nut advantage. As you will have gleaned from our article on the mechanics of c-bet sizing, it is nut advantage that primarily drives bet sizing. UTG bets small here, because they are worried about running into nutted hands.
EQ buckets in the Strategy/Filters Tab
Equity buckets are not only displayed in the ‚ÄúRanges‚Äù tab but also in the ‚ÄúStrategy‚Äù tab. They can be found in the bottom-right corner, under the ‚ÄúFilters‚Äù subtab.
Let‚Äôs explore in the context of this A‚ô£Q‚ô¶8‚ô• flop where UTG c-bets small and the BB responds as follows:
Hand matrix: strategy
The BB mostly folds, calls ‚Öì of the time, and check/raises ~10% of the time for a mix of bet sizes. You can get a rough idea of which hands do what by looking at the shape of the range, but you can simplify things by looking at the equity buckets:
EQ buckets: strategy
Flop BB X/Raise
Our best and weak hands are most eager to check/raise. When we hover over the best hands bucket, this is what it contains:
BB‚Äôs best hands strategy (when UTG c-bets 33% pot)
Our strongest Ace-x check/raise. These are hands (like AKo) that dominate other Ace-x hands. Sets and two pair also raise for value.
It also makes sense that our good hands call. If we hover over the good hands bucket in the tab:
BB‚Äôs good hands strategy (when UTG c-bets 33% pot)
These are all hands that beat bluffs and some value but do not perform well when their check/raise gets called. ATs, for example, is probably behind UTG‚Äôs bet/call range. The better option is to call instead, playing our hand as a bluff catcher.
The bluffs are mostly weak hands, not trash hands. Again, by hovering over the weak hands bucket we can parse out the bluffs:
BB‚Äôs weak hands strategy (when UTG c-bets 33% pot)
Bluffs, by definition, are bad hands, but we are on the flop with two cards to come. We need some level of improvability in case we are called. That is why our bluffs consist of hands like JT (gutshot) and assorted bottom pair 8-x hands (merge-raises). 86s, for example, can make TT fold, JTs call, and can improve to two pair, trips, or a backdoor flush against the Ace-x type hands that call.
Rather than darting around the hand matrix looking for the bluffs, which can be overwhelming, the equity buckets have allowed us to quickly identify them.
River After X/C Flop and XX Turn
Let‚Äôs fast forward the hand and say the BB just calls the bet, the turn is a 2‚ô†, it goes check-check, and the river is a 7‚ô¶. This is the BB‚Äôs first action:
Hand matrix: BB‚Äôs river probe strategy
The BB bets almost half the time. Let‚Äôs glance at the EQ buckets for more insights:
EQ buckets: BB‚Äôs river probe strategy
The value-bets are hands with at least 80% equity. The hand classes are also shown in the ‚ÄúFilters‚Äù subtab, quickly revealing that the only big hand that doesn‚Äôt bet is a set because the only set is 88, unblocking UTG‚Äôs betting range. This is also to protect the checking range.
Once again, the middle of the range plays their hand as a bluff-catcher by checking. If we click on the good and weak hands, we get this:
BB‚Äôs good and weak hands river strategy
Essentially, second pair, which only gets called if it is beaten but is ahead of the bluffs.
The big difference this time, on the river, is that our bluffs come from the trashy part of the range. According to the advanced equity buckets, these are hands with less than 25% equity:
BB‚Äôs bottom advanced (0‚Äì25%) EQ bucket river strategy
This is a valuable lesson that is more easily grasped via the equity buckets. On the flop, we don‚Äôt want to bluff with complete air because we need some element of improvability in case we get called, so we use our ‚ÄòWeak Hands.‚Äô On the river, however, we pick our worst hands to bluff with. With no cards to come, we are better off bluffing with a hand we know is going to lose otherwise, compared to a hand like second pair, which could be ahead.
Using GTO Wizard‚Äôs equity buckets feature, we‚Äôve been able to identify more simply and quickly:
The overall shape of the ranges
The value/bluffs/bluff-catchers
Which player has range and/or nut advantage
This literal form of chunking has freed up a lot of mental space for us.
Working Memory in Poker
Working memory is:
A cognitive system that allows people to temporarily store and manipulate small amounts of information in a way that makes it easily accessible.
My biggest issue as a poker player revolved around working memory. I used to struggle to keep a whole range in my head while I was playing a hand. Even when regularly looking at solver outputs, I found it difficult to look at the shape of a range and immediately identify the value, the bluffs, the medium-strength hands, the strategy, etc. There are 169 hands displayed on a hand matrix (1,326 when you drill down to the unique suit combinations), and I thought it was my job to keep track of every single one of them. It was mentally exhausting and basically impossible.
It‚Äôs still an issue for me, but it has greatly reduced. The equity buckets and other similar filters have allowed me to be much more efficient in my study and play. I‚Äôd say the chunking process has gone something like this in my head:
Instead of trying to hold every hand in the matrix in my head, the first level of abstraction is simply the shape of the range.
Is it a linear range, a capped range, a polar range, etc?
Does it have lots of high cards, lots of Ace-x, lots of suited hands, etc?
What sort of flops does my range like?
Overall shape of range
The second level of abstraction is the equity buckets.
Do I have lots of nutted hands and good hands that should value-bet?
Who has the most trash?
What bucket do my bluffs come from?
Who has range and nut advantage?
How will this influence bet sizing and frequency?
Range broken down in EQ buckets
The third level of abstraction focuses on how specific hand classes play within the buckets.
What do my pairs do?
How do my draws play?
What part of my range becomes a bluff-catcher?
What types of hands do I bluff with?
EQ buckets filled with hand classes
The fourth level of abstraction is where I get into the specifics of each hand. For example, why does a set of deuces always bet, but a set of nines does not? That will be an unblocker effect. 22 unblocks the calling range of 9-x and 8-x, a set of nines heavily blocks top pair, and so on.
Hand classes consist of hands
Eventually, we can reach a point where we are out of abstractions. That‚Äôs when I think about what a specific hand combination would do. Does 9‚ô¶9‚ô£ play differently to 9‚ô¶9‚ô•, and so on. I spend much less time on this level, but when I do it‚Äôs usually for river decisions.
Hands drilled down to all the suit-specific combinations
Conclusion
My biggest issue with working memory was overwhelm. It was simply a case of me trying to juggle every single hand in the ranges I was looking at. Chunking helped me reduce the required mental bandwidth by thinking in more manageable terms. Instead of every single hand, I would think in terms of ‚Äòhow does Ace-x play‚Äô or ‚Äòwhat to do with flush draws.‚Äô Sometimes, you can keep things as simple as this. Other times you can drill down into specific hands.
By chunking, you have freed up working memory, which you can then use for when the situation actually requires more detail.
The equity buckets feature presents you with a much more manageable, easily digestible overview of range advantage, range morphology and overall strategy. It is mentally much easier to pick up these buckets and see how far you can carry your strategy before going into further detail.
### TOPIC: equity explained
What is Equity in Poker?
The term ‚ÄúEquity‚Äù is ubiquitous throughout poker theory. Equity refers to your chances of winning a hand, assuming the pot gets checked down. In simple terms, equity refers to your ‚Äúpiece of the pie‚Äù.
In this article, we‚Äôll discuss:

Types of equity comparisons
Equity comes in many forms. For example, let‚Äôs say you open AA on the Button and BB calls:
Hand-vs-hand equity: AA has 77% against 65s
Hand-vs-range: AA has 83% against BB‚Äôs overall calling range
Range-vs-range: BTN‚Äôs entire range has about 53% against BB‚Äôs calling range
Since it‚Äôs very hard to put your opponent on an exact hand, you‚Äôll typically use hand-vs-range and range-vs-range equity to inform your decisions.
Equity is defined as how often you‚Äôll win if the hand were checked down. Mathematically it‚Äôs defined as follows:
Equity% = (win% + 0.5 tie%)
For example, if a hand wins 50%, chops 20%, and loses 30%, it has 60% equity.
The Rule of 4 & 2
Here‚Äôs a great shortcut every poker player should know to quickly estimate equity when drawing:
Count your outs
Multiply your outs by 4 on the flop or 2 on the turn
The result is your approximate equity.
This works because there are approximately 50 cards in a deck, so each out adds about 2% equity for every card drawn.
Example: Your opponent shoves pot on the flop, and you have a spade draw
Board: A‚ô† 6‚ô† 8‚ô¶
Hand: K‚ô† J‚ô†
You have 9 outs: 2‚ô† 3‚ô† 4‚ô† 5‚ô† 7‚ô† 8‚ô† 9‚ô† T‚ô† Q‚ô†
Now multiply by 4 since this is on the flop: 9 x 4 = 36
You have approximately 36% equity.
Ok, so how does that help me?
Calculate your pot odds. You only need to win 33% of the time to break even (you‚Äôre risking 1 pot to win 2 pots), and you will win more often than that. So this draw is a clear call!
While this method is useful for quickly estimating your equity with draws, it‚Äôs not perfect. If the flop bet isn‚Äôt a shove, then you may have to contend with facing another bet on the turn. It‚Äôs also possible that your opponent is sometimes bluffing, so you‚Äôll have more equity. It‚Äôs possible that not all your outs are clean (e.g. villain may have an AA in the above example, in which case your 8‚ô† out gives them a boat). It‚Äôs possible that more money goes in later if you hit your draw. Regardless, it‚Äôs a useful tool to keep in your toolbox when playing.
This shortcut is best used when facing shoves while holding a draw.

Introduction to equity realization
The problem with raw equity is that it assumes we‚Äôll check it down. It assumes a 50% hand will win its fair share of half the pot. But that‚Äôs not how poker works. One player may have an advantage that allows them to ‚Äúover-realize‚Äù their equity, meaning they‚Äôll win more than their fair share. The converse is also true; factors such as range or positional disadvantage may work against you such that you ‚Äúunder-realize‚Äù your equity. This phenomenon is called equity realization.
How NOT to use equity
You‚Äôre on the BB facing a 2.5BB BTN open. You think to yourself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling 1.5BB and the pot after I call will be 5.5BB. Pot odds tell me I need 27.3% equity. Better make it 29% to account for rake‚Äù. Then you call 72o, which has 30% against a standard BTN opening range. This call loses 48bb/100 on average.
72o may have 30% equity, but it only realizes a small chunk of that equity. The EV of calling 72o is 0.48BB less than folding, so it would only recoup (1.5 ‚Äì 0.48) = 1.02BB after calling a 1.5BB open. Therefore, this hand would only capture (1.02/5.5) 18.5% of the pot.
If you could get BTN to agree to check it down after calling, then 72o would be a fine call as it would realize all 30% of its equity. Postflop factors like position and range disadvantage mean this hand drastically under-realizes its equity.
72o expected value facing button open

EQR defined
Equity realization (EQR) is a way to transform equity into EV. It‚Äôs defined as follows:
EQR = pot share % / Equity %
‚ÄúPot share‚Äù represents EV/pot, or in other words, how much of the pot you actually expect to win in the long run. Equity realization can also be written as:
EQR = EV / (pot x equity), which is just another way of comparing how much you actually expect to win vs how much your raw check-down equity would win.

Examples of equity realization in practice
GTO Wizard allows users to view EV, Equity, and Equity realization. Let‚Äôs imagine that you call the open with A‚ô†9‚ô†, flop comes J‚ô† 8‚ô• 5‚ô•. Ok, not a bad hand, you‚Äôve flopped a backdoor, an overcard, and the 9 can outdraw an 8 or 5. You‚Äôve got 43.3% raw equity. If we ignore equity realization, we‚Äôd win about (43% * 5.5) = 2.36bb on average. Let‚Äôs see what our EV looks like.
Yikes. We‚Äôre supposed to win 43.3% of the pot, yet we‚Äôre only winning 13.5% of the 5.5bb pot. We‚Äôre realizing less than ‚Öì of our equity.
If we look at a hand like 6‚ô•3‚ô•, it also has 43% equity. However, it has a much higher EV due to its implied odds and ability to continue against pressure. It realizes over 90% of its equity.

Equity distributions explained
Range-vs-range equity is often referred to as a single number. However, it can be more accurately represented as a distribution ‚Äì we‚Äôll have some nutted hands, and some air and everything in between. Viewing your equity as a distribution allows you to gain insight into strategic trends.
Let‚Äôs take a look at some of the most common metrics we‚Äôll use to break down our equity, using the BB vs BTN J‚ô† 8‚ô• 5‚ô• example.

Equity buckets
Equity buckets are a method of categorizing how many weak and strong hands you have in your range. Group each of your hands into a ‚Äúbucket‚Äù, based on their equity against your opponent‚Äôs range:
On J‚ô† 8‚ô• 5‚ô• the equity buckets look like this:
As you can see, BTN has twice as many ‚Äúbest hands‚Äù, and only a third as many ‚Äúworst hands‚Äù compared to BB.
Of course, we don‚Äôt need to stop here. We can break it down into finer categories using the ‚Äúadvanced equity buckets‚Äù option:

Equity graphs
A more detailed method of looking at our equity is to straight-up graph the equity distribution. Imagine we sort our range by weakest to strongest hands by (hand vs range) equity, then graph that across our range.
The horizontal axis represents where each combination sits in our range, the verticle axis represents that hand‚Äôs equity against the opponent‚Äôs range. In the example below, at the 62nd percentile, BTN has A5s. A5s is better than 62% of combinations in our range, and has 57% equity against BB‚Äôs range.
By examining these distributions we can see at a glance that BTN has a small range advantage throughout the entire distribution, mostly owing to the excess trash at the bottom of BB‚Äôs range.

Equity metrics
Now that we know how to break down our equity distribution, it‚Äôs time to learn how to interpret it. The study of how equity distributions correlate to optimal strategies is a developing area of research, but there are a few key terms to be familiar with:

Nut advantage
A ‚ÄúNut advantage‚Äù refers to an advantage in the nutted region of your range. A Nut advantage typically allows you to polarize over your opponent, use larger sizes, and represent the strongest hands.
In this situation, BTN has double-barreled K‚ô•J‚ô¶5‚ô¶ 2‚ô£ and lands on a Q‚ô• river. The equity is 50%/50%, however, BTN has a large nut advantage. Their range is much more polarized, representing very nutted hands and bluffs. BB‚Äôs range is mostly top pair. This polarization gives BTN a big EV advantage and pushes the optimal strategy to an all-in.
Let‚Äôs zoom in on that equity graph. Here we‚Äôve highlighted the nut advantage. Dots represent combinations with at least 90% equity against the opponent‚Äôs range.
The nut advantage dictates how much you can polarize, and how large you can bet. Betting larger and more aggressively narrows your opponent‚Äôs range quickly, so it‚Äôs important that your ‚Äúvalue‚Äù hands can extract money from villain‚Äôs value hands after triple barreling. For that reason, BTN must use a polarized strategy consisting of nuts and bluffs. If BTN were to do this with medium-strength hands they would simply fold out worse and get called by better.

Range advantage
A range advantage is a general term indicating an advantage in your overall equity distribution. A range advantage can be specific to certain parts of your range. For example, a nut advantage is a range advantage over the top of the equity distribution.
For example, on this Q‚ô•J‚ô•8‚ô£A‚ô• board, BTN has 52% equity, but graphing the distribution we can see an advantage as the green line is above the blue line. BTN has a range advantage over the middle of the equity distribution, but they lack the nut advantage.
Bet size is directly related to nut advantage. As a result, BTN pushes more of their middling equity using small-medium bet sizes.
Let‚Äôs zoom in on that equity distribution and highlight the range advantage. Here we see the middling equity advantage:
BTN vs BB Equity Distribution

Conclusion
Equity is fundamental to the art of valuing a hand. Learning how to utilize and interpret various equity distributions is an invaluable skill to have in your analysis toolbox.
To summarize:
Equity is the probability of winning if all players go to showdown.
Equity realization is used to account for postflop variables.
We can extract more strategic information by bucketing or graphing the equity distribution.
### TOPIC: equity realization
Equity Realization
Equity and Expected Value
In poker jargon, equity expresses how much of the pot a hand will win, on average, at showdown against an opposing hand or range. The appeal of equity is that, unlike many poker metrics, it can be calculated simply and precisely. By understanding what share of the pot your hand would claim if there were no further betting, you can get a rough sense of what the hand is worth in a given situation.
‚ÄúIf there were no further betting‚Äù is an enormous caveat, however. Poker is all about betting! The more money in the effective stack and the more betting opportunities remaining, the less accurately equity represents the Expected Value of a hand, the amount it will actually win after all the betting is complete.
At one extreme, consider what happens when you are all in. You are guaranteed to see all five cards and the showdown, without the possibility of folding or making your opponent fold or putting any more money in the pot. Your equity tracks your EV exactly in this case, because there is no further betting.
At the other extreme, consider a pre-flop decision in a deep-stacked no-limit hold ‚Äòem game. The amount of money remaining in the stacks is much greater than the size of the pot, and there will be three more betting streets before the showdown. Consequently, some hands with relatively good equity, such as A6o or K2o, have less EV than lower equity hands like 65s. Colloquially, we say 65s is more ‚Äúplayable‚Äù.
If you‚Äôre not sure what Equity or Expected value means, read these articles first:

Equity Realization
Equity realization (EQR) essentially measures playability. It tells us how well a hand will perform, relative to its equity, in a given situation. Equity realization is expressed as a percentage; Hands with greater than 100% EQR over-realize their equity, and hands with less than 100% EQR under-realize theirs.
Equity realization is a bridge between equity and expected value. Multiplying a hand‚Äôs equity times its EQR times the size of the pot yields its EV.
Equity √ó EQR √ó pot = EV

Over-Realizing Equity
There are two ways a hand can over-realize its equity:
Put more money into a pot it is favored to win
This typically comes in the form of betting for value oneself but could also be the result of calling bluffs or mistaken ‚Äúvalue bets‚Äù from weaker hands.
Cause an opponent to fold a hand with some chance of winning
Bluffing üï∂ is the most dramatic example of this, but even very strong hands over-realize equity as a result of folds.

A Simple Example
You hold AA before the flop against a single opponent who, unbeknownst to you, holds 72o. There is $100 in the pot. Your equity is about 88% of the pot, or $88. If you go all in for another $100 and your opponent folds, you win the entire pot of $100, which is 114% of your equity.
If your opponent calls, that is better yet. You still have just 88% equity, but there is now $300 in the pot, so that 88% is worth $264. Subtracting the $100 you wagered, you win an average of $164, or 186% of what your equity was worth before you bet.
Either way, you over-realize your equity. This is one of the many great things about strong hands: not only do they have a lot of equity, but they can over-realize that equity by betting to make the pot larger and/or deny equity to opponents.

Bluffing
It‚Äôs a bit counter-intuitive, but very weak hands also tend to over-realize their equity. That doesn‚Äôt make them ‚Äúgood‚Äù; it simply reflects that when you have very little equity, it doesn‚Äôt take much to outperform it. River bluffs, for instance, tend to have low EV at equilibrium. A savvy opponent will not fold at a frequency that makes bluffing very profitable. However, the hands you bluff with typically have little or no chance of winning at showdown, so even a small amount of EV from bluffing is better than their near-zero equity at showdown.

Under-Realizing Equity
The hands that under-realize equity most dramatically are in fact medium-strength hands, those that have a fair chance of winning at showdown but are not strong enough to bet for value. This makes sense when you remember that equity realization measures playability, how much a hand benefits or suffers from future betting opportunities. Strong hands benefit from making the pot larger. Weak hands benefit from bluffing. It‚Äôs the hands in the middle that suffer from betting, because they risk either putting more money in against better hands or folding to inferior ones.
Those are the two ways to under-realize equity:
Putting more money into a pot you are not favored to win
Even if the pot odds make a call correct, you‚Äôd still prefer not to put the money in if there were a way you could get to showdown without doing so.
Folding when you have a chance of winning at showdown
The greater your chance of winning, the more your hand suffers from folding its equity. Folding a hand with one out on the river doesn‚Äôt cost you much, as you probably weren‚Äôt going to win anyway. Folding the best hand to a river bluff is an expensive mistake that costs you the entire pot!

Estimating Equity Realization
Equity realization does not measure a hand‚Äôs absolute value. Remember: very weak hands often over-realize equity, but they still have low EV. However, by combining EQR with a rough estimate of your equity, you can get a better sense of what your hand is actually worth and whether you should continue investing in it.
Equity realization is always contextual. It depends on factors like position, board texture, stack sizes, and the composition of each player‚Äôs range. We cannot draw a conclusion like, ‚ÄúA9o has poor equity realization‚Äù in a vacuum any more than we can conclude, ‚ÄúA9o is a bad hand.‚Äù Solvers can tell us the exact EQR if both players play an equilibrium strategy on future streets, but in real poker games that rarely happens. Over the felt, you can only estimate a hand‚Äôs future equity realization. Some useful rules of thumb:
All hands have lower EQR when playing out of position.
Hands that anticipate value betting or bluffing profitably on later streets have higher EQR. This includes both hands that are already good candidates for betting and those with potential to improve to a hand strong enough to value bet or to hold an important blocker that will make bluffing profitable.
Conversely, draws to medium-strength hands will under-realize equity just as medium-strength made hands do, because they will face the same dilemmas even if they are fortunate enough to improve.
EQR depends on how well you and your opponents play later streets. If you miss value betting or bluffing opportunities, you will not realize as much equity as a solver would predict. If your opponents miss such opportunities, or if they pay off too light to your value bets or fold too often to your bluffs, you may realize more equity than a solver would predict.
When your range consists mostly of weak hands, the rare strong hands realize more equity. Likewise, when your range consists mostly of strong hands, the few weak hands realize more equity.
Stronger ranges realize more equity because they generate more fold equity. Weaker ranges realize less equity because they are frequently pushed out of the pot.
Equity Realization Out of Position
The following image shows the equity realization of each hand in the BB‚Äôs range when playing an MTT 50BB deep in a heads up pot against a HJ raiser on a J‚ô• T‚ô¶ 9‚ô• flop. Notice that most of these hands under-realize their equity, which is consistent with Rule #1 above. Look at the hands that do have >100% EQR and try to identify for yourself why each of them over-realizes its equity. Answers are below the image.

BB Equity realization
Mostly, these are the strongest hands in BB‚Äôs range: straights, sets, and two pairs. This is true even for bottom two pair and the low end of the straight. Because the BB‚Äôs range is wide and mostly weak, their few strong hands all overperform, even when they are not the literal nuts. Weak ranges expect to face more aggression, so the few strong hands in there get paid more.
Most ‚ô• draws over-realize equity, but the very weakest do not. 3‚ô• 2‚ô• realizes just 87% equity. This is because weaker draws are more likely to get bet off their equity before the river, and even when they do come in, they risk running into higher flushes. To be clear, 3‚ô• 2‚ô• still over-realizes its equity when it makes a flush. But the reward is lower than it would be with better draws and so does not fully compensate for all the other scenarios where this hand under-realizes its equity.
A straight draw by itself is not enough to over-realize equity on this board. It‚Äôs hard to get paid off when four straight cards are on the board, especially if the flush also comes in. QJ has >100% EQR only when holding the Q‚ô•, and even then it barely clears the bar. Keep in mind, however, that QJ has a lot of raw equity‚Äìroughly 66%‚Äìso to say it underperforms its equity is not to say it is a bad hand.
Draws to lower straights do much worse. A pair plus an open-ended draw is usually a robust hand, but 98s realizes less than 25% of its equity. Bottom pair is not by itself very strong on this board, and drawing to the low end of a four-card straight is not particularly valuable either. This hand lacks the nut potential required to leverage implied odds. A backdoor flush draw is a big help, pulling the EQR up to nearly 50%. This is not only because of the potential to get value from a flush draw but also because 9‚ô¶ 8‚ô¶ will sometimes get to semi-bluff or take another card off on a ‚ô¶ turn in a scenario where a different 98 combo would get forced off its equity.

Equity Realization In Position
The HJ, with the benefit of position, realizes equity much more effectively than the BB.
Here is how their hands perform in the same scenario:
HJ Equity Realization
Notice that HJ‚Äôs EQR is higher across the board. Any two cards, in the hands of the in position player (who also benefits from having a stronger range and thus more fold equity), perform better than they would in the hands of their out of position opponent. HJ‚Äôs A‚ô¶ 2‚ô¶ realizes almost 100% of its equity, for instance, while the BB‚Äôs realizes less than 2%. This is because the HJ‚Äôs stronger range enables them to bluff profitably even with very weak hands, while the BB almost always ends up folding the same hands to a flop bet.
Using Equity Realization
You can use your understanding of equity realization, combined with an estimate of a hand‚Äôs equity, to make better decisions about whether to continue to a bet or voluntarily grow the pot yourself. For example, here is the BB‚Äôs folding range when faced with a 33% pot continuation bet on this J‚ô• T‚ô¶ 9‚ô• flop:
A 33% pot bet lays odds of 4:1, yet many of these hands fold more than 20% equity.
Why?
Because they expect to under-realize that equity, and quite dramatically in some cases‚Äì97o folds despite having ~44% equity! Bad pairs, draws to bad straights, and even some Ace-high could call if this bet were all in and they were guaranteed to realize their equity. They must forfeit that equity on the flop because they will play poorly on future streets and often get pushed off their equity before showdown.

Conclusion
Equity realization is a bridge between equity and expected value. When making decisions over the felt, you will not know these values precisely. Estimating your equity and then adjusting, based on the guidelines in this article, for whether you expect to under- or over-realize that equity will help you make more accurate decisions than thinking in terms of equity alone. It will also encourage you to plan ahead by considering what actions your hand will take on various runouts.

### TOPIC: expected value
What is Expected Value in Poker?
Expected value (EV) is the most fundamental metric in poker. Every decision you make is underpinned by one common goal ‚Äì to maximize return. In order to do that, you need to weigh the long-term profitability of each and every action you take.
Expected value is how much you expect to win or lose with a specific play over the long run.

Where does EV come from?
Let‚Äôs imagine you played a game where everyone checked down every hand. Obviously, no one would have an edge because equity is evenly distributed. In order to gain you need to win more than your fair share.
So, where does EV come from? In its purest form expected value comes from organizing your equity more efficiently than your opponents. That means putting the right kind of hands into your betting/checking lines, knowing how to utilize sizing, knowing which hands are profitable enough to continue, and which hands to let go.
There are only two ways to win chips in poker; win the pot at showdown, or make everyone else fold. For this reason, most HUDs will organize your results graph into red/blue lines, indicating chips won with and without showdown. It then follows that there are two types of EV:
Showdown EV ‚Äì Chips won/lost at showdown
Fold EV ‚Äì Chips won/lost from folding or making your opponents fold
Fold EV, denying equity and folding out worse
One of the most fundamental aspects of fold EV is this: You cannot gain from folding hands that have no chance of winning against you. You gain from folding hands that could have beaten you.
If you have the nuts on the river, you can only gain EV by making worse hands put in money. This is the simplest example of gaining ‚ÄúShowdown EV‚Äù. You don‚Äôt gain anything from folding out worse hands (all you‚Äôre doing is shifting your ‚Äúshowdown EV‚Äù into ‚Äúfold EV‚Äù). The only way to gain from folding your opponent‚Äôs 0% hands is if those hands could have bluffed you off your equity later.
Let‚Äôs say you bet top-two on the turn, and your opponent folds a flush draw. You gain EV from folding worse hands that can outdraw you, however, you also gain EV when worse hands call you. Denying equity from worse hands that can outdraw you can be thought of as a form of fold equity.
Typically you‚Äôd rather have worse hands call you. But if those worse hands have high implied odds against your hand it may actually be preferable to see them fold. This ties into the concept of over-realizing your equity.
Thin block-bet example
Let‚Äôs say you have 2nd pair, out of position, and block-bet the river. You‚Äôre gonna get called by better sometimes, you‚Äôre gonna get called by worse sometimes, you‚Äôre gonna get raised sometimes, and you‚Äôll fold out hands that you had beat anyway. Did you gain anything from making worse hands fold?
The answer might be yes. Those worse hands that fold may have bluffed you off your pair had you checked. This block-bet may even have a negative showdown EV and still be the best play. This is why you‚Äôll sometimes see solvers block-bet OOP with value hands that have less than 50% equity when called.

EV relativity
One of the most common misconceptions about expected value is that ‚Äúfolding is always 0 EV‚Äù. However, this is only true if you choose to define folding as 0. You could also measure EV as the difference in stacks relative to the start of a hand. This perspective is equally valid.
Imagine you 3bet to 11bb and face a 4bet of 25bb. If you fold, you‚Äôve just lost 11bb. If you do that 100 times you‚Äôll lose 1100bb! So how can this be if folding is always 0 EV?
From the perspective of your decision facing a 4bet, your original 11bb raise is a sunk cost, and folding can be considered 0EV. From the standpoint of your starting stack, folding lost 11bb. Both perspectives are valid. All you‚Äôre doing is comparing the EV of different strategic choices at the end of the day.
It‚Äôs important to realize that EV is always measured relative to something else. If you define folding as 0EV, then the EV of calling is relative to the EV of folding.
Here‚Äôs an example. You 3bet AQs on the BB and face a 25bb 4bet from the BTN. You have 3 choices: fold, call or shove. If you look at the EV of these options in GTO Wizard, you‚Äôll see something like this:
As measured from your decision facing the 4bet: Folding is 0bb, calling is 4.02bb, and shoving is 2.58bb. These numbers above can be misleading. It makes it seem like calling and shoving are both ‚Äúprofitable‚Äù.
If you instead measure EV relative to your stack at the start of the round:
Folding is -11bb, calling is -6.98bb (4.02 better than folding), and shoving is -8.42bb (2.58 better than folding).
So regardless of how you look at it, calling is the best option, and it‚Äôs better than folding by exactly 4.02bb. But you need to realize that you‚Äôre deciding between 3 losing actions and trying to find the one that loses the least! It‚Äôs important to recognize this concept to put EV into context. These marginal ‚Äútry and lose the least‚Äù spots constantly happen in poker.

EV Units of measurement
There are many different ways to measure EV. The most common way is to measure it in ‚Äúbb‚Äù or ‚Äúbig blinds‚Äù. However, you can also measure EV in chips or pot share. For example, if you expect to win 3bb, and the pot is 5bb, you could say you have 60% EV (as measured by pot share, the same way we measure EQ). One result of this measurement is that you can have greater than 100% EV. This simply means you expect to win the pot and then some, in the long run.
Measuring your EV as a percentage has the benefit of putting things into perspective. For example, is 2bb a lot? Well, if the pot is 1000bb it‚Äôs extremely marginal, but if the pot is 5bb then it‚Äôs significant.
Tournament players must take an additional step and transform their EV into tournament value using something like ICM, DCM, or FGS. We‚Äôll discuss the complications of transforming chip-EV into tournament-EV in later articles.

EV defined
The expected value is a weighted average that encompasses all future actions. The simplest definition looks like this:
EV = (Outcome1 probability x Outcome1 payoff) + (Outcome2 probability x Outcome2 payoff) + (Outcome3 probability x Outcome3 payoff)‚Ä¶
The box method:
List all the possible outcomes. (Make the boxes)
Find the probability and payoff of each outcome. (Fill the boxes)
Put it all together in an equation and work it out. (Solve the boxes)
Calculation examples
Example 1:
Let‚Äôs start with a simple example. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre facing a pot-sized shove with a 25% equity draw. If you call there are two possible outcomes, you win or you lose (excluding ties). If you win, you‚Äôll gain the pot, and your opponents bet. If you lose, you‚Äôll lose a pot-sized bet‚Ä¶
Win: 25% (+2 pot)
Lose: 75% (-1 pot)
EV = (25% x 2) + (75% x -1) = -0.25 pot
Clearly, this is not a good call as you‚Äôd lose 25% of the pot on average.
Example 2:
Now let‚Äôs imagine your opponent shoves half-pot, and you have 35% equity. You‚Äôre risking half a pot to win 1.5 pots (your opponent‚Äôs half-pot bet + the pot).
EV = (35% x 1.5) ‚Äì (65% x 0.5) = +0.2 pot , winning 20% of the pot on average.
Example 3:
Let‚Äôs get a little more complex. We have the option to bet pot (10bb) on the river with top pair, but our opponent might shove and force us to fold.
Equity when checking back: 70%
Equity when we get called: 55%
Opponent will shove (and we‚Äôll fold) 20% of the time
Opponent will fold 50% of the time
Opponent will call 30% of the time
Is value betting too thin?
Payoff when we bet and get called = (55% * 20bb) + (45% * -10bb) = +6.5bb
Payoff when they fold = +10bb
Payoff when they raise = -10bb
EV bet = (fold% x 10bb) + (call% x 6.5bb) + (raise% x -10bb)
EV bet = (50% x 10bb) + (30% x 6.5bb) + (20% x -10bb) = +4.95bb
Hooray, the bet is +EV! That means we should bet right?! No. You need to weigh your options.
Checking back has 70% equity, which means we win 70% of the pot (7bb).
EV (bet) = +4.95bb
EV (check) +7.00bb
Betting loses 2.05bb of value since we‚Äôll often get bluffed off our equity, fold worse and get called by better. Checking is clearly the best option here!
The full diagram looks like this:
Deriving other poker metrics from EV
Every poker metric you‚Äôve ever heard of can be derived from an expected value equation!
Let‚Äôs start with pot odds. Pot odds refer to how much equity you need to call a bet. For example, let‚Äôs say OOP bets half-pot on the river. How much equity would IP need to make this call?
The classic way to solve this is to use the simple equation:
Required equity = (call) / (pot after you call)
For a halfpot bet: 0.5 / 2 = 25%; IP needs at least 25% equity to call this bet. Another way to say this is that IP needs to recoup at least as much money as they put into the pot.
However, this can also be calculated using the expected value. The benefit of this method is that it allows you to calculate more than just the break-even point. You can see exactly how much you‚Äôd gain or lose given some bet size and a certain amount of equity.
EV = (Win% x $Won) ‚Äì (Lose% x $Lost)
$Won = 1.5 (the pot plus villain‚Äôs half pot bet)
$Lost = 0.5 (the amount to call)
Win% = EQ
Lose% = 1-EQ
EV = (EQ x 1.5) ‚Äì ((1-EQ) x 0.5)
We can find the break-even point by setting EV to 0:
0 = (EQ x 1.5) ‚Äì ((1 ‚Äì EQ) x 0.5)
1.5 EQ = 0.5 (1 ‚Äì EQ)
3 EQ = 1 ‚Äì EQ
4EQ = 1
EQ = ¬º
EQ = 25%
In other words, you need 25% equity to break even.
Alpha ‚Äì refers to how often the villain needs to fold for you to break even with a 0% equity bluff. The classic equation looks like this:
risk/(risk+reward)
Where risk is the amount to bluff and reward is the pot you gain if they fold. For a half‚Äìpot bluff, the risk is 0.5 and the reward is 1.
0.5 / (0.5 + 1) = 33.3%
But what if they fold more or less? How profitable is the bluff then? Well, we can use an expected value equation to find out!
EV = (pot x fold%) ‚Äì (bet x call%)
Now let‚Äôs derive alpha using EV:
Set EV to 0 in order to find the break-even point:
0 = (1 x fold%) ‚Äì (0.5 x call%)
0 = fold% ‚Äì (0.5 (1 ‚Äì fold%))
fold% = (1 ‚Äì fold%) / 2
2 fold% = 1 ‚Äì fold%
3 fold% = 1
fold% = ‚Öì = 33%
OOP MDF: Refers to the % of time OOP must call in order to prevent IP from having a profitable bluff with a 0% equity hand. We won‚Äôt go through the exact derivation as this is just equal to 1-alpha which we‚Äôve already calculated above.
MDF = pot/(pot+call)
MDF = 1 / (1 + 0.5) = 66.6%
Or simply 1- alpha.

Conclusion
The art of valuing a hand is nuanced, complex, and can take a lifetime to master. Expected value is a key metric to every poker decision you‚Äôll ever make.
Does this mean you need to be performing complex math in your head at the table? No, of course not, poker is more intuitive in practice. But you do need to understand how EV works in order to correctly think through your decisions, understand solvers, or do proper off-table analysis. Having worked through different scenarios off the table gives you a much better sense of what is and is not a good strategy.
### TOPIC: exploitative dynamics
Exploitative Dynamics
GTO solutions are designed to be unexploitable, performing reasonably well no matter how your opponents play. They achieve this by assuming that when there is a best option with a given hand, your opponents will make that play. Thus, the GTO approach is to play in a way that minimizes the amount and profitability of good options available to your opponents.
In other words, GTO solutions do not incorporate or rely upon any assumptions about mistakes your opponents will make. This makes them robust against any strategy, no matter how unpredictable, your opponents might throw at you. However, it also limits their ability to profit from any mistakes your opponents do make. To be clear, GTO strategies will profit from many common mistakes; they just won‚Äôt profit as much as an exploitable strategy designed to take maximum advantage of those mistakes.
GTO strategies will profit from many common mistakes; they just won‚Äôt profit as much as an exploitable strategy designed to take maximum advantage of those mistakes.
When you can predict specific mistakes your opponents will make, you should deviate from unexploitable play in order to take advantage of those mistakes. This is not a violation of GTO. It is the same thing a solver would do if you were to ‚Äúteach‚Äù it about the mistakes you planned to exploit (which you can via nodelocking).
For more on the differences between GTO and exploitative approaches, see this piece.

Mixed Strategies and Sensitivity
Some parts of a GTO strategy are more sensitive to your opponents‚Äô response than others. For example, raising AA on the BTN will certainly be the best play in a 100bb cash game, regardless of who‚Äôs in the blinds. Folding 72o in the same spot will also be the best play, absent some very big mistakes from the players in the blinds. But hands like A3o or T4‚ô† could go either way, depending on how the blinds react to your raise.
How do we know this? Have a look at the chart below, which shows BTN‚Äôs opening range. The number in the lower right of each box is the EV of that hand if your opponents respond perfectly.
Of course, with Aces the decision is not close, but this is true for many lesser hands as well. ATo and J8‚ô† are such profitable opens at equilibrium that they show a profit no matter how the blinds respond. Even if the blinds call or three-bet more than a solver would, these opens will still be profitable. They may even gain EV! Conversely, 72o is so far from being a profitable open that even if the blinds call or three-bet somewhat less than optimally, you are still unlikely to show a profit with it.
For many hands, however, raising and folding have similar EVs at equilibrium, which means either option could be superior if your opponents do not respond perfectly. For any mixed strategy, the EV of all options in the mix must be identical. If they weren‚Äôt, the solver would prefer one action over the other. This means even a slight deviation from your opponents could make one option more profitable.
Even pure strategies can be quite sensitive, however. Notice the EV of opening T4‚ô† into blinds who will play perfectly is only -0.01 bb. If the blinds fold too often, or if they do not three-bet enough, allowing you to realize more equity than the solver expects, this could become a profitable open. Conversely, even T6‚ô†, which the solver shows as a pure open, could become unprofitable and therefore a pure fold against blinds who 3-bet too often. The closer the hand is to the thresholds, the more sensitive it is to the responses of the players behind you.

The Four-Step Exploitative Process
In my book, Play Optimal Poker, I recommend a four-step process for exploitative thinking:
1) Envision the Equilibrium
Ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow would this hand play out if my opponents and I were replaced by game theoretically optimal supercomputers?‚Äù You aren‚Äôt a game theoretically optimal supercomputer, so you won‚Äôt be able to answer this precisely, but you should consider factors like:
Which player should be more inclined to bet?
What kind of range should each player bet?
Which are the best hands for each player to value bet?
If I bet, what should my opponent‚Äôs raising range look like?
What are the weakest hands with which my opponent ought to commit his entire stack?
Once you have a sense of what your opponent‚Äôs equilibrium strategy ought to look like, it will be easier to envision how they are likely to deviate from it. Then, you can think about how to take advantage of those deviations.
Once you have a sense of what your opponent‚Äôs equilibrium strategy ought to look like, it will be easier to envision how they are likely to deviate from it.
If you‚Äôre new to game theory, this will probably be the hardest step in the entire process. The good news is that it‚Äôs not an all-or-nothing proposition: even if you get only the rough contours correct (‚ÄúI should mostly check, and my opponent should mostly bet‚Äù) that‚Äôs still a big step up from not thinking about the equilibrium at all. With practice, experience, and study, you‚Äôll get better and better at envisioning equilibria.
2) Make a Read
Ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow is my opponent deviating from the equilibrium?‚Äù Be explicit about this, and as specific as you can. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre calling too often with pure bluff-catchers on the river,‚Äù is more useful than ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre too loose‚Äù or ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre a fish.‚Äù It‚Äôs OK if all you have are hunches. It‚Äôs rare to have a surefire read, just as it‚Äôs rare to have a surefire winning hand. Poker is fundamentally a game about making decisions under conditions of uncertainty. Later in the process, we‚Äôll account for your confidence in your read.
3) Identify the Exploits
Once you identify a likely deviation from the equilibrium strategy, ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat can I do to exploit this mistake?‚Äù Once again, you want to be as precise and specific as possible. You also want to be creative, as there is often more than one potential exploit for a particular mistake.
4) Determine the Degree of Deviation
Ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow far should I deviate from the equilibrium?‚Äú
Suppose your opponent doesn‚Äôt seem to bluff enough on the river, and you plan to exploit them by folding more often. The next step is to determine how much more often. Does this just mean folding when the decision would otherwise be close? Is it as extreme as folding the second nuts? Or is it somewhere in between?
There‚Äôs a strong situational component to this ‚Äì it‚Äôs harder to find bluffs on some rivers than on others ‚Äì but two factors you can consider in advance are the magnitude of your opponent‚Äôs mistake and the degree of confidence you have in your read. Remember that in order to exploit an opponent who seems to be deviating from his equilibrium strategy, you must deviate from your own equilibrium. This, in turn, raises the possibility that you will be exploited if you are wrong about your read.
The larger your deviation from the equilibrium, the greater the penalty for being wrong, which is why larger deviations require stronger reads.

Demonstration
Let‚Äôs consider a simplified river scenario where the final board is 22223. The IP player has a range of 44-AA, while OOP has only the middling hands in that range, 77-JJ. There is $100 in the pot. IP may either bet $100 or check. If they bet, OOP may call or fold (even if they were allowed to bet or raise, they would never want to do so).
IP‚Äôs equilibrium or GTO strategy is to bet anything JJ or better and to bluff with some combination of 44, 55, and 66 (it doesn‚Äôt matter which, as all are equally worthless) at a frequency that makes OOP indifferent to bluff-catching.
The value bets are all pure strategies, which means betting is definitively better than checking. Even JJ, the thinnest value bet, makes $133.92 by betting as opposed to $98 from checking (it does not win quite the full pot by checking because it occasionally chops with OOP‚Äôs JJ).
The bluffs are all mixed strategies, which means betting must have the same EV as checking, $0 in this case.
OOP must reach a calling frequency of 50% to make IP indifferent to bluffing (very slightly less here because of the blocking effect from JJ). JJ is a profitable call because it blocks some of IP‚Äôs value bets, the rest are pure bluff-catchers and indifferent between calling and folding.
Although both players have 50% equity, IP‚Äôs EV in this game is $67.70, well over half the $50 pot. This is true despite OOP playing as well as they possibly could. The opportunity to bet a polarized range is inherently valuable, no matter how your opponent responds.
What do you expect to happen if we node lock OP‚Äôs strategy to call at a frequency of 52% rather than 50%? How will IP change their strategy to exploit this slightly too loose calling strategy? Do you expect them to change not at all, to bluff slightly less, or to bluff dramatically less? You can see for yourself in the solution here.
This very small increase in OP‚Äôs calling frequency caused IP to stop bluffing altogether! This is because all those mixed strategies were extremely sensitive to OP‚Äôs response. Notice that none of the pure strategies have changed. TT remains most profitable as a check, because this was not an especially close decision at equilibrium.
If we turn OOP into a huge calling station who calls 100% of the time, that makes TT a value bet for IP, but 99 still plays best as a check.
Even when you choose to exploit an opponent‚Äôs mistakes, it‚Äôs useful to start with an idea of the baseline or GTO strategy. Once you understand which parts of that strategy depend most on your opponent‚Äôs response, you can make more informed and profitable decisions about how to deviate and exploit that response.

Adapting on Early Streets
When you anticipate an opponent making a mistake at a future node, the value of reaching that node with hands that will profit from that mistake increases, and you may be incentivized to play differently on early streets in hopes of profiting from that mistake later.
Suppose you had a read that a certain opponent called too often on the turn. Bluffing less on the turn would seem to be the obvious exploit, but what if they also folded too often on the river? In that case, you might actually be incentivized to bluff more often on the turn in anticipation of growing a pot you expect to steal later.
Similarly, if your opponent who bluffs too often on the river, you should factor that into your turn (and earlier street) decisions. Mostly this will mean calling more turn bets, anticipating extra value from bluff-catching rivers. But if your hand is an especially poor candidate for calling rivers, you are likely better off folding it immediately on the turn, even if it‚Äôs a hand that would be a profitable GTO call. The GTO strategy for such a hand would anticipate more checking and showing down on the river than you expect from this opponent.
These exploits can extend all the way back to pre-flop decisions. The more mistakes you anticipate an opponent making after the flop, the more incentive you have to get into pots with them in order to profit from those mistakes. There‚Äôs a big caveat here, though‚Ä¶

Multiway Pots
Before the flop, or any time there are multiple players with live hands, you are limited in your ability to exploit a specific opponent.
Suppose you know, before the flop, that the player in the BB is a nit who will fold their blind too often to a small raise. If you are UTG at a nine-handed table, you might be able to open very slightly wider than you otherwise would, but you still can‚Äôt get too out of line because of the seven other players who might call or three-bet you.
If the action folded to you on the BTN, you‚Äôd have a lot more leeway to open more hands, as the BB is now the primary constraint on your opening range. Even so, you‚Äôd be somewhat constrained by the threat of three-bets from the SB, especially if they were a savvy player who expected you to open wider against a tight BB.
A similar dynamic can occur after the flop. Suppose UTG opens, you call on the BTN, and the BB calls. UTG is an overly straightforward player who will reliably bet their strong hands and check their weak ones after the flop, but BB is a tough and savvy opponent whom you expect to be aware of UTG‚Äôs mistake and your likely adaptations to it. Should UTG check to you, you would want to bet somewhat more often than a GTO strategy would to take advantage of extra fold equity from UTG, but you should expect BB to call and check-raise you somewhat more often as well. As with the pre-flop example, both you and BB can adapt to exploit UTG‚Äôs mistake without becoming exploitable by one another. It is UTG who could exploit both of you, should they ever get wise and check some strong hands or check-raise some bluffs.
That latter case can best be thought of as a blend of GTO and exploitative dynamics, where both you and the SB are claiming a larger share of the pot by adapting to the BB‚Äôs mistake while trying to remain balanced against one another. This will entail you opening somewhat wider than you otherwise would, the SB calling and three-betting somewhat wider, and you calling or four-betting those three-bets with somewhat weaker hands than you otherwise would. A new equilibrium emerges, with the BB‚Äôs mistake enabling both you and the SB to play more hands without becoming exploitable against one another. The player who could profit from your deviations would be the BB, if they were to wake up to what was going on and increase their own calling, three-betting, and four-betting frequencies.
### TOPIC: important concepts
The 10 Most Important Concepts for New Poker Players
If you don‚Äôt understand some terms in this article, learn more about them in our Poker Glossary.

1. Mechanics of game theory
Fundamentals are one of the most important points when starting out. While many old-school players learned by feel, this style of play rarely works outside of the softest games in today‚Äôs poker economy.
Start by learning the mathematical fundamentals of game theory, such as pot odds, stack-to-pot ratio (SPR)
, equity
, expected value
, Minimum Defense Frequency (MDF)
, and equity realization
. You don‚Äôt need to be a mathematician, and you don‚Äôt need to be calculating at the tables. But you do need a sense of how this game‚Äôs mechanics actually work to become successful.
You need to understand what hand strength (relative to the board texture) is appropriate for what line you‚Äôre taking. Stacking off in a 20 SPR pot with top pair no kicker is seldom warranted. Folding a set just because a two-card straight is possible is almost never going to be correct in a low SPR situation. You need an idea of what is appropriate. How do you develop these senses? Well, start with thresholds!
We have covered fundamental topics in the Daily dose of GTO in November. Read more here.

2. Thresholds
One of the fastest ways to become a reasonably solid poker player is by studying thresholds. Which hand classes are reasonable to stack off with in this spot? What hands can reasonably raise for value? What hand classes need to continue vs. this bet?
Beginners almost always misevaluate these thresholds, commonly by overvaluing medium-strength hands. So the next time you review a GTO solution, go out of your way to find these value and continuation thresholds. It‚Äôs much easier to learn a simple line in the sand than memorize entire ranges.

3. It‚Äôs not about your hand, it‚Äôs about how you play your entire range
Common trap beginners fall into is obsessing over the frequencies of individual hands. The problem with this approach is that it‚Äôs simply impossible to memorize all frequencies for every spot. This is a wildly inefficient method of training.
A much better approach involves taking a step back and looking at things holistically. Look at your entire range. You need to construct something that involves the correct amount of bluffs and value relative to your actions. Even if your frequencies are incorrect, it‚Äôs the overall construction of your range that actually matters. Check out our YouTube channel for examples of how to do this.

4. Winning the pot more often is not the same thing as maximizing EV
The human mind tends to remember losses more strongly than wins. This often causes a bias, tempting people to try and win the pot immediately instead of making the highest EV play. Sometimes the best play involves taking a line that either wins a huge pot and more often than not loses a small pot.
Let‚Äôs say we rolled a dice. If we roll a 1-5 you give me $10. If we roll a 6, I give you $100. 83% of the time you‚Äôll lose $10, but 17% of the time you‚Äôll win $100.
Your EV in this game is extremely high, EV = (‚Öô * $100 ‚Äì ‚Öö * $10) = + $8.33 per roll.
As you can see, winning more often isn‚Äôt necessarily the highest EV play. Sometimes, you need to take a high-EV, low-frequency longshot. Sometimes you need to check vulnerable made hands and let your opponent draw. Retrain your mind to overcome this bias.

5. Stop overvaluing big cards
Most recreational players massively overvalue big cards. As a result, they‚Äôll often play very top-heavy ranges, causing them to make a lot of dominated pairs and run into reverse implied odds situations more often.
In poker, implied odds are everything, especially if you play cash games 100bb deep. The ability to draw to the nuts and withstand multiple streets of aggression often far outweighs the value you can obtain with a dominated top pair. Many beginners are surprised to see that GTO often folds hands like AJo to a 3bet, choosing instead to continue with hands with better implied odds such as suited connectors or pocket pairs.
A typical leak is overplaying big pairs, often well beyond their actual value given the board texture. Part of this is psychological; aces is somehow a magical hand that ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù to get paid off in stacks. The top pair good kicker cannot get outdrawn again. Two-pair is somehow unfoldable despite all the draws getting there and the opponent checking the river. This behavior often limits the value of these premium hands when played by a novice. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs just one pair.

6. Most of your EV comes from nutted hands
Nutted hands make up the majority of your expected value. This becomes truer as you play deeper. The fact is that the *vast* majority of hands are very close to breakeven, so it‚Äôs paramount to learn to play your nutted hands correctly.
Here we can see the expected value of combinations when folded to the BTN in a 100bb cash game. The BTN opens 42% of hands. About half of all hands opened in this spot expect to make less than 0.1bb in the long run.
The same holds true postflop. Most of your expected value is generated by the few nutted hands you have in range. This is why it‚Äôs so important to learn how to play your nutted hands well.

7. Start by mastering your preflop strategy
Mastering preflop is the quickest and most efficient way to improve your results drastically. Playing preflop well translates into playing postflop well. Everything stems from this street. Luckily, preflop solutions are readily available for free, and GTO Wizard offers several training modes to hone your preflop skills.
Make your preflop strategy automatic. This allows you to confidently put in more volume, make fewer mistakes, and sets you up to play well on future streets. Try our GTO Trainer for free!

8. Most of your heuristics are based on lies
Almost every heuristic you‚Äôve ever come up with is inevitably based on biased assumptions. Your perception of a winning play is skewed by the meta in which you play, and subconscious factors like risk aversion will bias your strategy. When you read a solver, your brain will try to rationalize the strategy to fit your own worldview rather than trying to expand your theory. This is very human, and it takes training to overcome.
To truly grow as a poker player, you often need to let go of old habits and broaden your horizons. This is especially true for those new to the world of solvers and game theory optimal play. Try to challenge your assumptions. Go out of your way to look for counterexamples to your theories. The goal is to expand your mind rather than reinforcing your current view.

9. Variance is much bigger than the human mind can conceptualize
The gambler‚Äôs fallacy is very common among poker players. Let‚Äôs say we flip a fair coin, and it lands on heads 6 times in a row. What is the probability that it lands on heads the next flip?
If you‚Äôre superstitious, you might think you are ‚Äúowed‚Äù tails. But that‚Äôs simply not how reality works. The next flip is 50%/50%. You‚Äôre just as likely to flip a 7th heads as you were to flip heads the first time.
After thousands of flips we would expect heads and tails to even out. But that‚Äôs not because of some universal Karma; it‚Äôs simply the law of large numbers. Imagine we flip 1000 times and heads retains the 6-flip lead. At this point, we‚Äôve flipped 503 heads and 497 tails ‚Äì this is actually the expected value when starting with a 6-point lead. At this point, it‚Äôs 50.3% heads, 49.7% tails.
Now imagine we flip 100,000 times and retain the same 6 point lead. Now it‚Äôs 50.0003% heads and 49.9997% tails. The ‚Äúluck‚Äù appears to even out despite tails never catching up. This is the law of large numbers.
Similarly, just because you‚Äôve had bad luck doesn‚Äôt mean you are ‚Äúowed‚Äù any rungood. The deck owes you nothing. Each hand is an independent event without memory of how you got your aces cracked.
The opposite is also true. Just because you‚Äôve run well doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre owed any bad luck. The truth is that variance in poker is far beyond what humans are capable of truly conceptualizing. If you‚Äôve ever played around with a poker variance calculator, you‚Äôd find that it takes tens of thousands of hands before you can see a statistically significant edge materialize. We‚Äôll discuss poker variance calculators more in future articles.

10. Stop overplaying medium-strength hands
One of the most common leaks among weak aggressive players are those that don‚Äôt have a medium-strength showdown value range.
This player type constantly overextends themself and is terrified of getting outdrawn. They have two ranges: the give-up range, and everything else gets the gas pedal.
They never win at showdown with marginal hands because those hands either bet so aggressively that they fold out the opponent, or get to showdown against a narrow range that has them crushed. They have no real trapping range; their passive lines are almost always dominated.
The problem with overplaying medium hands is that you often just end up folding out worse and getting called by better. It‚Äôs a very inefficient way to organize your equity. This style really only works well against calling stations. It‚Äôs easy to exploit.
You don‚Äôt need to keep firing every made hand just because there‚Äôs a draw on the board. Work on developing a medium-strength, ‚Äúshowdown value‚Äù, ‚Äúpot-control‚Äù range.
We also made a video on this theme. You can watch it below:
### TOPIC: initial bettor advantage
The Initial Bettor‚Äôs Advantage
The mathematics of poker holds a little-known secret: the first bettor enjoys better bluffing odds than someone who raises by the same amount. In this article, we‚Äôll explore the calculations behind this phenomenon and discuss how this plays into theoretically optimal strategies.
Let‚Äôs start with an example to illustrate this principle. Blind vs. Blind, Single-raised pot:
The pot is 6 bb
SB bets 3 bb (50% pot-sized bet)
BB raises to 9 bb (50% pot-sized raise)
Let‚Äôs calculate the bluffing odds for both players. This calculation is also known as Alpha, or 1 ‚Äì MDF. You can read more about that here, but to recap:
Breakeven Bluff = Risk / (Risk + Reward)
Where:
Risk is the amount risked with a pure bluff. Or how much you would lose if your bluff fails.
Reward is the amount gained if your opponent folds, compared to if you had given up.
SB needs 3 / (3 + 6) = 33% fold equity to profitably bluff the initial bet.
BB needs 9 / (3 + 6 + 9) = 50% fold equity to profitably bluff-raise the bet.
Both players risked the same fraction of the pot. Therefore, both the bet and the raise lay the same pot odds. Despite that, the initial bet required less fold equity for a bluff to be profitable! We can also consider the inverse calculation, MDF. The Minimum Defense Frequency describes how often players must defend to prevent the opponent from profitably bluffing. SB facing the raise is only required to defend, at most, half their range. BB facing the initial bet is required to defend two-thirds of their range.
However, the pot odds requirements have not changed. In both cases, either player should continue with hands that can claim more than 25% pot share. In summary, facing a raise you don‚Äôt need to defend as wide compared to facing an initial bet of the same size, while at the same time, the equity required to profitably call does not change.
Visualizing This Effect
The following table shows how much extra fold equity you need when raising, compared to if your raise was the initial bet. For example, a 50% bet needs 33.3% fold equity. But a 50% raise over a 30% bet requires 45.83% fold equity, resulting in a required surplus 16% fold equity! Put another way, the half-pot raise over the 30% bet requires your opponent to fold 16% more often before your bluffs break even.
We can see the effect is strongest at the minimum raise size, where you‚Äôd normally get the best price on a bluff. This often ties into block-betting theory ‚Äì but more on that later.
The reason behind this effect is actually fairly intuitive. The initial pot is a prize that incentivizes bluffing and calling. As a series of raises occurs, the size of the initial pot shrinks relative to the ‚Äúreward‚Äù part of our calculation. To make it more intuitive, imagine you‚Äôre facing a 100bb 5bet shove preflop. The initial 1.5bb unopened pot now has little bearing on the risk/reward ratio of this shove. The same concept applies here. As a series of bets and raises fly in, the initial pot which had originally incentivized betting becomes less relevant.
It should be noted that just because you get a slight mathematical advantage when bluffing, that doesn‚Äôt give you a free license to start leading every spot! There are still many spots where you should check range.
Practical Example
Let‚Äôs return to our previous example. SB opens 3, BB calls. Flop‚Äôs J‚ô• 6‚ô¶ 3‚ô£. SB c-bets half-pot, BB raises half-pot, SB calls. Turn is the K‚ô†. BB barrels 75%, SB calls. River is the Q‚ô£.
The Queen of clubs is a decent card for SB here. It turns many of their weak one-pair hands into two pair. For that reason, SB develops a donking strategy
 ‚Äì leading into the aggressor.
The SB called a flop raise and then a big turn bet, so their range is mostly condensed towards made hands with few draws at this point. The BB, however, arrives at this unfortunate river with too many bluffs. This wasn‚Äôt a mistake in their strategy, this is just the nature of Hold‚Äôem. Some runouts favor you; others do not.
We can see by observing the equity distribution that no player really has the nut advantage, but SB has an equity advantage by virtue of not having trash in their range.
The SB therefore donk leads 35% pot representing a range of two pair+ for value, along with some marginal top pair. The following chart displays the donk bet construction:
There are several reasons for this bet. One is to push their middling equity advantage. Another is that, if they had range-checked, BB could check back more to exploit them. But one of the deeper reasons, buried within the mathematics of the game, is that the SB‚Äôs lead grants them favorable bluffing odds compared to check-raising.
Facing this donk bet, the BB has a 48% pot shove behind, which they utilize about ‚Öì of the time. However, despite their raise being bigger than the donk, they are required to bluff less often.
When the BB does shove the last half-pot, SB only needs to defend 50% of their range, as opposed to the 67% that would be required if we had instead checked and faced a half-pot bet.
Summary
When comparing the mathematical consequences of a 50% bet against a 50% raise we see that, unlike pot odds, MDF and Alpha do not scale with pot%. This leads to four key takeaways:
The initial bettor gets a better price on a bluff than a raise of the same size.
You should defend less often facing a raise than an initial bet of the same size.
Facing a raise, the defender has a slight advantage, as they are not obligated to defend as wide (compared to a bet of the same size), but the required pot odds to call haven‚Äôt changed.
This often ties into block-betting theory, especially on the river.
### TOPIC: ip 4bet deep stack
IP 4-Betting in Deep-Stacked Cash Games
4-betting in position (IP) is a totally different phenomenon from 4-betting out of position (OOP). 4-betting reduces the importance of position, either by ending the hand preflop (if the 3-bettor folds or shoves) or by dramatically reducing the amount of money remaining to be wagered after the flop. This makes it a more appealing prospect for OOP, as it promises to mitigate or eliminate entirely their positional disadvantage. By the same token, 4-betting is less appealing for IP, whose favorable position will typically permit them to over-realize their equity as a result of postflop wagering.
Deeper stacks complicate this calculus, as they allow a bit more room for postflop play, even in 4-bet pots (4BP). This article will focus on 200bb flop play in 4-bet pots from the perspective of an IP 4-bettor. To do that, however, we will also have to look at how deeper stacks change the preflop incentives that determine the ranges with which each player will see the flop.
Aggregate Continuation Betting Strategy
The following charts show the frequency with which an IP 4-bettor takes a variety of flop actions across a variety of configurations. What patterns do you notice when comparing the 100bb chart to the 200bb chart?
Here are some key takeaways we‚Äôll explore further below:
IP checks back the flop significantly more often with 200bb stacks than with 100bb stacks. This is true even though their opponent has more incentive to develop a donk-betting range with deeper stacks, a point we‚Äôll explore in greater depth later.
IP checks back the flop more often after 4-betting into BB than after 4-betting into SB. This tendency is more pronounced at 200bb than at 100bb.
IP uses the 50% pot bet size more often at 200bb and the smaller bet sizes less often.
IP is more likely to shove the flop with 100bb, but this is a rarely used option in almost all configurations.
IP‚Äôs average c-bet size is larger when playing against BB than when playing against SB. This is true with both 100bb and 200bb stacks.

Preflop Strategies
To explain these patterns, we must look at how both players‚Äô preflop strategies vary with stack size. The SPR is far from the only thing that changes when we compare 100bb flop scenarios to 200bb flop scenarios.
For one thing, the SPR doesn‚Äôt change as much as you might expect because both players use different preflop raise sizes with 200bb than with 100bb. For OOP, the difference is not enormous, but whether they raise larger or smaller depends on their position‚Äîsitting as the SB or the BB.
Preflop raise sizes (in bb) with 100bb (‚Üñ) and 200bb (‚Üó) stacks
Deeper stacks incentivize a more polar 3-betting range for OOP.

OOP
Hands like medium pocket pairs, a designation which can include pairs as large as QQ, will face tough decisions if the original raiser calls or 4-bets. From the BB, OOP can strictly follow that polarization incentive, as they are contesting the pot only with the original raiser. Thus, with 200bb stacks, they three-bet a more polar range from the BB than with 100bb stacks.
From the SB, their incentives are more complicated. They‚Äôd like to polarize against the original raiser but still have the BB to worry about. As a result, some hands that would prefer not to 3-bet against the original raiser nevertheless raise because they benefit from folding out the BB. This results in a more linear range which includes many hands that will not be favored when called by the raiser. The deeper the stacks, the greater their liability, resulting in a smaller 3-bet size with 200bb stacks than with 100bb.
All that said, these differences are not large, with OOP‚Äôs 3-bet sizing varying by only about 10%. For IP, the difference is much more dramatic.

IP
With 100bb stacks, IP‚Äôs 4-bets are roughly double the 3-bet. With 200bb stacks, they are more like triple the size of the 3-bet. These significantly larger raises offer much less compelling calling odds to OOP. This results in OOP folding more often and showing up with a stronger range when they call.
BB‚Äôs stronger calling range with 200bb stacks flops more equity, on average, leading to more donk-betting and less c-betting.
Continuation Bet Sizing
For our investigation of flop play, we will focus on scenarios where the 4-bettor is on the BTN, as these are the cases where you are most likely to end up playing a 4-bet pot after the flop. Similar considerations will apply to other positions, though, of course, the details will vary.
A lower SPR is the main reason IP prefers smaller bet sizes, on average, with 100bb stacks. In a BB vs BTN 4BP with 100bb, the geometric bet size is about 27% pot, so these small bets still facilitate getting all the money in smoothly by the river if that is what IP chooses to do. In the same scenario with 200bb stacks, the geometric bet size is about 37% pot.
The lower SPR also explains why IP sometimes shoves the flop with 100bb starting but almost never with 200bb. On certain very coordinated flops, IP will flop a lot of hands that have a great deal to benefit from fold equity but are too strong to bet-fold. Some of them, like AK on a JTX or 542 flop, can even get shoves called by hands they dominate!

With 200bb, IP has more room to maneuver. They are less likely to be priced in to call a shove after betting the flop and also less likely to be called by worse if they were to shove. To the extent they do shove, wheel flops are once again among the best candidates, but AKX monotone boards have replaced JTX as the other top contender.

When Not To Continuation Bet
BTN‚Äôs most checked flops when 200bb deep are all medium-to-high connected flops where BB is more likely to flop straights, sets, and two pairs. This is true regardless of whether they are playing against SB or against BB.

These may not be the best spots to study, however, because BTN should not face many checks on these flops in the first place. Both SB and BB donk-bet their entire range on T98 and bet aggressively on these other flops as well.
As a rule, medium flops are worse for betting than low flops, which are worse than high flops. King-high flops are the very best, as the OOP caller has more Ace-x in their calling range than King-x.

As we have seen already, connected flops are the worst for c-betting. This is partly because OOP will flop more straights but also because connected flops are likely to contain medium cards, which are more likely to help OOP.

Of the King-high flops, the one BTN checks most often vs BB is KQ9 monotone. Checking here is not about this being a bad flop; BTN flops more than 55% of the equity and captures nearly 58% of the EV. Rather, it‚Äôs that this is an extremely static board. So, most hands do not strongly prefer betting earlier rather than later streets.
All hands mix bet and check, with even the stone bottom of BTN‚Äôs range, A‚ô£6‚ô£, being profitable as a bet.
Manhattan plot: BTN flop strategy on KQ9m
In fact, many of BTN‚Äôs most-bet hands are among their weakest! This is not a time for checking and giving up when you miss. When BTN checks a weak hand, it‚Äôs with the intention of bluffing later should their opponent keep checking.
This holds true on less favorable textures as well. On J‚ô•5‚ô•5‚ô¶, the BTN flops less than half the equity and has a similar checking frequency but still gets profitable bluffs with their worst hands:
Manhattan plot: BTN flop strategy on J55tt
Even on Q95r, where BTN has less than 44% equity, they bet often, including with their worst hands:
Manhattan plot: BTN flop strategy on Q95r
Unlike an OOP 4-bettor, an IP 4-bettor does generally get profitable bluffs, even on bad flops. That doesn‚Äôt mean you have to bet the flop, but you should bluff at some point if your opponent keeps checking. The best hands for checking the flop are generally not your lowest equity hands but rather the middle of your range, the sort that would suffer the most from facing a check/raise.

Responding to Donk-Bets
Donk-betting is a significant part of OOP‚Äôs strategy in 4-bet pots. This is especially true when deep-stacked and playing from the BB, because of how much strength that BB calling range contains. On average, they donk about ‚Öì of their range, with most of that betting occurring on their best 25% or so flops. The aforementioned medium, connected flops are strong candidates for range-betting and sometimes even open-shoving more than twice the pot!
BB‚Äôs aggregate first-in flop strategy vs BTN on flops sorted by least checked
BTN‚Äôs response to a shove on T98r is mostly intuitive, though the mixes with AKs (only when it has a backdoor flush draw) and AQo may be a bit surprising. The incentive for these calls comes largely from the fact that AJ is among BB‚Äôs most appealing shoves.
BTN response vs BB‚Äôs donk-shove (212% pot) on T98r
Your response to a smaller donk-bet should be quite stubborn. Across all flops, BTN has an average fold frequency of ~17% vs BB‚Äôs quarter-pot donk-bets, a frequency slightly below MDF.
BTN‚Äôs aggregate response vs BB‚Äôs 25% pot donk on flops grouped by high cards
Note that raising is an important part of IP‚Äôs response as well, especially on boards that favor them. High card boards get mostly small raises, while the rare 5-high and 4-high flops are good candidates for shoving. Most of these boards will give overcards and at least a backdoor wheel draw to all the Ace-x in IP‚Äôs range, which means they wouldn‚Äôt have many good candidates for folding after making a small raise.
On the much less favorable T98r flop, BTN never raises a quarter-pot bet and folds at a higher frequency than MDF, which is why BB can range-donk.
BTN‚Äôs response vs BB‚Äôs 25% pot donk on T98r
On a more neutral J55tt, donking is not a big part of BB‚Äôs strategy, but should BTN face such a bet, they raise a wide and fairly polar range. The best candidates are AA and KK, which unblock top pair, and A‚ô•K‚ô•, which has solid equity against top pair and can get action from dominated flush draws. At the low end, weaker overcards with a single heart are popular candidates, though even some overcards without hearts get mixed in at a lower clip.

Much of the incentive for the raising range comes from the dynamism of the board. Aces and Kings would like to raise into a Jack immediately, lest they lose action when a heart or overcard turns.
On the more static A‚ô•Q‚ô•9‚ô¶ board (staticness here refers more to the rank of the cards on the flop than to the number of draws, especially when the SPR is low), BB donks about half their range, but BTN never raises. Instead, they call more than MDF:
BTN‚Äôs response vs BB‚Äôs 25% pot donk on AQ9tt
Ranges are narrow enough in a 4-bet pot that calling 84% of their range doesn‚Äôt require much stubbornness on BTN‚Äôs part. Backdoor diamonds and Jacks without a heart are pure folds. BTN simply has a pair of Queens or better so often on this flop, they don‚Äôt need to continue with much else. And when they do have those hands, there‚Äôs not much to gain from raising them.

Conclusion
Making sense of postflop play requires understanding preflop ranges and incentives. An OOP 3-bettor has different incentives than an IP 3-bettor, and different incentives depending on the stack depth as well. The BB is incentivized to 3-bet a more polar range than the SB, which influences how IP responds to the 3-bet, which in turn influences OOP‚Äôs range when they call a 4-bet and see a flop.
The higher SPR and stronger OOP range lead to more checking and larger, more polar c-betting from IP. It also leads to more donk-betting, especially from the BB.
Because IP‚Äôs 4-betting range is so clustered around Ace-x and King-x, they perform better on high card flops. This usually but not always leads to more aggression, whether facing a check or a small donk-bet, with the dynamism of the board being a major determinant of how aggressive they get.
Unlike OOP, an IP 4-bettor does generally get profitable bluffs, even on unfavorable flops. They don‚Äôt always bet their worst hands on the flop, but they do bet them eventually if their opponent keeps checking.

Flop Heuristics: IP C-Betting in Cash Games
Our never-ending quest for money and fame leads us to the flop. We open the button, the big blind calls and the dealer throws out three community cards. After a twenty second tank
on KT3r, action is kindly checked over to us. Now what?
This article will look at various IP C-Betting strategies against a BB caller. We‚Äôll learn which factors affect our frequency and bet sizing, and examine a few flops along the way.

Understanding Ranges
Having a solid understanding of how preflop ranges connect with different boards is crucial in building effective postflop strategies. So, what should our first steps be when analyzing how our, and our opponent‚Äôs range, connect with a flop?
Quoting directly from Andrew Brokos‚Äô article Flop Heuristics: IP C-Betting in MTTs‚Äô, He states that when acting as the preflop raiser, rather than focusing on the question ‚ÄúWhich of us is more likely to hit this flop, me or my opponent?‚Äù we should instead ask ourselves ‚ÄúHow does this flop improve my opponent?‚Äù
This small yet important distinction fosters the right mindset as the preflop aggressor. Not only has our opponent declined to 3-bet preflop, leading to them missing many of the strong hands at the top of their range, but their range is wide as well because of the blinds. The combination of these two factors means that we will have an advantage over our opponent on nearly every board, even scary ones!
The tighter the position you open from, the larger your advantage over the blinds will be.

Understanding Textures
Poker is home to a wide variety of flops, 1755 strategically distinct ones to be exact! Even for experienced players, this number is overwhelming. GTO Wizard‚Äôs aggregate reports make this more manageable by allowing us to categorize flops and look for common patterns.
Grouping Flops
Let‚Äôs use GTO Wizard‚Äôs flop grouping tool! For this analysis, we‚Äôll use the most common postflop formation, BTN vs. BB. The following chart shows the BTN C-Betting frequency on different boards grouped by high card. Note that this is a Simple solution, meaning that BB is not allowed to donk
Watch out!
Something that quickly pops out is that 2 high flops are bet the most. Do not be fooled! This is not because the 2 is necessarily good for us, but instead, because the only possible 2 high flop is 222, which is good for us. It‚Äôs similarly impossible to have a 3 high flop without the board being paired at least once. Ace-high flops are most likely to occur, followed by King-high flops and so on.
Why are high cards bet more?
As the preflop raiser, we are more likely to open hands that contain high cards like an Ace, King, or Queen. Conversely, we play fewer hands with low cards, such as 5 or 6. While the BB also prefers to hold higher cards, a large portion of their range consists of low card holdings because of the preflop discount posed by the blinds.
We connect better with high card boards and get to bet more.
A Surprising Discovery
Looking once again at the grouping by high cards chart, we see that Ace High flops are seemingly bet less often than 8 through King-high flops.
Why is this?
The answer comes down to several factors:
The Decreased Value of Fold Equity
On a K73 or Q73 board, there is an incentive to bet a marginal top pair holding (e.g. K8, Q9) to protect or gain value from our opponents‚Äô overcards. However, on an Ace-high board, there is no need for AceX to protect against overcards; anything that isn‚Äôt a draw is nearly dead. This lack of urgency causes hands like marginal AceX ‚Äì which can often only get one or two streets anyway ‚Äì to delay to the turn or river in hopes of seeing a safe runout.
Additionally, the big blind has a large amount of AceX in range as well, causing bets with hands like KK and QQ to cut equity much quicker.
The Ace Polarizes the BB‚Äôs range
On an Ace-High board, the big blind often lacks middling hands; they connect or completely miss. This polarity causes a proportionally large amount of continues as a check-raise as opposed to a check-call. This can be problematic for IP, because OOP often uses a large check-raise size with 2-pair+ and bluffs. This check-raise will often cause even IP‚Äôs strong Top pair to become immediately indifferent on the flop.
Let‚Äôs now put knowledge to work on an Ace-high flop.
A73 Rainbow: A Case Study
Rather than always looking at bets, another great way to analyze a flop is by looking at checks.
Top Pair Weak-kicker AceX and KK‚ÄìJJ all check back the flop at a significantly higher frequency than the rest of the range. These types of hands have low incentive to bet the flop as it is unlikely they‚Äôll get outdrawn. Betting too often with this hand class leaves IP vulnerable to check-raises, which will happen increasingly often as IP chooses to bet more of these marginal holdings.
KingX with a good kicker is another commonly checked hand class. To understand this, think about what betting a hand like KJ accomplishes. Most hands that will fold, like K8 or JT, already have very little equity against KJ. You then also won‚Äôt be able to get value from these hands on a turned King or a Jack. Betting will also increase the proportion of strong hands like AJ and KQ in range in OOP‚Äôs range, weakening your outs.
Let‚Äôs examine BB‚Äôs response to a flop C-Bet.
OOP only ever uses a large raise sizing on this flop consisting of 2-pair+ for value. Most of the bluffs consist of straight draws and weak board pairs.
Facing the raise, hands as strong as AQ are made indifferent. Hilariously enough, strong pocket pairs often prefer calling over AceX as they have more outs to improve and cooler OOP‚Äôs tight value range.
Flop Pairing
Paired flops are bet significantly more often than unpaired flops. However, they tend to only be bet for small sizing. This is mostly due to our preflop equity advantage but reduced nut advantage from trips being in both player‚Äôs ranges. On paired boards, it‚Äôs also much harder to have a draw. This makes it very hard to continue and realize equity against a small bet. The higher the pair and the more disconnected the board is, the larger our advantage and betting frequency as the preflop aggressor will be.
Flop Connectivity
GTO Wizard classifies a flop as connected if it allows for the possibility of a flopped straight.
Disconnected
Disconnected boards are the hardest for either player to connect with. This preserves IP‚Äôs preflop advantage better than other board types. This texture sees the frequent use of the 33% sizing, but the 130% sizing is common as well.
OESD possible
What classifies as a strong hand on an OESD
possible board (Open-Ended Straight Draw) is likely to change on later streets, so sizing up for additional fold equity and protection on the flop can be a good play. This board texture sees the increased use of the 66% pot bet size, but decreased overall betting frequency due to our newfound polarity.
Connected
Connected boards are a unique case due to flopped straights often being in the BB‚Äôs range. In order to be respectful of this, we size down; Connected boards see the least amount of the 133% pot sizing.
Flop Suits
Suited flops follow a similar trend to connected flops. Rainbow flops, being the hardest for either player to connect with, are bet most frequently. Flush draw flops see a decrease in overall betting frequency but a slight increase in polarity. Finally, monotone boards see a DRASTIC decrease in betting frequency and sizing.
Monotone Boards: An Overview
Monotone boards significantly hinder the nut advantage of the IP player. We can see this by sorting by EV.
This is due to all the flushes within our opponent‚Äôs range jumping ahead of our strong preflop hands; but there are some additional factors that lower the flop betting frequency.
On Monotone flops, holding a flush blocks the opponent‚Äôs calling range:
On a K‚ô•9‚ô•5‚ô•, holding A‚ô•T‚ô• will block a significant amount of the opponent‚Äôs continuation range, making it harder to get value. Because of the flush on board, the opponent will no longer be able to defend hands like JT and QT without a heart. Facing a double barrel, the opponent will begin to fold hands as strong as top pair without a heart!
This explains the very low flop check-raise frequency relative to other board textures. The primary hand that wants to raise for value is a flush which blocks the calling range!
Checkraise frequency against ‚Öì pot bet by flop suits.
Furthermore, betting doesn‚Äôt necessarily gain you protection from the various flush draws. A good player will not fold a heart on K‚ô•9‚ô•5‚ô• to a small bet, and sizing up serves to only serves to quickly isolate yourself against the top of your opponent‚Äôs range.
Low flushes are vulnerable to a fourth heart
It‚Äôs often very reasonable to check back a low flush on the flop. While definitely strong enough for 3 streets on a clean runout, not all runouts will be clean.
The primary hand that wants to get value by raising is a flush, and the flush blocks the calling range! This also helps us make sense of strategies on later streets as well. IP often has a hard time sizing up on the turn due to the sheer amount of flushes left in OOP‚Äôs range.
A common low flush strategy is checking back the flop, betting something around half pot on the turn, and then 2x potting the river once a clean runout has been confirmed.
Double high card flushes can also make reasonable flop check backs because they block so much of the continuing range.
High and low card flushes (A2‚ô†, K6‚ô†) often make for the best bets. They don‚Äôt block as many calls and need not wait for a safe runout because they maintain their strength, even on a 4th heart.

Conclusion
Let‚Äôs recap some key points about continuation betting in single-raised pots.
C-Bet more on high card flops that maintain your advantage as the preflop aggressor.
C-Bet more on paired and disconnected flops.
Polarize with larger and less frequent bets on flops where draws are present but not yet completed.
Size down and bet less on flops that complete straights and flushes in your opponent‚Äôs range.

### TOPIC: larger than geometric bet sizing
Why So Much? An Exploration of Larger-Than-Geometric Bet Sizing
Via toy games, it is easy to demonstrate that a player betting a perfectly polarized range maximizes their EV by using geometric bet sizing. That means they choose a percentage of the pot such that if they bet that percentage at each remaining opportunity, their final bet will be all-in.
Real poker games are more complicated, though. Hands change value from street to street, which complicates the idea of polar betting in several important ways:
It‚Äôs possible to gain EV even when your opponent folds hands weaker than yours. This provides an incentive to bet for thin value/protection with hands that will not be big favorites when called but which also gain value from folds.
The equity of some hands depends heavily on the opponent‚Äôs calling range. Thinner value bets, for example, usually perform well against weaker hands but may be in very bad shape against the strongest possible holdings.
Hands that may improve to the point where they can make big value-bets (or bluffs, in the case of certain blockers) have additional incentive to bet earlier streets.
On early streets, you cannot reliably predict whether a hand will be a good value-betting or bluffing candidate by the river.
This is why we tend not to see a lot of geometric betting from solvers on early streets.
Before the flop ‚Äì No (Texas Hold ‚Äòem) hand is a lock against any other hand.
On the flop ‚Äì The above is still a rare phenomenon.
By the turn ‚Äì It‚Äôs quite possible to be in an unbeatable state.
And on the river ‚Äì A hand always has either 100% or 0% equity against a given hand (or, very occasionally, 50% in the case of a chop).
As a result, even when one player has a substantial nuts advantage, we can understand one of the solver‚Äôs strategic tendencies:
A poker solver typically recommends smaller-than-geometric bet sizes on the flop, followed by much larger, often geometric sizing on the turn.
For the player last to act on the river, it is quite common for the solver to recommend only the geometric bet size (all-in, as this is the final betting opportunity), even if that means betting several times the pot.
The smaller bets on early streets accommodate wider, more linear ranges, making it profitable to bet weaker hands for thin value, protection, and board coverage. Very strong hands that would like to put more money in the pot may still benefit if that small bet induces a check-raise, and if not, they will still have two opportunities to make up the difference with big bets on later streets.
Though less common, there are also spots where solvers recommend larger-than-geometric bet sizes on early streets. This can be surprising, as geometric bet sizing maximizes the net amount of money your opponent is incentivized to put into the pot across the remaining streets. Why would very strong hands not want to do this?
We can start building our intuition with a simple example where solvers recommend larger-than-geometric (AKA hypergeometric) sizing: preflop and flop shoves.

Big Preflop Shoves
Here‚Äôs the solver‚Äôs Chip EV strategy when the action folds to the SB with 25bb in an MTT:
SB‚Äôs preflop opening strategy: 25bb effective, MTT Chip EV
The hands in dark red are shoved for 25bb into a 2.5bb pot. What do they have in common? With a few rare exceptions, they are quite strong; it‚Äôs unlikely the one player remaining to act even has an Ace, let alone a pair. Despite being well-above-average hands, they play well as shoves because they benefit from fold equity‚Äîeven BB‚Äôs worst hands typically have 35‚Äì45% equity against them‚Äîand they will be tough to play on later streets. Unlike with stronger hands like 99 or AQo, taking the pot down immediately is a welcome result, but even when called, these hands still have fine equity and may even be small favorites.
Such shoves occur more frequently in MTTs because of the antes and shallower stacks, but they can also make sense in cash games. Here is CO‚Äôs response to a BTN 3-bet with 100bb in a 6-max cash game:
CO response vs BTN‚Äôs 3-bet: 100bb effective, 6-max cash game
Now, we‚Äôre talking about risking 100bb against a stronger (3-betting) range. Even though the circumstances changed, the types of hands that fancy shoving are similar: vulnerable pocket pairs (JJ, but not AA) and offsuit Ace-x (AKo, but not AKs).

Shoving the Flop
These big shoves are less common after the flop has been dealt, but they can arise. Below is BB‚Äôs flop strategy vs BTN in a 100bb cash game 3-bet pot:
BB‚Äôs c-bet flop strategy on JT8tt vs BTN: 100bb effective, 3-bet pot
Most of their bets are shoves for 328% pot! As in our other examples, it is not their very strongest hands that make this play. Rather, it is primarily strong one pair hands and draws with 50‚Äì70% equity, hands that have a reasonable chance of winning when called but also stand to gain a lot from folds.
This is a very specific situation where equities run close together. BB‚Äôs aggregate c-betting strategy across all flops uses this shove just 0.2% of the time. However, as you can see, it can be a significant (28.4%) part of the strategy on one of these rare flops, where it is valuable.
Incidentally, this is why Omaha
is usually played pot limit rather than no limit. There are far more scenarios like this where equities run close together, and the game is significantly less fun and interesting when players can simply shove all-in to avoid playing later streets.

Not Geometric, Not All-In
Now that we have some intuition around why some strong hands might wish to bet hypergeometrically, let‚Äôs examine some trickier cases where that kind of bet is not all-in.
In a 100bb single-raised MTT pot between BB and BTN, geometric sizing would be 110.4%. Yet there are some flops where the presolved sims use 150% as their most common c-bet size, despite 100% being a much closer approximation of the geometric sizing:
BTN‚Äôs c-bet flop aggregate report (sorted by ‚ÄúBet 150%‚Äù) vs BB: in a 100bb MTT SRP
Example: 742r
Presolved sim options & preference:
‚òê 1-street geometric sizing (all-in for 1602%)
‚òë A larger-than-geometric size of 150% pot
‚òê A smaller-than-geometric size of 100% pot
‚òê 66% pot
‚òê 33% pot
Custom-solved sim options & preference:
‚òê 1-street geometric sizing (all-in for 1602%)
‚òë 2-street geometric sizing (238%)
‚òê 3-street geometric sizing (110%)
‚òê An intermediate size of 150% pot
As with the preflop shoves we examined earlier, many of BTN‚Äôs strongest hands are vulnerable and will be difficult to play on later streets. This includes top pair and weak overpairs. These hands are currently strong enough to put stacks in, but they do not want to spread the betting smoothly across three streets, as they‚Äôll lose value as more cards come down. So, they prefer to frontload their value by betting disproportionately much on the flop.
BTN c-bet flop strategy on 742r vs BB: 100bb effective, SRP
A huge bet with 88 gets more value from top or middle pair than it‚Äôs likely to get on later streets should overcards show up on the board, and it folds out more of the live overcards in BB‚Äôs range than a smaller bet would (BB calls a lot more overcard and backdoor flush draw combos to a 110% pot bet).

Barreling the Turn
It appears BTN‚Äôs large flop bet is setting up to shove the turn. In reality, however, I could not find a turn card where the solver gives BTN a shoving range! After betting 238% pot on the flop, BTN almost always checks or bets 70% pot (geometric for the remaining two streets) on the turn. What‚Äôs going on here? Why the rush to shovel money in on the flop, just to pump the brakes on the turn?
Much of what the flop overbet was aiming to accomplish was already accomplished on the flop. When BTN bets 238% pot on the flop, BB folds most of the unpaired overcard hands and even some of the straight draws that could have drawn out. And with just one card to come, BB‚Äôs prospects of drawing out are much diminished.
To the extent these floats are still in BB‚Äôs range, they either improved on the turn and would not fold even to a shove, or they did not and will fold even to a smaller bet. So, the more polar part of BTN‚Äôs range accomplishes its objectives best with geometric betting‚Äîjust as in a toy game‚Äîand, unlike on the flop, the more linear part of their range can deny most of the equity it wants to deny with a smaller turn bet.

A Cash Game Example
In a 100bb single-raised cash game pot between BTN and BB, geometric sizing would be 115.8%, a bit larger than in the MTT example (where antes inflated the pot). The presolved sims offer 75% and 125% as their larger non-all-in sizes, making the latter the closest option to geometric. There are a fair number of flops where BTN uses 125% pot almost exclusively when they bet:
BTN‚Äôs c-bet flop aggregate report (sorted by ‚ÄúBet 125%‚Äù) vs BB: in a 100bb cash SRP
As with our MTT example, in a custom sim where BTN is allowed to use even larger sizes on the AK6r flop (the presolved flop where they use 125% pot most often), they mostly prefer to do so:
BTN‚Äôs c-bet flop strategy on AK6r vs BB: custom-solved sim
You may have noticed that the flops on which BTN uses large c-bets in a 100bb cash game are often not the same low card flops on which they preferred large c-bets in our 100bb tournament example. In fact, BTN in this example exclusively prefers smaller bets on 742r, the flop on which the MTT BTN used big bets most often.
The cash game BTN still has all those weaker overpairs and many of the top pair hands that benefited from shoveling money into the pot in the MTT example. The difference lies in the cash game BB‚Äôs range, which‚Äîwithout antes to subsidize the preflop call‚Äîcontains far less 7-x, 4-x, and 2-x from which those hands could get big value.
Of course, there are no unpaired overcards in BB‚Äôs range on AK6r as there were on 742r. Instead, the hands being denied equity by the larger-than-geometric c-bet now are underpairs, gutshots, and even some top pair:
BB response vs BTN‚Äôs 200% pot flop c-bet
BTN‚Äôs bluffs obviously benefit from this additional fold equity, but why does AK care about folding hands with 2‚Äì4 outs?
We often use the expression ‚Äúdenying equity,‚Äù but it would be more accurate to say this bet denies EV to those hands. Sure, QT isn‚Äôt likely to drill that gutshot on the turn, but when it does, AK is going to lose a big pot. So, pushing BTN off that draw denies them not just the ~8% chance of completing the draw but all the money they would win as a result of that miracle turn.

A Turn Example
The hand that inspired this article began as a BB vs BTN single-raised MTT pot, 50bb deep. BTN c-bet 33% pot on a Q‚ô†J‚ô•2‚ô¶ flop (the solver strategy is essentially to range-bet small) and BB called. After BB checks a 6‚ô£ turn, geometric sizing would be 108.5%, yet the solver recommends betting 200% pot with a significant chunk of BTN‚Äôs range:
BTN turn barrel strategy on QJ26r vs BB: 50bb effective, SRP
Now that we‚Äôve familiarized ourselves with larger-than-geometric bets, we can make sense of what‚Äôs going on here. The small bet on the flop incentivized BB to call with many marginal hands, and also to raise their strongest hands. On a blank turn, BB will hold a mostly capped range with many relatively weak hands that nevertheless have good equity against BTN‚Äôs wide flop betting range. Those are the range dynamics that typically lead to polar, geometric betting on the turn.
The straight draws are what motivate the extra large bet, as they are the most dynamic hands in BB‚Äôs range. Unlike BB‚Äôs rather static bluff catcher-type hands, these draws will over-realize their equity on the river, often winning big pots when they improve and getting away cheaply when they miss. Whatever value BTN is going to get from them, they need to get before the river.
And there is value to be gotten from them. BB‚Äôs weaker straight draws fold, which, as we discussed above, is disproportionately valuable in its own right. But KT and AT mostly call 200% pot on the turn, the latter in no small part because it dominates all the KT in BTN‚Äôs range.
Why Don‚Äôt We See This More Often?
Lots of boards have straight draws on them, but these larger-than-geometric bets are not so common. What is it about these spots that make such large bets optimal?
This is hard to verify, but I suspect that, in addition to the incentives discussed above, the range dynamics are such that BTN can profitably put this much money into the pot and still incentivize BB to call with bluff-catchers. The danger of big bets is that when your opponent has many strong hands in their range, they can just call with those and fold everything else, and your bluffs still won‚Äôt show a profit because they lose so much when called. It‚Äôs important that, in these spots, BTN has a significant advantage at the top end of the ranges.
Here is the equity distribution graph for the turn spot we‚Äôve been investigating. Notice that BB has more equity for the weakest 67% of the ranges, but at the top end, BTN overtakes them.
Turn equity distribution graph QJ26r
I think it is not coincidental that BB‚Äôs folding frequency to the 200% pot turn bet is approximately 67%. In other words, the function of this bet is to push BB off the part of the range where they have the advantage, forcing them to defend at the high end where BTN has the stronger hands.
BB‚Äôs calls come entirely from the top end of their range, with one notable exception: KT.

Conclusion
In toy games where hands do not change value, geometric betting is the most efficient way to extract value with nutted hands. These toy games can serve as reasonable proxies for real poker situations, especially on later streets when hand values tend to become more and more static.
On Early Streets
When strong hands are in danger of losing value on later streets, however, whether as a result of new cards or the opponent‚Äôs bets or some combination of the two, they sometimes have incentive to frontload their value with larger-than-geometric bets. We see this most commonly before the flop, when hand values, on average, run closest together and big shoves can deny your opponent‚Äôs equity while guaranteeing you will realize 100% of your own equity.
On Later Streets
Even on later streets, however, such large bets may make sense to extract value from draws before they have the opportunity to make easy decisions on the river. That doesn‚Äôt have to mean shoving, as you‚Äôd still prefer to cut losses with the bluffs in your range and give tough decisions to your opponent‚Äôs medium-strength hands, but it may mean larger-than-geometric bets.

### TOPIC: leading hands that check call
Leading Hands That Should Check-Call
The most consistent leak I have encountered live and online, and at a variety of stakes, is when an out of position (OOP) player leads into the preflop aggressor (PFA) with middle pair-type hands. The sort of hands that should really be check/calling. This occurs on boards where leading is usually not a thing. Many years ago, this action was mostly taken by players who flopped a very strong hand like a set and wanted to take the betting lead, but nowadays, it is consistently associated with medium-strength hands, at least in my experience.
So, for example, we‚Äôre playing a $1/$2 game. UTG has opened, the BB has called, the flop is AT2r and the BB leads out for $6 with what eventually turns out to be T9o.
This seems like an illogical strategy for the BB for a number of reasons:
This is a board that heavily favors the UTG opener.
This strategy makes it easier for the opponent to play perfectly, as the range is clearly defined (if the assumption is correct). They can fold everything that doesn‚Äôt beat a pair of tens and only continue with hands that crush the BB or get the right price to draw to hands that can easily pull ahead, of which they have many.
It also leaves the BB open to exploitation, especially getting bluff-raised.
It appears that this kind of bet is designed for pot control. The BB‚Äôs holding has good showdown value and the lead is setting a price that they‚Äôre willing to pay to get to showdown. They are betting an amount they want to call, rather than turning their hand into a bluff-catcher and having to pay UTG‚Äôs price. In the early days of poker, players would often ‚Äòbet (or raise) to see where they‚Äôre at.‚Äô In this case, by leading out and if they faced a raise, they ‚Äúknew‚Äù they were behind.
My intuitive take on how to deal with this misconceived strategy of leading for this reason was to:
Bluff-raise them a lot
Call when I had a strong hand to try and elicit more bets on the turn and river, not wanting to blast them off the pot
And also call with any draw
In a nutshell, I would string them along when I had it, bluff them when I didn‚Äôt.
Let‚Äôs test this intuition with GTO Wizard AI and its nodelocking feature.

Board Without Leading
This is an NL50 example: UTG has opened, the BB has called, and the flop is J‚ô†6‚ô¶5‚ô¶. First, the GTO solution.
This is always a check from the BB. When they do check, this is what UTG follows up with:
UTG c-bet flop strategy vs BB on J65tt: GTO
‚Üí A mixed strategy with mostly medium-sized betting.
BB Leads
Now let‚Äôs use GTO Wizard AI‚Äôs nodelocking feature and make it so that the BB leads when they have a pair worse than top pair, and we will give it a few bluffs with draws too. (We are not making them completely unbalanced; we are making them lead with the worst type of value):
BB‚Äôs (nodelocked) donk-bet flop strategy vs UTG on J65tt: Exploitative
We have nothing in GTO world to compare it to, so let‚Äôs look at the response to the lead:
UTG‚Äôs response vs BB‚Äôs donk-bet flop strategy: Exploitative
The response is stark. We raise 100% of the time, going all-in 39% of the time. Remember, these are 100bb starting stacks. The BB has capped their range, so the natural exploit is to put them under heavy pressure by raising, often for all of it. Even hands we would want to ‚Äòmilk‚Äô our opponent with like JJ raise here.
The shoving range is very polarized, it is mostly top pair-type hands and Ace-x for a bluff. The sets all bet smaller because they want to keep their opponent in the pot.
BB Checks
Up next is the response when the BB checks instead. We know that, in theory, they are checking most of their middle pairs, but also their top pair or better hands:
Node comparison: UTG responses vs BB flop check (left = exploitative, right = GTO)
UTG bets less often in the nodelocked example and uses the smallest sizing (whereas a bigger sizing was used at equilibrium). This is because the BB has a much more polarized checking range; they either have a very strong hand or trash, nothing in the middle. This is a common strategy for dealing with polarized ranges: to bet small. The BB‚Äôs strongest hands want to put more money in and will be inclined to raise the small bet. The BB‚Äôs weakest hands will be forced to bluff or fold.
This is the GTO response to the 33% pot bet:
BB response vs UTG‚Äôs 33% pot c-bet: GTO
And this is the response in nodelocked world:
BB response vs UTG‚Äôs 33% pot c-bet: Exploitative
In nodelocked world, the BB has to fold 10% more often because there is so much more trash, relatively, in the range.
This is common when nodelocking: often, there is also a significant adjustment on the part of the game tree where the mistake is not explicitly being made but gets implicitly affected by it. There are fewer made hands in the BB‚Äôs checking range because so many of them were lead, so they have to fold more often to aggression.

Board With Leading
Let‚Äôs now look at a spot where there should be some leading from the BB, so we can compare a GTO response to a lead with the exploitative response when there are too many middling hands in that range. The conditions are the same, but this time the flop is 6‚ô•5‚ô†2‚ô•.
This is the first action at equilibrium:
BB donk-bet flop strategy vs UTG on 652tt: GTO
The BB has the four suited straights and all the sets at full weight on this flop, UTG does not, which means BB can lead ~11% of the time. This includes middle pair-type hands. Not only are there leads with hands like 5‚ô•4‚ô•, which is middle pair+gutshot+flush draw, there are also leads with hands like Q‚ô¶5‚ô¶, which are simply middle pair. In this instance, a bet with middle pair is not an attempt to get to showdown cheaply; it is a value-bet. Because the BB leads with nutted hands (e.g., sets and straights), it means they can also go for thin value (e.g., small pairs). The bet is also to prevent check-backs, as the hand is very vulnerable to every turn card above a 6 (and as we will see in a moment, there are a lot of check-backs in UTG‚Äôs range), so we don‚Äôt want to give UTG a free card.
In response to the lead, this is what UTG does:
UTG response vs BB‚Äôs donk-bet 33% pot on 652tt: GTO
Not many hands fold, but not many hands raise either; UTG mostly calls. This includes many hands that ‚Äòpairs-worse-than-top-pair‚Äô beat, like Ace- and King-high, so that our bets with 5-x indeed generate enough value to be profitable.
If we nodelock similarly to our first example by having the BB lead with just middling pairs, no strong hands, then we will get the same result as the first example. The problem with that strategy was that the BB had a capped range, not that they were leading.
Nodelock#1
So instead, let‚Äôs assume the BB is a thinking player who knows this is a good board for occasional leads. However, let‚Äôs marginally increase the frequency that they lead with second and third pair, but keep the rest of the range the same. This is a smart player, who leads slightly too much with medium-strength hands:
BB donk-bet flop strategy vs UTG on 652tt: Exploitative
The range almost looks the same, and as you can see, the leading frequency has only increased by 1.7%. The nutted hands and bluffs are still in there, we just lead our 5-x and 2-x a little more often.
This is the UTG‚Äôs new response to the nodelocked lead:
UTG response vs BB‚Äôs donk-bet 33% pot on 652tt: Exploitative
UTG folds a little more, as the leading range is more value-heavy, but they also significantly increase the raising range. UTG raises almost three times as often, despite the BB only marginally changing their leading frequency! The types of hands that raise are the same, they just do so more often. It may not be as dramatic as in the first example, but the response appears to be universal.
When a player leads out with too many medium-strength hands, the exploit is to raise them.
Raising even with high-equity hands, contrary to the intuition of some players (including myself) that they perform better as slow plays.
In GTO world, this is the response to the raise:
BB response vs UTG‚Äôs 55% raise (vs BB‚Äôs 33% donk): GTO
And this is the response in the nodelocked example:
BB response vs UTG‚Äôs 55% pot raise (vs BB‚Äôs 33% pot donk): Exploitative
Not significantly different; in fact, the BB continues more often overall in the nodelocked example because UTG has a wider raising range.
This, however, is a GTO response from the BB. As we have seen in another article, after nodelocking, the solver will adjust and play as close to GTO as possible. In reality, we know that our opponent is not playing perfectly. This particular leak may be compounded by the fact that this sort of player may also over-fold to a raise. In their mind, the lead was a way to ask the question, ‚ÄúDoes my opponent have a hand?‚Äù And a raise would be equivalent to answering with ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
Nodelock#2
So, let‚Äôs do a 2nd nodelock and have the BB fold all the 5-x and 2-x that do not also have a draw alongside it or a strong kicker.
BB‚Äôs nodelocked response vs UTG‚Äôs 55% pot raise: Exploitative
Only an extra 2.7% of hands in the overall range fold. Let‚Äôs see what that does to the response to the original lead by the BB:
UTG response vs (over-folding) BB who donk-bet 33% pot: Exploitative
UTG has gone from raising the lead 28.3% of the time to raising it 54.6% of the time (recall it was just 10% of the time at equilibrium). I could keep going, but it only took me folding a few more hands for this to become a 100% raise range!
This is devastating for the BB. The exploit against a player leading too condensed is to raise. When they over-fold on top of that leak, the max EV response is simply to raise even more.

Conclusion
The universal response to leading too condensed is to raise more often, especially when the player has a secondary leak of folding too much to the raise.
The instinct might be to flat-call with strong hands, to avoid blasting these players out of the pot, which is what I used to do. However, the solver also raises their nutted hands most of the time. They still want to build a pot, and that‚Äôs more likely to happen when it is clear the opponent has a hand that can put more chips into the pot than if they were weighted toward bluffs.
A player with this kind of leak is trying to keep the pot manageable. They are also asking the question, ‚ÄúDoes my opponent have a better hand?‚Äù
The logical response, therefore, is not to allow them to manage the pot and to give them an answer they do not like.
### TOPIC: loose passive limpers
How to Handle Loose-Passive Limpers
Solver charts and presolved solutions do not offer much in the way of explicit guidance for responding to limpers. This is because players are generally not incentivized to limp from any position save the SB, and even when they are, the ranges with which a solver would limp are quite different from those employed by recreational players and sometimes even professionals who didn‚Äôt study these spots.
With the help of custom solutions, however, we can actually investigate how a solver would play after the flop against a limp-caller. And we can dispel some common misconceptions along the way.
What Do Limp-Calling Ranges Look Like?
More than most spots, limp-calling ranges depend heavily on the player. A player who limps and calls a raise is almost certainly playing suboptimally, so there is no correct or standard limp-calling range.
With some knowledge of the player, you may be able to predict in what way their play will deviate from the optimum. Common types of limp-callers include:

Extreme Loose-Passives
These are recreational players who treat poker like blackjack. They aren‚Äôt thinking strategically about concepts like equity denial or SPR. They just want to see flops and try to make hands. They will limp all kinds of stuff, from offsuit broadway cards to pocket pairs to random suited hands. Even they usually have folding ranges, though, so the worst hands can still be discounted. You can raise most aggressively into these limpers.

Speculators
These players draw a sharp distinction between ‚Äúraising hands‚Äù and ‚Äúspeculative hands.‚Äù They are more likely than the other types to raise their stronger hands, especially big pairs and offsuit broadway cards. When they limp and call, it is most often with small pairs or suited connectors looking for very specific flops. You can raise aggressively into these limpers, as they rarely have strong hands, but after the flop, you must proceed with caution on the boards most likely to improve them.

Extreme Nits
Nits are tight-passive rather than loose-passive and are usually extremely risk-averse. They may limp-call hands as strong as AKo on the theory that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúdrawing hand‚Äù or with KK or QQ waiting to see whether there‚Äôs an Ace on the flop before committing more chips. Raising these players is less appealing, especially as they are more likely than the other types to limp-reraise (because their limping range contains more hands that look attractive to reraise).
For our examples here, we will assign the limp-caller a range based on empirical data. Though it includes many types of hands, it is nevertheless weighted toward suited hands, broadway cards, and Ace-x holdings, consistent with several of the player types discussed above.
LJ limp-calling range vs BTN raise

To Raise, or Not To Raise
When one or more players limp in front of you, a good rule of thumb is to play a strictly raise-or-fold strategy unless you have the Button (or are in one of the Blinds). Without the guarantee of position after the flop, you can‚Äôt get too out-of-line anyway, so you should mostly be contesting the pot with strong hands that want to grow the pot immediately, and you will benefit from denying equity (or at least charging a higher price) to the players behind you. In fact, one of the biggest risks of overlimping when you do not have the BTN is that a player with position on you will raise and punish you along with the rest of the limpers.
With limpers in front of you, play a strictly raise-or-fold strategy unless you have the BTN or are in one of the Blinds.
Not To Raise (To Call)
When you do have the BTN, overlimping is worth considering. Risking just a single big blind, you do not need to be an equity favorite to enter the pot. You need only realize your share of equity, which should be easy to do in position if you choose the right kind of hands to limp behind.
The best candidates are hands that are not strong enough to raise but will perform well in a high-SPR multiway pot. This includes small pairs, smaller suited and connected cards, and possibly even some of the better disconnected suited hands like Q6s and offsuit connected cards like 98o. The weaker your competition, the more you can get away with.
To Raise
We will not consider limped pots further here because they do not lend themselves well to solver analysis, but it‚Äôs worth noting that the BTN raising range used in the following scenarios assumes you would also have an overlimp range. If you were to play a strictly raise-or-fold scenario, a few additional hands (such as T8s, 87s, and 55) could be considered for inclusion in the raising range.
BTN raising range vs LJ limp
This range is designed to play well with a lower SPR, to have good equity against wide limp-calling ranges, and in particular to dominate those ranges. You may be accustomed to thinking of A9 as an easily dominated hand, but against an opponent playing any Ace and many worse 9-x, you will more often dominate them. Additionally, position will be a useful tool for bluffing, squeezing out thin value, exercising pot control, and even getting away from some second-best hands.
Lower your threshold for what counts as a value hand.
Aggression actually exploits loose-passive opponents in two ways:
Their willingness to call with weak hands makes betting and raising low-equity hands less profitable. However, it increases the value of betting and raising with high-equity hands. And because wider calling ranges are weaker calling ranges, more hands will have good equity against them. This means you can lower your threshold for what counts as a ‚Äúvalue hand,‚Äù especially when in position.
Aggression also exploits passivity. You can bet and raise for thin value without worrying about bluff raises that could push you off the winning hand. Passive opponents may not even raise their strong hands, giving you more opportunities to realize equity and the value of your position on future streets. In fact, when you raise from the CO or BTN against limpers, you profit not only from the weak ranges of the limpers themselves but also from the passivity of the players who have not yet acted, who could exploit you by 3-betting aggressively but are unlikely to do so.
You benefit much more from your opponents‚Äô looseness when you are in position.
I have emphasized position several times because you benefit much more from your opponents‚Äô looseness when you are in position. For one thing, calling with weak hands is more often correct when in position. At the very least, your opponents‚Äô loose calls will be less costly mistakes if they will play in position against you on future streets.
Before the flop, or in multiway spots postflop, you are not necessarily the beneficiary of your opponents‚Äô loose mistakes when your position is poor. When you raise from early position, and an opponent makes a bad call in middle position, they are often transferring EV from themselves and from you to the players who have not yet acted‚Äîwhose strong hands will benefit from the weak money in the pot. The best way for them to profit from this scenario is by squeezing aggressively, so again, you may benefit from their excessive passivity.

Worst Nightmare Flop
Medium connected boards are the ones most likely to improve the many speculative hands in a typical limp-calling range. For a worst-case scenario, 764tt is really not that bad. And yes, it is a worst-case scenario. On the more connected 876tt, BTN also flops some straights and more sets. And on more connected low card boards, the limper has more whiffs.
Medium connected boards are most likely to improve a limp-calling range.
Even on this nightmare flop, the limper does not overcome BTN‚Äôs significant preflop equity advantage; they merely catch up. At the high end, they have the nuts advantage thanks to 85s, 53s, and 44. But they also have more very weak hands, which raises an important point: a player who plays many weak hands preflop will flop many weak hands, even on their best flops. For every 85s, there‚Äôs a K2s and several combinations of QTo. Very loose players occasionally get lucky and flop miraculous straights and two pairs with hands you wouldn‚Äôt expect to see, but far more often, they whiff the flop entirely or connect only weakly with hands like bottom pair and gutshot draws.
Equity distributions on 764tt (left = LJ limp-caller, right = BTN raiser)
It‚Äôs also important to recognize that, despite the speculator‚Äôs preference for suited hands, they flop a flush draw barely 8% of the time. Most hands aren‚Äôt suited, and even suited hands match the suit on the flop less than 25% of the time.
Open-ended straight draws are slightly more common, roughly 12% of their range. These risks are real, and they provide some incentive to bet the flop, but charging draws is not the all-consuming strategic necessity it is sometimes made out to be.
Charging draws is not an all-consuming strategic necessity.
Indeed, BTN checks more than half their range, including some overpairs:
BTN flop strategy on 764tt vs LJ check
The pure checks are all unpaired overcards, especially those without backdoor draws. These are great examples of hands that want to preserve equity by not opening themselves up to a check-raise and by keeping the pot small. With a hand like K‚ô¶Q‚ô¶, BTN can feel a lot better on a Q‚ô• turn after checking the flop than after betting it.
BTN also prefers a smaller bet size here because their advantage is at the low end rather than the high end of the equity distribution. The small bet denies equity to the limper‚Äôs many weak hands without risking too large a pot against the top of their range.
That said, it really is the risk of a check-raise more so than the risk of running into strong hands that motivates BTN‚Äôs checks. With position and 50% of the equity, putting more money into the pot with their entire range is not a problem as long as they get to realize that equity. Against more passive opponents who will not check-raise for thin value nor with weak draws, betting a wider range is more appealing.

Dynamic Flop
Changing a single card on the flop to eliminate the straight possibility (and some of the draws) and introduce more pairs into BTN‚Äôs range dramatically changes the dynamics. On J‚ô†7‚ô•6‚ô•, BTN has 56% of the equity and a stronger range throughout. This facilitates a much higher continuation betting frequency and some bigger bets.
Equity distribution graph on J76tt
BTN flop strategy on J76tt vs LJ check
Every hand in BTN‚Äôs range is vulnerable to draws and/or overcards. Even if a bad turn card does not cost them the pot, it may cost them action from hands that would have paid off a flop bet. Thus, there is very little slowplaying, with most of the checks coming from hands like medium pairs which gain the least from folds, are most vulnerable to check-raises, and do not want to play a particularly large pot anyway.
Against opponents who will not check-raise aggressively enough, this strategy can simplify to a range-bet, with more incentive to bet bigger with stronger hands as well.

Ace-High Flop
Despite having an even bigger range advantage, with nearly 60% of the equity, BTN c-bets less often on A‚ô†7‚ô•6‚ô• than on J‚ô†7‚ô•6‚ô•.
BTN flop strategy on A76tt vs LJ check
This is because they have more hands with modest, relatively static equity, most notably pocket Kings & Queens, and weak Ace-x. These hands gain little from fold equity and do not want to play a big pot against the top of the limper‚Äôs range. Charging draws is nice, but the risk of putting in chips from way behind is substantial. When BTN does not hold an Ace, the limper has top pair or better about 22% of the time.
If the limper continues checking later streets, the weak Ace-x will be strong enough to bet for value on many turns and rivers, whereas the pocket pairs will mostly check it down. With so much Ace-x in the limper‚Äôs range, blocking it does a lot to increase a hand‚Äôs value!

Conclusion
Much like when they are heads up against a BB caller, an IP raiser starts with a significant range advantage over a loose limp-caller. Against your average limper, this is true even if they raise a relatively wide range themselves (provided that range is built around strong hands that perform well at a lower SPR).
There are no flops that ‚Äúsmack‚Äù a loose limp-caller‚Äôs range.
There are no flops that ‚Äúsmack‚Äù a loose limp-caller‚Äôs range. The best flops get them up to about even, compelling the raiser to develop a checking range, mostly when raises are a legitimate threat.
On all but the most coordinated flops, the raiser can c-bet aggressively for value and equity denial. More static flops also incentivize a checking range not because of any equity disadvantage but simply because some hands will not gain enough from betting to compensate for the risks. This is especially true on Ace-high flops, as both players‚Äô ranges are heavy on Ace-x.

### TOPIC: multi street bluff
The Math of Multi-Street Bluffs
Bluffing is a fundamental skill in poker, blending deception with strategic calculation to sway the outcomes of hands. While numerous resources delve into the basics of bluffing, few explore the theory behind triple-barrel bluffing.
In this article, we explore the math of multi-street bluffing in poker. Specifically, how to calculate the expected value (EV) of bluffing across multiple streets.
Join us in the investigation to uncover the mathematical underpinnings that elevate bluffing from an intuitive gamble to a calculated strategy.
The Basics: Single-Street Bluffs
The basic theory of a single-street bluff is straightforward:
Calculate the Minimum Defense Frequency (MDF)
For your bluff to be profitable, your opponent needs to fold more often than (1 ‚Äì MDF)
The expected value of a pure bluff
is also easy to calculate:
EV (Bluff) = Fold%(Pot) ‚Äì Defend%(Bet)
If your EV > 0, then you have a profitable pure bluff. Simple!
But here‚Äôs the thing:
If your bluff gets called (before the river), you don‚Äôt need to give up. You have the option to continue bluffing on later streets.
How does that change the math?
Quiz
Let‚Äôs test your intuitive understanding with a simple toy game:
You hold a pure bluff
 on the flop and are considering a triple-barrel bluff (of pot-sized bets). Villain always calls flop and turn. How often do they have to fold the river for your triple-barrel to break even?
Fold 50%
Fold 61%
Fold 72%
Fold 83%
Reveal Answer
Explanation
In order for triple-barreling to be +EV, they need to be folding a ton on the river so that you can recuperate your lost flop and turn bets. Remember, you‚Äôre not trying to break even on your standalone river play, you want the entire line from flop‚Üíriver to be (at least) breakeven.
So how does one calculate the right answer? Track contributions!
If the starting pot is 1, you bet (1, 3, 9) on (flop, turn, river). If your triple barrel gets called down, you‚Äôll end up losing (1+3+9) = 13 starting pots. If it‚Äôs successful, you‚Äôll gain (1+1+3) = 5 starting pots. So you‚Äôre risking 13 to win 5. Converting the odds to an implied probability: 13:5 = 13 / (13 + 5) = 72.2%
Starting pot = 1
Gain if we get a fold = starting pot + villain‚Äôs contributions = (1) + (1 + 3) = 5
Loss if we get a call = hero‚Äôs contributions = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13
You‚Äôre risking 13 to win 5
Breakeven River Fold% = Risk / (Risk + Reward) = 13 / (13 + 5) = 72.2%
They need to fold 72.2% of the time to our river bet, just to break even on a pot-sized triple-barrel bluff. Anything less than that, and you‚Äôd be better off giving up on the flop.
Generally speaking, multi-street bluffs offer a worse risk-reward ratio than single-street bluffs, because you end up risking more than you stand to gain.
But this is a contrived example! No one is calling 100% of the time on flop and turn, just to fold ¬æ of the time on the river. Let‚Äôs try a more realistic but also more complex example next.
The Math of Multi-Street Bluffs
Now, we will walk through the math of a multi-street bluff to handle more realistic scenarios.
What follows is not meant for over-the-table calculations. Rather, we recommend examining population tendencies and using a spreadsheet calculator to find over-folded lines.
To simplify things, we‚Äôll make three assumptions:
Your bluff always loses when you check
Your bluff always loses when it gets called down
Villain will only call or fold
Given these assumptions, there are only four strategies to choose from:
Check: Give up immediately, lose nothing.
Bet ‚Üí Check: Bet once with the intention of giving up on the turn if called.
Bet ‚Üí Bet ‚Üí Check: Bet twice with the intention of giving up on the river if called.
Bet ‚Üí Bet ‚Üí Bet: Bet thrice with no intention of giving up.
We will calculate and compare the EV of each strategy and choose the most profitable one.
Strategy (1) Check
This strategy‚Äôs EV is just 0 because we‚Äôre measuring EV relative to this decision point. If you give up immediately, you lose the hand without investing further into this bluff.
EV (Check) = 0
Strategy (2) Bet ‚Üí Check
The expected value of (2)‚Äîbetting once with the intention of giving up on the turn‚Äîis just the standard single-street calculation:
Multiply the probability (p) and value (v) of each event, then add them together to find the expected value:
EV (Bet ‚Üí Check) = p‚ÇÅv‚ÇÅ + p‚ÇÇv‚ÇÇ
Written out explicitly:
EV (Bet ‚Üí Check) = Flop Fold% (Pot) + Flop Call% (-Flop Bet)
Strategy (3) Bet ‚Üí Bet ‚Üí Check
The expected value of (3)‚Äîbetting twice with the intention of giving up on the river‚Äîis a bit more complicated. There are three possible outcomes.
If they immediately fold, you win the pot. If they call flop and fold turn, then you win the pot plus their flop call. If they call twice then you lose your flop and turn bets.
EV (Bet ‚Üí Bet ‚Üí Check) = p‚ÇÅv‚ÇÅ + p‚ÇÇv‚ÇÇ + p‚ÇÉv‚ÇÉ
Written out explicitly:
EV (Bet ‚Üí Bet ‚Üí Check) = (Flop Fold%) (Pot) + (Flop Call% Turn Fold%) (Pot + Flop Bet) + (Flop Call% Turn Call%) (-Flop Bet ‚Äì Turn Bet)
Strategy (4) Bet ‚Üí Bet ‚Üí Bet
Lastly, we examine the triple-barrel strategy, which entails four possible outcomes:
EV (Bet ‚Üí Bet ‚Üí Bet) = p‚ÇÅv‚ÇÅ + p‚ÇÇv‚ÇÇ + p‚ÇÉv‚ÇÉ + p‚ÇÑv‚ÇÑ
Spreadsheet Calculator
As you can see, this is a long and tedious calculation. It‚Äôs not difficult, just monotonous. This is the kind of work spreadsheets were made for. Here you can access my free spreadsheet calculator:
Multistreet Bluff Calculator ‚Äì Public Version
The tool is simple to use; just plug in the bet sizes and fold% for each street. The calculator will show you the EV of each strategy (under the aforementioned assumptions).
Example
You have a pure bluff on the flop. You‚Äôre up against the type of villain that over-folds flop, then over-defends the turn, then plays scared money on the river.
As instructed earlier, we plug in the bet sizes and fold percentages:
The first step is to convert these bet sizes from a percentage into chips. This is important because as the pot grows, we risk more for the same bet percentage. We need to compare ‚Äúapples to apples‚Äù or ‚Äúchips to chips‚Äù in this case. For simplicity, we will use a starting pot of 1 chip.
Step two is then to calculate the EV of each strategy:
Strategy (1) Check
Give up instantly.
EV = 0
Strategy (2) Bet ‚Üí Check
Bet once, then give up.
EV (Bet ‚Üí Check) = p‚ÇÅv‚ÇÅ + p‚ÇÇv‚ÇÇ = 0.4 ‚Äì 0.2 = 0.2
The expected value of betting once is 0.2 starting pots.
Strategy (3) Bet ‚Üí Bet ‚Üí Check
Bet twice, then give up.
EV (Bet ‚Üí Bet ‚Üí Check) = p‚ÇÅv‚ÇÅ + p‚ÇÇv‚ÇÇ + p‚ÇÉv‚ÇÉ = 0.4 + 0.263 ‚Äì 0.633 = 0.03
The expected value of betting twice is 0.03 starting pots.
Note that our EV has dropped compared to the previous strategy. Villain is over-defending against the turn bet, so we lose most of the fold equity gained from the flop. We gained 0.4 pots in fold equity on the flop, then lost 0.37 by barreling again on the turn.
Strategy (4) Bet ‚Üí Bet ‚Üí Bet
Triple-barrel without giving up. No retreat, no surrender.
EV (Bet ‚Üí Bet ‚Üí Bet) = p‚ÇÅv‚ÇÅ + p‚ÇÇv‚ÇÇ + p‚ÇÉv‚ÇÉ + p‚ÇÑv‚ÇÑ = 0.4 + 0.263 + 0.672 ‚Äì 0.807 = 0.528
The expected value of betting thrice is 0.53 starting pots. This is the most profitable strategy we have found!
Even though the turn barrel was unprofitable, we more than made up for it by betting again on the river.
The third and final step is to compare the strategies (based on the calculated EVs).
Again, note that these EV values are in ‚Äústarting pots,‚Äù which we set to 1 chip. If the starting pot were 10 chips (or bb, or dollars), then you would multiply each of those figures by 10.
What About Bet ‚Üí Check ‚Üí Bet?
So far, we‚Äôve assumed that we always give up if we check. But that‚Äôs not necessarily true. In our example, villain is over-defending turns but over-folding rivers. So why not just check turn?
Let‚Äôs add a new strategy to our roster:
Strategy (5) Bet ‚Üí Check ‚Üí Bet
Let‚Äôs assume that villain will bet 50% of the time if we check to them on the turn, with a value-heavy range that we always fold to.
Furthermore, we‚Äôll assume that they fold 75% of the time if we pot the river after they check behind on the turn. In this case, we are betting 1.66 chips into a pot of 1.66 on the river.
EV (Bet ‚Üí Check ‚Üí Bet) = p‚ÇÅv‚ÇÅ + p‚ÇÇv‚ÇÇ + p‚ÇÉv‚ÇÉ + p‚ÇÑv‚ÇÑ = 0.4 ‚Äì 0.099 + 0.299 ‚Äì 0.149 = 0.451
The expected value of betting twice (with an interruption on the turn) is 0.45 starting pots. Even though it seemed promising, it‚Äôs not as good as triple-barreling.
Summary
Most poker theory content stops short at the math behind a single-street bluff. However, this calculation fails when looking at multi-street bluffs. Many coaches will say something along the lines of ‚Äúpopulation over-folds rivers, so try and steer them into these lines.‚Äù But a profitable river bluff doesn‚Äôt necessarily make up for unprofitable flop and turn bluffs. This is why multi-street calculations are essential for any kind of population data analysis. If you‚Äôre looking for lines where your player pool over-folds, you can‚Äôt just look at each street in a vacuum. You need to calculate the EV of the entire line to find +EV bluffs.
The mathematics of multi-street bluff EV calculations is not difficult, but it‚Äôs tedious. While there is value in going through examples manually, in practice, you‚Äôre better off using a calculator so you can run many spots quickly and efficiently.
Even without doing mass data analysis, there are still some key takeaways to be aware of:
Multi-street bluffs tend to offer a worse risk-reward ratio than single-street bluffs. The risk tends to outpace the reward as the pot grows each street.
Having a profitable river bluff isn‚Äôt a license to triple-barrel everything. The EV of your river bluff needs to compensate for any negative EV on flop and/or turn, for the entire line to be profitable.
When doing any sort of EV calculation, it is wise to break down all strategies and all outcomes of those strategies. Rather than creating lengthy formulas that encompass everything at once, break it down into a table, as shown above.
Clearly, there is a limit to what you can do at the table during a live game. Multi-street bluff calculations should be done off-table when doing exploitative analysis.
Sometimes, the most obvious line ‚â† the most profitable line.

10 Tips for Multiway Pots in Poker
While lots of work has been placed into research and explanation of heads-up pot strategy, multiway pots still largely remain an unexplored frontier in poker. Multiway dynamics feature very different strategic ideas compared to HU. As expert player Matt Hunt stated in his multiway course, Three‚Äôs A Crowd: ‚ÄúMultiway postflop spots are more similar to multiway preflop than heads-up postflop‚Äù.
We‚Äôve written this article to provide a theoretical foundation for improving your multiway play. GTO Wizard plans to launch multiway postflop solutions in 2025. However, this article aims to equip you with the knowledge you need to crush your opponents now. It‚Äôs important to note that many of the heuristics used in multiway preflop play also apply to multiway postflop. Many players mistake these principles as being specific to preflop when, in reality, they often stem from the broader dynamics of multiway pots.

1) Multiway Equilibrium Problems
Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, we must examine how the fundamental claims of Nash Equilibrium (GTO) change in multiway spots. Nash Equilibrium has a desirable property: if you follow a GTO strategy, you are assured a minimum expected value, and your opponent‚Äôs errors can only raise your payoff. This assurance is absent multiway. There is no such thing as an unexploitable strategy in multiway scenarios. Your expected value is no longer guaranteed.
When someone makes a mistake in a multiway pot, their expected value isn‚Äôt simply distributed to the remaining players in the hand as you might expect. That player‚Äôs mistake can decrease someone else‚Äôs expected value to the benefit of a third player! No strategy, be it GTO or exploitative, is safe from this effect. If this is the case, how can we be sure the GTO solution for multiway scenarios are legitimate? This question has been tackled by Noam Brown, a prominent expert in computational game theory and the creator of advanced poker AI‚Äôs such as Libratus and Pluribus. When asked about the distinction between Heads-Up and Multiway poker in an interview with Lex Friedman, Noam stated (paraphrased):
‚ÄúIt turns out that the methods used to approximate equilibrium in 2-player poker work effectively in practice for 6-player poker, due to the adversarial nature of the game where players do not cooperate.‚Äù
We know that GTO can be approximated in multiway poker. Other evidence for this claim comes from the fact that different solver algorithms reach the same multiway strategies even using vastly different methods. With the hardcore theory out of the way, let‚Äôs now delve into the most impactful factors in multiway pots.

2) Shared Burden Of Defense
In poker, we use Minimum Defense Frequency (MDF) to calculate how wide some player needs to defend to prevent the other from profitably bluffing. The inverse of this calculation is Alpha (Œ±)‚Äì how many folds you need to have a profitable pure bluff. Learn more about MDF and Alpha here.
Consider what happens if you make a pot-sized bluff in a multiway pot. For your bluff to be profitable, you need to take down the pot at least 50% of the time. That means in a heads-up pot your opponent needs to defend at least half the time. However, in a multiway pot, the burden of defense is shared!
Folding frequencies are multiplicative ‚Äì each player only needs to defend often enough such that, between both of them, they aren‚Äôt folding more than half the time. The probability of taking down the pot with some bet is equal to:
Total fold%=Player1 fold% √ó Player2 fold% √ó Player3 fold% ‚Ä¶
The average folding frequency per player is then alpha to the nth root of the number of defending players:
n = number of defending players
Œ± = The alpha of a HU bet, which is equal to s/(s+1)
s = bet/pot
In practice, the player who closes the action takes on a larger portion of defense than the players before them. This is because the player who closes the action has more profitable defends, given that they don‚Äôt risk being pushed out that street. However, we can use the simplified equation above to demonstrate the strategic differences in multiway pots.
The following table displays the average defense required per player to meet MDF:
In a heads-up pot, if your opponent bets 10% of the pot, you‚Äôd need to defend 91% of your range to prevent them from profitably bluffing. If there were 8 players defending against this tiny bet, your defense frequency drops to about 26%! The difference is dramatic. In fact, even a 1% pot-sized bet offers a drastic reduction in your overall defense. In a HU pot, if your opponent bets 1% of the pot, you‚Äôd need to defend about 99% of your range. That drops to 44% in a 9-way pot.
Multiway pots feature an absolutely terrible risk/reward ratio on pure bluffs. Your opponents can defend much tighter, even against very small bets, while still preventing you from profitably bluffing. Meanwhile, pot odds don‚Äôt change. Any hand that can capture enough EV can continue against this bet.

3) Tight Is Right
As shown in section 2, in multiway pots, your opponents can defend less often without becoming exploitable (lower burden of defense), while at the same time, they are free to defend more often if your range is too weak. This leads to a very simple yet crucial heuristic:
Tight is Right!
You do not need to defend nearly as wide in multiway pots as you would in heads-up pots. The thresholds for what hands should continue against some bet size get much tighter. Simultaneously, your betting range should become much stronger. Pure bluffs are ineffective multiway ‚Äì you need stronger value bets, and stronger bluffs. With the exception of the river, You‚Äôd do well to almost never bluff a hand without solid drawing equity.

4) Stop Rangebetting
Rangebetting means betting your entire range in some spot, typically for a small size. This strategy is common in HU postflop spots but fails miserably in most multiway spots.
The strategic premise of rangebetting is that you have such an overwhelming advantage that your opponent is forced to overfold despite you betting any two. However, in multiway pots, your opponents are not obliged to defend very wide at all. That works directly against the incentives of rangebetting ‚Äì all that extra fold equity you get heads-up evaporates multiway.
So the simplest change you can make to improve your multiway strategy is this: Stop rangebetting. Give up more often with trash. Tighten your value betting thresholds. Check back more medium hands and play for showdown.

5) Nut Potential is King
Nut potential is the potential of a draw to become the nuts, or very close to it. For example, on a flop like A‚ô†Q‚ô†8‚ô•, a draw like 6‚ô†4‚ô† has poor nut potential since it can only make a weak flush. A hand like K‚ô†7‚ô†, however, draws to the nut flush and therefore has strong nut potential.
Nut potential is vital because stack-off ranges become much tighter multiway.
When considering a semibluff in a multiway pot, give more consideration to your outs. Are you drawing to just a strong hand, or a nutted hand? Do any of your outs complete stronger draws? The importance of these questions is greatly amplified multiway.
Furthermore, betting frequencies in multiway pots strongly correlate with nut advantage. A player with a range advantage that lacks the strongest hands should typically play more passively (unless the SPR is very low).
Consider what happens if you rangebet a board like 753r as BTN vs SB and BB. Sure, you‚Äôve got the overpairs, but they have, proportionally, many more nutted hands like sets, two pair, and straights. Your overpairs get a lot less value from marginal pairs, and get attacked much more often by dangerous check-raises.

6) Higher Implied (And Reverse Implied) Odds
Here‚Äôs a GIF from our Visualizing Implied Odds article, which displays how equities shift multiway. The exact numbers aren‚Äôt important. Rather, pay attention to the color-coded gradient.
Section 5 leads directly to our next point. Multiway pots increase implied and reverse implied odds. The effect is similar to how implied odds also increase in deep-stacked pots. The tighter stack-off thresholds in multiway pots mean you need stronger hands to go all-in for value than HU pots. Static bluff-catchers, medium hands that struggle to improve, even marginal top pairs lose a lot of value. The hands that do well multiway have better ‚Äúvisibility‚Äù; more paths to the nuts. Your hand‚Äôs ability to improve to something very nutted counts for so much more.
The type of hands that retain equity multiway typically have strong drawing potential. Suited connectors, suited gappers, hands that can make the nut flush, etc.

7) Use Smaller Bet Sizes
We‚Äôve said it before, and we‚Äôll say it again ‚Äì defense gets much tighter multiway. Therefore, it‚Äôs very easy to overplay your range if you use large sizings. Consider your equity retention carefully in multiway pots. Equity retention is how much equity your hand retains once your bet is called.
[NL500 Cash] BTN opens BB calls, flop is A‚ô£T‚ô£2‚ô†. In a heads-up pot, BTN normally prefers overbetting. Here‚Äôs their equity once BB calls a 125% pot-sized bet (BB even overfolds quite a bit here!). Most of the strong top pairs are still well ahead of the calling range. As a reminder, the flop is A‚ô£T‚ô£2‚ô†
Now let‚Äôs compare this to a multiway spot. [NL500 Cash] BTN opens, SB calls, BB calls. We‚Äôll use ranges from GTO Wizard. The average burden of defense is 25% per player facing this overbet (compared to 44% HU). Typically, SB would defend less than BB, but let‚Äôs just simplify and make both players call with the top quarter of their preflop calling range. As a reminder, the flop is A‚ô£T‚ô£2‚ô†. Here‚Äôs BTN‚Äôs equity against the top 25% of SB and BB‚Äôs range.
Surprisingly, even some two-pair like A2, or strong top pair like AK, are behind the collective calling ranges! We have effectively overplayed two-pair with a single flop bet‚Ä¶ Note that the blinds should actually fold quite a bit more, so I‚Äôm overestimating BTN‚Äôs equity here.
This is why you should typically size down in multiway pots. Your equity retention just plummets off a cliff as the collective defense facing large bets results in extremely strong ranges. That said, there are certain spots where you can overbet multiway. These strategies are reserved for scenarios where you have a significant nut advantage and can profitably play for stacks with those nutted hands. Multiway overbets are much rarer than in HU pots.

8) Positional Advantage Increases
Positional advantage stems from the information gained from your opponents acting first, as well as the ability to close the action on each street. In multiway pots, positional advantage gets amplified as you have even more information, and closing the action becomes more valuable. Conversely, it‚Äôs much less profitable to play when many players are yet-to-act behind you.
The simplest way to demonstrate this principle is to compare BTN‚Äôs cold-calling range to SB‚Äôs cold-calling range. In most cash games, BTN should defend wider than SB facing an open raise, despite BTN having more players left-to-act behind and a worse price on calling.
Let‚Äôs cherry-pick a deepstack spot to demonstrate this principle (deep stacks further magnify positional advantage). [500NL 200bb Cash] CO opens 2.5bb. Let‚Äôs compare the BTN and SB preflop defense.
BTN vs CO RFI
SB vs CO RFI
Note that BTN defends 8% wider than SB! This is a function of having position on the preflop raiser but also potentially having position in a multiway pot. The SB is getting a better price and has fewer players behind them. But those two factors don‚Äôt mitigate the pain of being out of position twice. Therefore, the SB plays tighter than BTN in this spot. Obviously, being out of position twice is very bad. But what about being in the middle?
Playing ‚Äúmonkey in the middle‚Äù with a player behind and in front of you is also not a strong proposition. A common mistake that many players make is they believe that the BB should defend a much wider preflop range after SB calls an IP open, but this is not usually the case. Yes, you‚Äôre getting better pot odds, but your equity retention multiway is much worse
As demonstrated in Daily Dose # 64 and Daily Dose #342, most hands lose value going multiway. There are exceptions to this rule, for example if one of the cold-callers is extremely wide then you can overcall wide too. The price of the initial bet also plays a large part.

9) Blocker Effects Are Amplified
Blockers become more important multiway. As blockers interact with more ranges, the card removal effects become more powerful. Here‚Äôs an example. [NL500 6max Cash, 200bb deep] UTG opens. How often does UTG expect to take down the pot? Here‚Äôs how often they steal the blinds when opening with different holdings:
That‚Äôs a fairly significant difference. AK expects to steal the blinds 7.3% more often than 22 when opening UTG! This is because AK blocks the hands that call or raise UTGs open, while 22 mainly blocks the hands that fold. The same concept extends multiway postflop. Blocking the nuts counts for a lot more. Blocking folds is more problematic for your bluffs. Blocking continues makes it substantially harder to get paid with your value hands.

10) Capped Ranges Are Less Exploitable
A ‚Äúcapped‚Äù range does not contain the strongest hands. In HU pots, you need to be much more concerned with the exploitability of your range. If you check back too many weak hands and don‚Äôt slow-play enough strong hands, then your opponents can exploit your weakened range with excessive aggression!
In multiway pots, however, capped ranges become less of a problem as multiple players share the burden of defense. An aggressor with a range advantage has to go through multiple opponents. Here‚Äôs an example. [NL500 100bb 6max Cash] UTG opens 2bb. Here‚Äôs BB‚Äôs defense when it folds to them:
Compare the above range to the below range, which shows how BB defends after SB cold-calls:
When BB is going HU against UTG, they flat with hands as strong as AKo and QQ, and AQ‚ô† sometimes. These strong traps are required to ensure the rest of their calling range doesn‚Äôt get run over.
Compare that to BB‚Äôs strategy after SB flats ‚Äì they‚Äôre much more inclined to squeeze with the top of their range and leave their calling range more exposed. Part of this has to do with the incentives of squeezing, but also results from capped ranges being less exploitable in multiway spots. Most squeeze strategies are very linear, and very top-heavy for this exact reason. Generally speaking, you need to play ‚Äúmore honestly‚Äù in multiway pots. Betting ranges become more linear multiway both pre and postflop. By ‚Äúhonestly‚Äù, I don‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs literally no deception, but a player‚Äôs actions should more closely reflect the value of their range multiway. If someone is betting too big, and too weak, they will rarely get the fold equity required for their bluffs, and their value range will quickly fall behind the tightened calling ranges of the defending players. Equity retention falls off a cliff, and they become extremely vulnerable to check-raises or counter-aggression.
However, what‚Äôs more interesting are the checking ranges. Everyone‚Äôs checking range is generally weaker and more capped multiway. This is partly because betting ranges are more honest but also because there‚Äôs slightly less need for protection with multiple players sharing the burden of defense. In a sense, the other players are acting as a shield that prevents any individual from running your capped range over. This means that river ranges are often quite weak when action checks down. Even more so in practice, as players tend to value bet too thin multiway. For this reason, many MDA study groups promote aggressive bluffing in multiway spots when actions checks to the river.

Conclusion
The biggest challenge of betting in multiway pots is that players can defend much tighter without becoming exploitable, while at the same time, they are free to defend more often than needed if the betting range is too weak
In summary
Players share the responsibility of defense, leading to tighter calling ranges.
Betting with air or range betting is not typically a viable strategy.
Use smaller bet sizes due to decreased equity retention.
Use stronger betting ranges, with stronger thresholds for value bets and bluffs.
Place more value on implied odds, equity retention, and nut potential.
Positional advantage becomes more valuable.
Blockers are more significant as card removal effects interact with multiple ranges.
It becomes harder to attack capped ranges with another player involved.
Bets become more linear and check-downs become more capped.
The GTO solution is no longer guaranteed to be unexploitable.
### TOPIC: oop 4bet deep stack
OOP 4-Betting in Deep-Stacked Cash Games
4-bet pots (4BP) can be scary because the stakes are high, but with 100bb stacks, they are not really tough to navigate. The narrow ranges and extremely low stack-to-pot ratio (SPR) make it relatively simple to assess the strength of your hand compared to, say, a single-raised pot.
With deeper stacks, things get a bit trickier. The SPR is still low, but not quite as low. Both players‚Äô ranges are a bit more diverse, which makes it trickier to assess which flop favors which player and by how much. And, of course, everything is tougher when you are out of position (OOP), which is more of a liability with deeper stacks.
Thanks to the low SPR, the decision of whether to continuation bet as an OOP 4-bettor is an especially weighty one. Even a small bet invests many chips in an already large pot, so it is essential to understand:
When to bet?
How much to bet?
How strong your hand must be to stack off?
Big Picture
Let‚Äôs begin with a look at the aggregate data. The charts below compare the frequency with which the 4-bettor c-bets various sizes in each configuration with both 100bb and 200bb starting stacks.
What patterns do you notice?
Small Continuation Bets
The 4-bettor‚Äôs continuation bets are consistently small, with all configurations showing a preference for half-pot or less. With 200bb stacks, there are slightly more 75% pot bets, but they still comprise a very small fraction of the overall strategy. There are three main reasons to prefer small sizes here:
With such a low SPR (1.8 at a starting depth of 100bb, 2.4 when 200bb deep), large bets are not necessary to get stacks in by the river.
The low SPR also reduces the incentive to get stacks in before the river on dynamic boards. In most cases, a strong hand on the flop will still be strong enough to get all-in despite a turn or river card that completes some draws. So, you don‚Äôt need to worry as much about getting bluffed on bad runouts.
When OOP, you have more incentive to keep your ranges diverse because you don‚Äôt get to check to realize (free card or showdown). Shifting strong hands disproportionately into a larger bet range would leave your checks and smaller bets vulnerable to aggression (often big bets and raises) from your opponent, which creates an incentive to shift your strong hands back into those other ranges in order to profit from those big bets and raises.
More Checking When Deep
When the stack depth is held constant, frequencies don‚Äôt vary terribly much with configuration. When comparing the 100b strategies to the 200bb strategies, however, we see much more checking across all configurations. This is actually due less to deeper stacks making position more valuable (the SPR is quite low in both cases) and more to the range shape of the 4-bettor. Deeper stacks incentivize a more polar 4-betting strategy, and that translates into a more polar c-betting strategy, especially on less favorable flops.
For example, with 100bb, CO usually 4-bets TT‚ÄìQQ and occasionally pairs as weak as 77. These hands gain a lot from preflop folds, can stack off on many flops thanks to the low SPR, and can call a preflop shove if it comes to that.
With 200bb, CO rarely 4-bets JJ‚ÄìTT and never the weaker pairs. Replacing these pairs are more suited Ace-x and King-x combos and some suited connectors. At this deeper stack depth, it‚Äôs tougher to stack off both pre- and post-flop with the medium pairs, so CO prefers not to grow such a large pot with them. Instead, they prefer blockers to BTN‚Äôs continuing range and weaker hands that lose less when jammed on but have the potential to flop a lot of equity.
Range Comparison: CO 4-Bet vs BTN
100bb effective, 4-bet to 21bb
200bb effective, 4-bet to 34bb
Aggregate Strategy Comparison
Sorting the data by high card on the flop, we can see that the reduction in c-betting frequency with 200bb stacks occurs only on lower flops. On Ace- and King-high (and Queen-high, for the CO vs BTN configuration), OOP retains a high c-betting frequency. Because their range is so heavy on high cards, however, they approach lower flops more conservatively, using the larger, half-pot bet size almost exclusively when they do bet.
UTG C-Bet vs BTN
Effective stack size: 100bb (‚Üë) and 200bb (‚Üì)
CO C-Bet vs BTN
Effective stack size: 100bb (‚Üë) and 200bb (‚Üì)
Low, Connected Flop
Low, connected flops are bad for the 4-bettor, but they are not the worst flops. That honor belongs to medium, connected flops, where the strategy is mostly to check.
Most checked flops by CO vs BTN: 4BP, 200bb starting
In some ways, this makes the low-and-connected boards trickier to play because the optimal strategy involves a mix of betting and checking. On 765r in a CO vs BTN 4BP, for example, very few combos play a pure strategy at equilibrium:
CO (4-bettor) c-bet flop strategy vs BTN on 765r
There is a bit of a pattern, however, in that CO‚Äôs strongest hands (overpairs) bet most often, and to the extent that there are pure checks, they come from CO‚Äôs very worst hands:
One lesson to take from this is not to put up a fight with your worst hands. You don‚Äôt have to keep betting because you ‚Äúshowed strength preflop‚Äù or ‚Äúcan represent a big pair.‚Äù Those are reasons to have a bluffing range, but on a flop like this, you will have no shortage of weak hands to choose from. Better to choose something with at least a backdoor draw, and even then, it won‚Äôt be optimal to bet every time.
Two unlucky things have happened since you put in that fourth bet before the flop with no pair:
Your opponent didn‚Äôt fold, which would have been your preferred outcome.
You got an unlucky flop that didn‚Äôt help your hand and didn‚Äôt even give you much to represent through your range. In such cases, you are better off cutting your losses than throwing good money after bad.
If you did flop well, then you can flip a coin. That‚Äôs about the right betting frequency for the overpairs, anyway. With draws (including backdoor draws), you‚Äôd ideally generate a random number that gives you a somewhat lower betting frequency.
Note that these should be half-pot bets, if you‚Äôre betting at all. As usual, a lower betting frequency correlates with a more polar range and relatively larger sizes. It‚Äôs easy to see how that will benefit your overpairs, which are strong enough to play a big pot on the flop (yes, the solver calls a shove with all of them, including with some weaker hands as well) but could easily lose their value on the turn.
Low, Dry Flop
933tt is not as obviously bad a flop as 765r. It might even seem like a flop that should ‚Äúbelong‚Äù to the 4-bettor, who can represent big pairs when they don‚Äôt have them.
And this is, in fact, a reasonably good flop for the CO. Even though they have a bit less than half the equity, they have a bit more than half the EV:
Range metrics on 933tt: CO (left), BTN (right)
It‚Äôs rare to see OOP over-realize their equity. In this scenario, the low SPR mitigates their positional disadvantage, and they do enjoy a significant nuts advantage (QQ are effectively the nuts here). However, this does not translate into an especially high c-betting frequency:
CO (4-bettor) c-bet flop strategy vs BTN on 933tt: 200bb starting
Recall that with 200bb, CO is actually not 4-betting all that many big pairs, mostly just QQ or better. So, they can‚Äôt just blast away whenever they flop trash. As on 765r, strong pairs and strong draws bet most consistently, and the very worst hands, stuff like 6‚ô†5‚ô† and A‚ô£5‚ô£, which lack both strong backdoor draws and even good pair outs, purely check.
You can bet more often on this flop than on 765r, but you‚Äôre still betting polar and for the half-pot size when you bet. Stacking off to a shove over that bet is fairly intuitive‚Äîit‚Äôs mostly big pairs and flush draws, but good overcards with a backdoor draw also belong in that range. That means stuff like A‚ô¶K‚ô¶ and A‚ô†J‚ô•, which may not be as intuitive.
Conclusion
Playing 4-bet pots well starts with building a strong foundation on early streets by betting and raising the right ranges. This is true of all situations in poker, but it is especially true of 4-bet pots, where such a large percentage of the stack is already committed before the flop.
Deeper stacks incentivize you to 4-bet a more diverse and polar range from OOP than you would 100bb stacks, where you mostly just choose hands with a lot of equity. The decision of how frequently to bet at various flops follows directly from the shape of this range.
Ace- and King-high flops (and sometimes Queen-high, depending on your position) connect well with your 4-betting range, and you can bet small at a high frequency just as you would in a 100bb scenario.
On lower flops, even those that are not obviously bad for you, you should not put up a fight with your worst hands. This incentivizes you to also check your stronger hands at a reasonable frequency, as your opponent should stab more often at these flops.
### TOPIC: overbetting flop
Overbetting The Flop in Cash Games
Although most commonly analyzed on turns and rivers, flop overbetting can be a devastating weapon that generates massive amounts of EV at equilibrium while also having tremendous exploitative merit.
This article will equip you with the tools to build out polarized flop strategies. Please note that this article is aimed towards advanced players, so if you‚Äôre relatively new to poker, I would highly recommend reading this article on flop c-betting first.

Why Does GTO Overbet the Flop?
To understand why GTO might opt to overbet the flop, we should familiarize ourselves with the concepts of Nut Advantage and Urgency.

What is Nut Advantage?
Nut advantage is when you have proportionally more strong hands at the top of your range than your opponent. While a nut advantage does not directly lead to an overbetting strategy, it‚Äôs rare to see an overbet placed by a player at a nut disadvantage.
A player with a nut advantage has incentive to get their stack in. The reason why is simple; it places the top of one player‚Äôs range against the top of another‚Äôs. As more and more money goes into the pot, ranges get tighter and tighter. The player with the nut advantage will win this matchup more often. Overbetting is a powerful tool for achieving this goal.

What is Urgency?
‚ÄúUrgency‚Äù, sometimes called ‚ÄúHaste‚Äù, refers to when you have an extremely strong hand now, but one that may not be as strong on later streets.
An example of this is opening the BTN with JJ, getting called by the BB, and seeing a flop of T85 Rainbow. On this flop, JJ is currently ahead of 97% of the opponent‚Äôs range but only has 79.6% equity. This gives the JJ urgency to build the pot quickly before any overcards or draws allow our opponent to catch up.
Lessons in Overbetting The Flop
This next section aims to use what we‚Äôve learned in some of the most common flop overbet spots. First, we‚Äôll take a look at a few different categories of flop that are frequently overbet. Next, we‚Äôll discuss topics like hand elasticity, which can help us understand why the solver may choose to use an overbet.

Double Broadway Overbets
Double Broadway boards are relatively common. By filtering for this board type, we find that the overbet is often the predominant strategy.
The overbet is employed because these boards:
Give us a large nut advantage as the PFR.
Many draws exist, but none have completed yet, motivating us to build the pot with our nuttish holdings as quickly as possible.
Let‚Äôs investigate some more Double-Broadway boards!
When looking at flop strategies, it‚Äôs useful to compare Two-Tone and Rainbow boards, as there can be considerable differences between their strategies.
By comparing these two flops side by side, we can directly compare the effects of urgency. On both of these flops, the PFR has a large nut advantage, but the flush draw version causes them to size up and bet less often. The reason for this is unsurprising: We are more prone to getting outdrawn, so we should size up to get value now rather than later.
This also explains why overbets do not happen on boards like K72:
Despite having a huge nut advantage, rather than build our flop strategy around nutted hands, we prefer to build it around bluffs. Our opponent‚Äôs range has a lot of inelastic folds‚Äîhands so hopeless that they have to fold to any bet‚Äîso we prefer to take advantage of this by betting the flop smaller and risking less with our bluffs.
We don‚Äôt have to worry about losing value when doing this; most turns and rivers are clean, so we can simply incorporate overbets on later streets to get the money in. The flop is built around bluffs; the turn and the river are built around our nuttish holdings.

Middling Board Overbets
A common misconception is that flop overbets only happen on high card boards. When viewed from a surface level, you‚Äôd be forgiven for believing this myth. The preflop caller does pair more often on a 973r flop than the preflop raiser after all. And yet‚Ä¶
If the preflop caller has more pairs in range than us, why would we still choose to overbet?
The answer comes down to the quality of the pairs! Despite having fewer pairs in range overall, the BTN has a monopoly on all of the overpairs. Due to the complete lack of possible two pairs and straights on this board, any overpair is essentially the nuts.
Nut Advantage + Draw Heavy Board = Urgency ‚Üí Leading to Big Bets
Since we‚Äôve already explored the concept of urgency leading to overbets, let‚Äôs now explore the concept of hand elasticity and how it relates to flop strategy.

What is Elasticity?
Elasticity refers to how prone a hand is to altering its action facing various bet sizes.
Looking at the charts above, we can determine which hands are elastic and which hands aren‚Äôt.
44 is an elastic hand. Facing the small 33% pot bet, it should always call. It can start mixing folds against 50% pot and should mostly fold against 75% pot. Against the overbet, the hand can no longer continue. K7s and Q2s are both examples of inelastic hands. Q2s must always fold no matter the bet size, while K7s should continue up to around 150% pot.
Entire ranges can be thought of in terms of elasticity; the more elastic hands a range has, the more it can adapt to pricing, including larger bet sizes. Elasticity is related to the concepts of indifference and hand targeting.
Thinking back to Double-Broadway boards, hands like 98s are already close to 0 EV on the flop, so there isn‚Äôt a point in folding them out. So instead, we use a large bet to target hands like QJ, QT, JT, and Kx force them into indifference.

Overbetting IP against SB Flats
Most players play the same way against the SB as the BB, this is a mistake! And one doesn‚Äôt have to look much further than low paired flops to see this.
Not exactly a 33% pot range-bet! Why?
The SB caller has significantly worse pot odds than the BB to enter the pot, and risks being squeezed as well. The result is a flatting range consisting of mostly pocket pairs and suited broadway holdings.
Since this range is pocket pair heavy and devoid of trash, the SB will almost always have an equity advantage over the IP player on low boards.
Comparing the EVs between the SB and PFR, we find something interesting. Despite the SB having the equity advantage, the PFR actually has the overall EV advantage. As we should come to expect at this point, Nut Advantage is the culprit. Understanding why the overbet is the most effective strategy is fairly intuitive when we look at the SB‚Äôs response facing it.
The overbet perfectly targets pocket pairs and strong Ace high! Look at all the indifferent hands! The ELASTICITY!
The SB‚Äôs range is already condensed preflop, so a small bet simply doesn‚Äôt achieve much. At risk of overkill, compare the sheer difference in fold equity that the small bet has against the SB‚Äôs range opposed to the BB‚Äôs.
20% less folding!

Overbetting When Checked to as the IP Preflop Caller
Our final spot is a black sheep in that we are overbetting as the PFC. In this section, we‚Äôll focus on HJ vs. BTN SRPs, but similar principles apply to most IP PFC spots, including blind-vs-blind spots.
Like the SB flatting range, the BTN‚Äôs range consists of mostly pocket pairs and suited broadway holdings.
When checked to on low boards, our strategy mainly consists of high frequency small bets. This makes sense as our pocket pairs have incentive to deny equity from overcards, and a small bet best attacks these holdings. We can always size up on later streets with our nuttish hands as needed.
On Ace-High boards, overbetting is the predominant strategy, and nowhere is this more pronounced than Ace-Low-Low boards.
We actually have the Nut Advantage on these boards because of our sets and two pairs!
The overbet serves to make the HJ‚Äôs Ax and under-pairs indifferent on the flop. Now that‚Äôs targeting!

Conclusion
In conclusion, mastering the art of overbetting on the flop can be a formidable strategy that gives you an edge over your competitors. In this article, we have examined different scenarios where you can utilize devastating overbets to crush your opponents.
When contemplating a flop overbet, three crucial factors should be taken into account:
Nut advantage ‚Äì Determine who possesses a higher proportion of strong, premium hands within their range.
Urgency ‚Äì Strong but vulnerable holdings have more incentive to build the pot immediately.

Attacking Aggressive Opponents When They Check Back Flop
Playing out of position (OOP) is hard. Playing out of position against an aggressive opponent is even harder, as it worsens an already relatively impaired ability to realize equity because they‚Äôre often putting you to the test. What happens, then, when they decide not to bet?
Our Villain
Meet Aggro Andy; he‚Äôs a Tight-Aggressive player who likes to put maximum pressure on his opponents. He often defaults to playing the specific hand he‚Äôs holding by looking for reasons to bet rather than considering how it fits into his range as a whole. Andy tends to do pretty well at low stakes, as decisions for a lot of chips lead to big mistakes by his unstudied opponents. And his tighter nature restrains him from firing away chips with pure air too often.
One of the reasons it can often feel difficult to play against Andy is that he actually gains EV when he bets compared to theory, despite playing an imbalanced strategy. Let‚Äôs review an example to understand why and how we recapture EV when he checks.
How EV Moves
To demonstrate why attacking Andy‚Äôs checks is important, we first need to understand what‚Äôs happening in theory when he bets too often. Our example scenario throughout this article will be a BB vs BTN single-raised 100bb cash game pot (SRP) on a flop of K‚ô¶9‚ô†7‚ô†. We will sit in as the Big Blind while Andy plays on the Button.
BTN c-bet flop strategy on K97tt vs BB, 100bb effective
In the AI-solved solution, Andy is meant to check almost 42% of his top pairs on the flop. These are mostly weaker top pairs with no flush draw. He‚Äôs even supposed to check AK some of the time!
Not understanding how to punish an opponent‚Äôs imbalanced strategy can allow them to enjoy its upsides without its downsides, resulting in a net gain for Villain, and a net loss for Hero.
If, instead, we nodelock all of his top pair and better to bet, we see something interesting happen:
Theory EV when BTN c-bets (right-side)
Nodelocked EV when Andy on the BTN c-bets (right)
Andy‚Äôs EV when he bets actually increases! In this case, by a massive amount of +16bb/100. The reason for this is fairly intuitive; he strengthened his betting range by injecting more equity, and a stronger range (usually) means more EV. Even against a perfect response from the Big Blind, Andy has gained quite a lot of EV when he does bet. But if we go back to what his EV looks like for his entire range‚Ä¶
Theory EV on the flop
Nodelocked EV on the flop
Andy has lost EV to the tune of -6bb/100. If Andy gained EV in the betting line but lost EV overall, there‚Äôs only one place to find the missing EV: in the checking line. This is why it‚Äôs so important to understand how to attack Andy‚Äôs checks; if you don‚Äôt, his imbalanced strategy will only ever be an upside.
Nuances in Aggression
There are multiple ways to be betting too often; we‚Äôll cover the two main possibilities and how they affect our exploits.
Betting Too Often With Value
If you‚Äôve spent time watching or reading poker study material, you‚Äôve likely heard about the concept of ‚Äúprotecting your checking range.‚Äù The idea is that if you always bet your value, you leave yourself overly vulnerable when you check. This is the simplest way that our opponents create imbalances in their game.
Returning to the above example, where we forced the IP Villain to always bet with top pair or better, they almost always lose the equity advantage when they check, except for an Ace reintroducing top pair combinations into their range.
When To Exploit
So, which turn cards are best for us, as OOP, when we face a check from an IP opponent we know won‚Äôt have strong hands‚Äîin this case, top pair or better?
Comparison of OOP‚Äôs EVs on different turn cards vs value-light flop check backs
A trend begins to appear; while we gain significant EV on every turn, the biggest difference comes from cards that do not reintroduce strong hands into the opponent‚Äôs range. In this example, that means brick cards that don‚Äôt complete any draws or that pair the King that‚Äôs on the board. Even the 5‚ô†, a rare turn that gives OOP the equity lead in the GTO solution, is not as good as these brick turns.
How To Exploit
Now that we have an idea about which turns we should attack the most, how do we actually go about designing a strategy that accomplishes this?
Something that‚Äôs consistent across almost all turn cards is that OOP gets to use much larger bet sizings than in theory and with a much higher frequency. In fact, except for turns that uncap IP‚Äôs range, OOP usually uses pot size or even overbets; when an offsuit King pairs the board, OOP begins to use 253% lead overbets with a massive 41% of their range.
BB first in turn strategy on K‚ô¶9‚ô†7‚ô† K‚ô• vs imbalanced flop checking BTN
Furthermore, we can bet even more frequently if we expect our opponent to over-fold even slightly (e.g., 4% over-fold) to our bets, which isn‚Äôt hard to imagine in this case; all our opponent has to do is fold 88 and open-ended straight draws without a corresponding flush draw, and our betting percentage shoots up to 62%, mostly concentrated around King-x for value, while we use nearly every single draw in our range and even a good amount of unpaired hands without a draw as bluffs.
BB first in turn strategy on K‚ô¶9‚ô†7‚ô† K‚ô• vs imbalanced flop checking BTN (who will over-fold turn)
When aggressive opponents whose betting ranges are too value-heavy cap themselves on the flop by checking, we can often push that advantage much further than we might intuit, and recapture lots of EV in the process.
Betting Too Often With Draws
Of the possibilities for players who bet too often, betting too frequently with draws is likely the more common archetype found at low-to-mid stakes. Many players understand that they need to check back some strong hands and middling value, particularly on the flop, when many such hands cannot bet three streets for value.
However, aggressive opponents often have a much more difficult time checking back draws, as betting allows them to win the pot without having to hit their draw at all. Against this type of opponent, the turn cards that benefit us are much different! Nodelocking IP to bet all of their flush draws and many of their straight draws, we see a very different outcome compared to an opponent who bet too much with value:
BTN nodelocked (too aggro with draws) c-bet flop strategy
When To Exploit
Comparison of OOP‚Äôs EVs on different turn cards vs draw-light flop check backs
There are two major takeaways here:
The best turn cards for OOP are almost flipped on their heads (compared to the first spot, where aggression = value-heavy). Instead of bricks being good, we are now happy to see the board change, as we retain all of our draws from the flop while IP lost most of them. The main exception among these examples is the 9‚ô•, which remains a pretty bad card to attack the Button‚Äôs checking range. This is because they didn‚Äôt remove a significant portion of value by checking, but still concentrated a higher percentage of their checking range around second pair (now trips) by betting draws too often on the flop. This effect is mirrored with the A‚ô•, though BTN did remove some Ace-high combinations from their range by betting their Ace-high flush draws.
IP is not losing as much EV when they check across all turns as they were in our first example. The reason for this is twofold. Firstly, BTN simply has a stronger range than in the first example; their checking range is protected by the medium and strong value hands that checked back. Additionally, the turns that benefit OOP are more infrequent; the BB‚Äôs range must now improve in a specific way to attack the BTN‚Äôs check rather than being stronger by default.
How To Exploit
When draws do complete, however, we attack in much the same way as we did in the previous example. In the unlocked (GTO) solution, BB is meant to have small leads (40% pot) on the flush-completing 2‚ô†.
BB first in turn strategy on K‚ô¶9‚ô†7‚ô† 2‚ô† vs balanced flop checking BTN
But when the BTN is betting all of their flush draws on the flop, the nodelocked solution has BB instead implement massive overbet leads (253% pot) at close to the same frequency as was previously used for the small leads. This drastic change in bet size is possible because the BTN stripped themselves of all of their turned flushes when they decided to check, meaning OOP suddenly obtained a hefty nut advantage.
BB first in turn strategy vs imbalanced flop checking BTN
And once again, if we force IP to under-defend just slightly (4%) by folding some underpair and second pair combinations, this frequency rockets to almost 61% of our range.
BB first in turn strategy vs imbalanced flop checking BTN (who will over-fold turn)
Conclusion
The most critical thing to understand is that an imbalanced strategy will produce scenarios where our opponent is too weak. These parts of the game tree are where they can lose EV. But they only will lose it if you attack properly to seize that EV.
However, identifying these scenarios can be tricky, as identical runouts can produce very different outcomes depending on how our opponent is imbalanced. While it‚Äôs impossible to know a real-life opponent‚Äôs exact strategy, understanding their tendencies is an important factor in knowing when these scenarios appear.
Next time your local ‚ÄúAndy‚Äù decides to check back the flop, ask yourself how strong his range can actually be; you may be surprised to find just how often you can turn the tables on an otherwise tough opponent.
### TOPIC: playing nuts deep stacked
Maximizing Monsters in Deep-Stacked Scenarios
With a monster hand, you‚Äôre virtually guaranteed to win the pot, so the question of just how big a pot you win can feel secondary.
But don‚Äôt get complacent! The question of how big matters enormously, especially when you‚Äôre playing with 200bb+ stacks.
Deep-stacked No Limit Hold ‚Äòem is a game of big pots. Really big pots. Failing to make the most of a monster hand is a much bigger mistake than a bad preflop call, but it doesn‚Äôt always feel like a mistake when the pot is getting pushed to you.
After all, you won a pretty big pot. Maybe you won 50 or 100bb, several hours‚Äô worth of win rate. Feels good, right?
Failing to make the most of a monster hand is a much bigger mistake than a bad preflop call.
For an elite poker player, no pot is ‚Äúbig enough.‚Äù You can never afford to rest on your laurels. Even when that big pot is getting pushed to you, you should be asking yourself, ‚ÄúCould it have been bigger?‚Äù It feels great to win 100bb. But if there‚Äôs 100bb still in the effective stack, that‚Äôs 100bb you‚Äôre missing out on.
Of course, you can‚Äôt win it all with your monsters every time. But if a different line could have won that last 100bb, then you made an enormous mistake. That alternative line doesn‚Äôt have to result in you winning the other 100bb anywhere near 100% of the time to be the superior line, since the payoff is so big the times it does work out.
It pays to get ambitious and consider all your options before you settle for ‚Äúbig enough,‚Äù so let‚Äôs consider those options now‚Ä¶

Geometric Betting
Geometric betting‚Äîwhere you bet the same fraction of the pot on each remaining street such that the final bet is all-in‚Äîis a robust default option. It‚Äôs the best way to bet the nuts in a toy game where there‚Äôs no card removal and hands never change value, and it‚Äôs a strong contender for how best to play the nuts in many real poker situations as well.
With 200bb on a static flop like AK7r, the solver recommends quite a lot of geometric continuation betting, even though it‚Äôs a significant overbet. This is from a BB vs BTN single-raised pot (SRP), but this holds true for SRP configurations where the preflop raiser is in other positions:
BTN c-bet flop strategy for range vs BB on AK7r: 200bb starting stacks
In fact, it will bet even larger than geometric when given the opportunity, though this does not meaningfully affect the EV.
The point is, when you‚Äôre deep, it‚Äôs worth considering some really big bets as early as the flop, especially when the flop is one that gives you such a significant nuts advantage.
We will use this flop as an example of how to play monster hands on static boards where you have a significant nuts advantage. On more dynamic boards, it is harder to generalize because what counts as a nut hand is likely to change from street to street.

Other Options
That said, geometric betting and overbetting, in general, are not essential on the flop. In our AK7r example, the solver mixes checks and smaller bets with its monster hands. In fact, with the literal nuts, it almost never overbets:
BTN c-bet flop strategy per hand vs BB on AK7r
A strategy of c-betting quarter pot with your entire range loses just .02bb in theory and is much simpler to execute. The flop in general is quite forgiving of bet size choices, provided you make up the difference later.
Let‚Äôs get into the details of how you make up the difference later.

Compensating for a Small Flop Bet
For this example, we‚Äôre going to assume you went for the simple strategy of range-betting small on the flop, though it wouldn‚Äôt make that much of a difference provided your ranges were properly balanced. Small bets are a more appealing means of slow-playing monsters than checking is, because even a small bet on the flop facilitates less dramatic overbetting on later streets and re-opens the action for your opponent to raise.
Inducing a check/raise is your best-case scenario when you bet small with a monster. Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt expect it often on a board like this. At such a high SPR, BB flops very few hands with which they are eager to play for stacks. This means they have few value check/raises and even fewer bluffs. The solver check/raises less than 7% of the time, preferring a large size:
BB response vs BTN‚Äôs 25% pot c-bet: custom solution (BTN‚Äôs options = X or B25)
In position on a static board against what ought to be a polar range, there‚Äôs no need to raise. Even against a smaller raise, 3-betting is not terribly appealing, though it is worth considering with your monsters:
BTN response vs BB‚Äôs small (33% pot) check/raise
If you do call, you‚Äôre likely to face a turn bet, and at that point, you should strongly consider raising your monsters. Even on a very blank turn like 5‚ô£, BTN‚Äôs strongest hands raise quite consistently.
Raising is even more important on a coordinated turn like the 8‚ô¶, which introduces several new draws:
The concern is not just that you may get drawn out on but that a scary river card could discourage further action from hands with which your opponent is currently ready to go the distance with.
This is a geometric raise, setting up a 128% pot shove on the river. Remember what we said on the flop:
It‚Äôs ok to c-bet small with your monsters as long as you make up the difference later.
It‚Äôs later! With the board getting more coordinated and your opponent continuing to show interest, it‚Äôs time to reel in your fish before it wriggles off the hook.
We see this even more dramatically if your opponent just calls your flop bet. Assuming they check to you on the turn, it‚Äôs time to back up the truck and start offloading those chips into the pot, and with so much remaining to be wagered, these bets need to be large. Geometric is roughly 3x pot, and that‚Äôs the solver‚Äôs most used size:
BTN double barrel strategy on blank turn (after flop went X-B25-C)

Compensating for a Turn Check
The exceptions here, which mix some checks, are mostly AA and A5, which block many of the hands likely to give you action. When you check these, you are resigning yourself to not winning a very large pot with your monster hand. Even facing a 66% pot bet on a blank river, the solver‚Äôs raise isn‚Äôt putting anywhere near the full stacks in:
BTN response vs BB‚Äôs 66% pot probe-bet on blank river
This very passive line targets weaker hands in BB‚Äôs range, which isn‚Äôt generally what you want to do with your monsters. It makes sense in these cases only because, when you‚Äôre holding two of the Aces and one on the board, you are unlikely to get big bets paid off anyway. Even then, the solver does not expect this less ambitious line to outperform geometric betting (on turn and river), only to be competitive with it.

Compensating for a Flop Check
AA is also a candidate for checking the flop if you choose to use the lower-frequency, polar c-betting strategy. If you‚Äôre lucky, you‚Äôll face an overbet on the turn, in which case you should abandon the pretense of slow-playing and start reeling in what‚Äôs on your hook with a geometric raise:
BTN response vs BB‚Äôs 158% pot probe-bet on blank turn
Aces never slow-plays against this bet. Interestingly, it is turned bottom set that sometimes just calls (BTN never checks Kings or Sevens on the flop). On many rivers, a set of Fives will be borderline not strong enough to raise another overbet:
BTN response vs BB‚Äôs 125% pot bet on blank river

Facing a Turn Check
More commonly, your opponent will check to you a second time on the turn. When that happens, it plays out similarly to the line where you c-bet small on the flop and check the turn: your opponent has shown no interest in the pot, so you‚Äôre mostly settling for winning a small pot from your opponent‚Äôs weaker hands rather than shooting for the stars.
This is especially true when you block strong hands. On a 5‚ô£ turn, BTN overbets a set of Fives (but stops short of geometric betting) but mostly checks again with a set of Aces:
BTN delayed c-bet strategy on blank turn
There‚Äôs a stronger case for betting a more coordinated turn, but even then, Aces sometimes continues slow-playing:
BTN delayed c-bet strategy on wet turn

Compensating for Two Checks
You‚Äôre holding a monster, the pot is tiny, and you‚Äôve got just one opportunity remaining to bet. Unfortunately, your opponent has repeatedly declined to show interest in the pot, so you can‚Äôt get too ambitious. Aces mixes between 65% and 125% pot:
BTN double-delayed c-bet on blank river
At this point, your blockers aren‚Äôt really working against you anymore. An opponent who checks all three streets is unlikely to hold top pair anyway, so a set of Aces plays just like any pair of Aces, betting an amount that can get picked off by lower pairs.

Conclusion
Winning big pots with your big hands is essential to your win rate, especially in deep-stacked poker, where the difference between ‚Äúbig enough‚Äù and ‚Äúthe maximum‚Äù can be as great as the difference between ‚Äúthe maximum‚Äù and ‚Äúthe minimum‚Äù in a 100bb game.
When you have the nuts advantage, it‚Äôs mostly on you to grow the pot, and the most reliable way to do that is with geometric betting.
Geometric betting is not the only option, however. Especially on the flop, you can create deception and/or simplify your strategy without loss of EV as long as you make up the difference later.
The purpose of slow-playing is to give your opponent the opportunity to develop a hand they are interested in. Once they show interest, that‚Äôs your signal to change gears and start reeling them in with geometric bets and raises.
Even if they don‚Äôt show interest, you should seriously consider a geometric bet on the turn, no matter how large. If they fold, you probably wouldn‚Äôt have won much anyway. When the reward for winning the maximum is so large, that reward is worth pursuing at the expense of missing out on the occasional smaller bet from weaker hands.
The only time extreme, multi-street slow-playing really makes sense is when your opponent shows no interest in the pot and you block a lot of the hands likely to pay off large bets. In those cases, you resign yourself to the likelihood that your opponent is so unlikely to pay off large bets that it makes sense to hunt for smaller game with less ambitious bets.
### TOPIC: playing river
We‚Äôre At The River. Our Hand Can‚Äôt Win. Now What?
You‚Äôre in a heads-up pot and you‚Äôve made it to the river. Your opponent has check/called two streets, so you‚Äôre relatively confident their range is at least somewhat capped. There‚Äôs just one problem; you have a really weak hand that can‚Äôt win the pot without bluffing.
How do you figure out whether you should bluff or give up, when you have no information about how your opponent plays?
While this can be a very tricky spot to navigate, especially in larger pots, there are plenty of theoretical concepts we can call upon to help us with this kind of decision. Let‚Äôs explore a few of the most important things we should be keeping in mind when we arrive at the river with a potential bluffing candidate.
Theoretical concerns:
Showdown value
Blockers
Unblockers
Frequencies
Showdown Value
First and foremost, we have to evaluate whether the idea that our hand can‚Äôt win at showdown is actually accurate. After all, there are plenty of scenarios where a hand that was bluffing on one or even both previous streets still has 5%, 10%, or even 20% equity once the river rolls off.
Example
Take this spot as an example‚Äîit‚Äôs based on a recent online hand I played. It‚Äôs an MTT spot where we open A‚ô¶K‚ô† from the LJ at an 8-handed table and get called by the SB, with effective stacks of roughly 30bb. I‚Äôve used Chip EV ranges here, just to illustrate the principles at work.
The flop comes T43 with two clubs, villain checks, we c-bet 40% pot, and villain calls. The turn is an offsuit Queen, villain checks, and we bet again for a roughly geometric size of around 70% pot. villain calls, and the river comes an offsuit 7.
The postflop action
We could think about bluffing here, given that we only have Ace-high, and we can put a lot of pressure on a hand like JTs or T9s, which would be a pure bluff-catcher here. However, before we bluff with this hand (and remember, in theory, bluffing the river is usually a 0EV proposition unless we have some very important blockers), we should make sure to evaluate whether it‚Äôs possible we can actually win at showdown because:
If we know that checking makes money, then making a theoretically break-even bluff on the river is actually a bad play.
LJ‚Äôs river strategy with AKo vs SB
As you can see here, any combo of AKo that reaches the river in this line wins 21%‚Äì30% of the pot by checking, given that we beat all of villain‚Äôs missed flush draws and combo draws. So, even though bluff-shoving would be winning around 15% of the pot at the bare minimum here, that‚Äôs not enough to justify actually making the play.
If we‚Äôre going to make sure we have enough bluffs here to keep villain indifferent, which is what we should be doing in theory, then there‚Äôs no reason to take a hand that can sometimes win at showdown and use it as a bluff. We may as well use hands that never win at showdown instead, and this way we‚Äôre not giving up whatever percentage of the pot we might be winning if we check.
LJ‚Äôs river strategy with 98s vs SB
By contrast, here‚Äôs a look at the EV of betting vs checking when we have 98s‚Äîclearly, this is a big difference. While minor card removal
factors related to the turn being the Q‚ô• do make 9‚ô¶8‚ô¶ a better bluff than 9‚ô•8‚ô• here, we‚Äôre bluffing 9‚ô•8‚ô• 100% of the time, even though it‚Äôs only winning 8.6% of the pot by doing so. This is specifically because we‚Äôre only making 2% of the pot if we check since it‚Äôs so difficult for the villain to ever have worse than 9-high.
Of course, there are plenty of spots where even Ace-high has no showdown value at all, based on the nature of the board texture and the opponent‚Äôs range for continuing beyond the turn; in those spots, bluffing the river with Ace-high will usually be a much more reasonable proposition. But you‚Äôd be surprised how many errors players will make by bluffing with hands that simply don‚Äôt need to bluff in order to sometimes be able to win.
Blockers and Unblockers
A lot is made of the significance of blockers within poker strategy, and in many cases, they‚Äôre not as meaningful as you might think, but bluffing the river is one instance where it is important to be mindful of each individual hand‚Äôs blocking and unblocking properties.
As a rule of thumb, if we‚Äôre planning to bluff the river, we want our hand to do two things:
Block at least some of the hands our opponent is likely to call with
Unblock as many folding hands as possible, or in other words, not blocking any of the folding range
While it‚Äôs not easy to find spots where a hand does both of these, it does occur surprisingly often, and these are spots where we should make sure we pull the trigger on bluffs.
There are also plenty of spots where our hand will be able to do one of the above, but not the other, and bluffing with these hands is generally going to be pretty reasonable as well.
The spots we want to avoid, however, are the ones where our hand does neither of the two things we want‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt block any calling hands, and it actually does block some of our opponent‚Äôs folding range.
In these spots, our bluff is significantly less likely to get through. The best way to explore these spots with GTO Wizard is by using the ‚ÄúBlockers‚Äù tab in the analysis section of a sim. The first clues can be found in the ‚ÄúHands‚Äù tab however. Let‚Äôs go back to our previous example so I can show you what I mean.
LJ‚Äôs river strategy with AKo vs SB
Here are all of our AKo combos from the spot we were looking at before. The blocker scores are represented in the top-left of each rectangle, next to the hands themselves. The left number is the value removal, while the right one is the trash removal.
Value Removal Score
When using these scores to guide us, it‚Äôs important to note that since value removal only really refers to the top portion of our opponent‚Äôs range and not their bluff-catchers, most of our bluffing candidates in many spots will have relatively low value removal scores. Even a 2 or a 3 can be a significant factor in some scenarios. All the AKo combos have a 1 in this particular spot because they don‚Äôt block any two pairs, sets, or straights.
Trash Removal Score
However, the trash removal scores are going to vary significantly, depending on certain hands‚Äô interaction with all the weakest combos in our opponent‚Äôs range. In this particular spot, a combo like A‚ô¶K‚ô† doesn‚Äôt block any of the weakest hands in villain‚Äôs range, which are mostly missed flush draws, so it has a 1 for trash removal; something like A‚ô£K‚ô•, though, has a 6 for trash removal, because the A‚ô£ blocks all the missed nut flush draws.
When In-Game
We can‚Äôt necessarily expect ourselves to calculate these removal scores in a precise way in-game, but looking at the scores in the sims we study away from the tables helps us to acknowledge why a certain hand might be choosing whether or not to bluff in a specific spot. This process cultivates the intuition that we rely upon when sitting at a table where it‚Äôs brain vs brain.
Frequencies
Our final theoretical concern in these spots is our overall bluffing frequency. While we won‚Äôt always be up against opponents who are capable of recognizing whether we‚Äôre over-bluffing or under-bluffing, we do have to be mindful of:
The information we convey to everyone else at the table when hands go to showdown.
The way our bluffing choices on the river will affect the way our opponents perceive us over time.
If we automatically bluff the river with every possible bluffing candidate, we‚Äôre likely going to end up over-bluffing, which may actually be a short-term benefit in many spots, but could leave us open to a very obvious counterexploit by any competent and attentive opponent at the table‚Äîthey simply stop folding their bluff-catchers. Conversely, if we don‚Äôt bluff the river even with our best candidates, those competent opponents can make the inverse adjustment relatively easily; folding to our river-bets more often.
While it might be tempting to dive down the rabbit hole of deliberately trying to influence our opponents‚Äô future adaptations with our current actions, it‚Äôs a very difficult dynamic to navigate; we can‚Äôt always be particularly confident of the exact adaptations our opponents will make, or when those adaptations will occur. The way we extract ourselves from this complicated leveling war is by ensuring that we don‚Äôt overly commit to over-bluffing or under-bluffing exploitatively until we have a high level of confidence in our opponent‚Äôs tendencies. And the way we do that is by having a baseline notion of what our give-up hands are in any given spot, using the principles we‚Äôve already discussed.
If we arrive at the river with a poor bluffing candidate‚Äîwhich blocks some of our opponent‚Äôs folding range, doesn‚Äôt block any of their calling range, and/or has some showdown value‚Äîchecking is likely to be a very good option.
But what happens when we‚Äôre simply not sure whether our hand has the right properties or not? After all, some spots are very complex.
Well, ultimately, if we want to moderate the frequencies in a way that makes sense, we can usually default to one simple protocol:
The hands with the least showdown value are more likely to want to bluff.
If we have a choice between bluffing the river with Ace-high or 9-high, and we‚Äôre not sure which of the two has the right blocking and unblocking properties, we would prefer to bluff the 9-high and check the Ace-high, simply because we can be more confident that we‚Äôre not wasting any showdown value.
Conclusion
In short, we can follow one fairly simple maxim:
If you arrive at the river and can‚Äôt easily identify any better bluffing candidates or weaker showdown value hands in your range than your current hand, your current hand will probably serve decently well as a bluff.
This will help you moderate your bluffing frequencies to some degree and make it less likely you‚Äôre going to end up with literally no bluffs at all in any specific scenario.

### TOPIC: poker combinatorics
A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Poker Combinatorics
Combinatorics is a fancy term for evaluating the number of possible ‚Äúcombinations‚Äù (combos) of any given hand: the combination of 2 cards of certain ranks and suits. It allows us to answer questions like how many different versions of AK you can hold in a specific spot, what hands make for better bluff-catchers and many more.
Combo Counting Basics
The Hand Matrix
There are 1326 possible combinations of starting hands in Texas Hold‚ÄôEm. They are frequently represented by a grid that is commonly referred to as a hand matrix.
Simply looking at the hand matrix, it would be easy to mistakenly assume that pocket pairs comprise 13/169 of possible hands and suited and offsuit hands each make up 78/169. By looking at the grid and summing the squares that correspond to each hand class we would arrive at the aforementioned answer. However, this relies on all squares being equal to each other. Despite this being the case geometrically, it is not the case combinatorically.
There are in fact:
6 combos of each pocket pair
A‚ô†A‚ô•, A‚ô†A‚ô¶, A‚ô†A‚ô£, A‚ô•A‚ô¶, A‚ô•A‚ô£, A‚ô¶A‚ô£
4 combos of each suited hand
A‚ô†K‚ô†, A‚ô•K‚ô•, A‚ô¶K‚ô¶, A‚ô£K‚ô£
12 combos of each unpaired, offsuit hand
A‚ô†K‚ô•, A‚ô†K‚ô¶, A‚ô†K‚ô£, A‚ô•K‚ô†, A‚ô•K‚ô¶, A‚ô•K‚ô£, A‚ô¶K‚ô†, A‚ô¶K‚ô•, A‚ô¶K‚ô£, A‚ô£K‚ô†, A‚ô£K‚ô•, A‚ô£K‚ô¶
This leads us to the conclusion that there are 78 pocket pairs (6 combos times 13 squares), 312 suited hands (4 combos times 78 squares) and 936 unpaired, offsuit hands (12 combos times 78 squares).

The above ratios are applicable preflop but falter when in the presence of ‚Äúdead cards‚Äù. Dead cards refer to cards that are known to not be in a player‚Äôs hand. The most common example occurs when a flop is dealt. The flop cards are dead as it is impossible for any player to hold them.
The simplest way to count combinations is to multiply the number of unseen cards. Let‚Äôs go over some examples to familiarize you:
BTN opens, BB calls, flop is AK2:
How many combinations of AQ does the BTN have?

How many combinations of AA does the BTN have?
How many combinations of AKs does the BTN have?
Other Card Removal Examples
Dead cards exist when public information makes certain hands impossible to hold. There exist other, more subtle versions of card removal, however. One notable version is blockers. This is when one player uses the private information provided by their hand, or private dead cards if you will, to combinatorically narrow their opponent‚Äôs range.
Simple Blocker Example
Blockers are a vital part of poker strategy that can make or break close decisions. By eliminating specific combos from players‚Äô ranges, you can shift their action frequencies and value to bluff ratios.
Let‚Äôs examine a simple example where we can make use of this effect:
üé≤ [6Max Cash, 500NL, 100BB]
BTN opens to 2.5BB and BB defends. BB check-calls a 33% flop c-bet, a 125% turn c-bet and faces an 85% river c-bet on J‚ô†5‚ô•2‚ô†K‚ô¶8‚ô†. Which of the following hands can profitably call?
K‚ô†9‚ô•
K‚ô•9‚ô†
K‚ô£T‚ô£
A‚ô•5‚ô¶
üé≤ Answer
Strategic vs Actual Frequencies
Despite blockers changing range action frequencies, solvers (including GTO Wizard) do not display the impact of this effect in their strategic frequencies. This leaves a discrepancy between strategic and actual frequencies. This is clearly demonstrated on flush boards:
[6Max Cash, 500NL, 200BB]
HJ opens to 2.5BB and BB defends. BB check-calls a 130% c-bet, the turn checks through and BB check-shoves (for 407%) vs a 61% river bet on a board of Q‚ô†J‚ô†4‚ô•7‚ô¶2‚ô†.
Despite the strategic frequency window declaring that HJ calls 19.8% of the time (1.07 combos out of a total 5.51 combos), they only call 13.8% in reality (0.52 combos out of a total of 3.78 combos).
The 19.8% frequency includes ‚Äúghost‚Äù combos: ones that cannot exist due to our opponent‚Äôs blockers.
BB only shoves hands that contain the A‚ô†, however, HJ‚Äôs 19.8% calling frequency includes many A‚ô† hands. Once removed, the calling frequency becomes 13.8%.
This doesn‚Äôt mean the strategy is incorrect. The expected value calculations account for this effect. It‚Äôs just a matter of interpreting and displaying data. Do we want to examine the strategic frequency or the actual frequency? Some solvers have a switch that allows you to alternate between both views.
Check out this spot in GTO Wizard.
Card Bunching
The final card removal effect we will examine is card bunching. Players tend to fold low cards more often than high cards preflop. So when many players have folded, the remaining players and deck are skewed towards high cards.
At a 3-handed table, BTN acts first, and every combo in their range is equally likely. This is not the case at a 6-handed table when several players have already folded. This card removal affects the ranges and strategy of all players to act, frequencies, and runout probabilities.
UTG RFI range at a 6-handed table
This means that BTN is more likely to hold higher cards when it has folded to them. This can change the BTN‚Äôs actual opening frequency even if they don‚Äôt change their strategic opening frequency.
Let‚Äôs visualize this effect. The following animation displays the density of cards from 2 through Ace in the deck after several players fold. Remember that they‚Äôre more likely to fold low cards, so the remaining cards in the deck (and player‚Äôs ranges who are yet to act) are more top-heavy.
Generally speaking the card removal due to bunching is not very significant, although it depends on the spot. As this is a beginner article, we‚Äôll not cover this effect in great detail. Check out this article by HRC if you‚Äôd like to learn more about the bunching effect.
Conclusion
There are 1326 possible combinations of starting hands in Texas Hold‚ÄôEm made up of 78 pocket pairs, 312 suited hands and 936 unpaired, offsuit hands. Some of these combos can be blocked by the board or players‚Äô hands and ranges, further decreasing the number of available combos. This should be accounted for and optimized for when forming a strategy.
There are 3 key card removal effects: dead cards, blockers and card bunching; each with their own unique properties.

### TOPIC: pot geometry
Pot Geometry
What is Pot Geometry?
‚ÄúPot Geometry‚Äù refers to betting an equal fraction of the pot on each street, such that you‚Äôre all in by the river. This betting strategy is also called the ‚Äúgeometric bet size‚Äù or ‚Äúgeometric growth of the pot‚Äù (GGOP).
Betting geometrically has one major effect: This strategy maximizes how much money your opponent puts into the pot. If you want to get all the money in by the river, then betting geometrically will force the widest theoretical defence from your opponent.
In this article we‚Äôll explore the theory of pot geometry, why it causes the opponent to defend wider, go through examples, and discuss the limitations of this betting strategy.
Maximize how wide villain defends
Why does betting geometrically maximize how wide villain calls?
Let‚Äôs imagine you have two goals:
Get all the money in by the river.
Make your opponent call as many hands as possible.
There are an infinite number of betting strategies that can accomplish this. You can bet huge then small then medium. Or overbet twice. Or check->check->shove. But what betting strategy is most effective at making villain call widest? The Geometric bet size, of course!
Betting the same fraction of the pot on each street will theoretically maximize how wide villain calls overall and how much money gets contributed to the pot on average.
But why? ü§î
We can estimate how wide villain defends using Minimum Defence Frequency (MDF). Multiply the MDF on each street to find the final calling range.
Example
The pot is $100
The stack is $1300
Action starts on the flop
Examine two betting strategies:
Strategy A) Shove $1300
Strategy B) Bet the pot on each street
Strategy A)
Villain calls: 1/(1+13) = 7% of their range.
Villain contributes: 7% of their $1300 stack, for a total of $91.
Strategy B)
Villain calls: 50% * 50% * 50% = 12.5% of their range.
Villain contributes: 12.5% of their $1300 stack, for a total of $162.5.
Strategy B has villain donating almost twice as much money to the pot, which doesn‚Äôt even include the money they call on earlier streets and that fold before showdown. If you account for that, then villain‚Äôs total contribution is closer to $237.
How many streets?
Pot is $6
Stack is $97
The geometric bet size is a function of how many streets (bets) remain. Fewer streets require larger sizes to get money in by the river:
The general formula for finding the geometric bet size is as follows:
Calculating this in-game is overkill, though. It‚Äôs best to simply estimate the geometric size by thinking about the size of the stack and pot by the river.
Betting smoothness
Let‚Äôs define the ‚Äúsmoothness‚Äù of your betting strategy as the standard deviation of all your bet sizes (in pot%) on every street.
Here we‚Äôve created a spreadsheet with 400 different betting patterns, all of which get money in by the river. Next, we‚Äôll graph the smoothness of a bet against the total amount contributed. We can see from the graph below that the smoother the betting strategy, the more money goes into the pot.
The verticle axis represents how much money villain puts into the pot. The horizontal axis represents the standard deviation (spread) between our flop/turn/river bet sizes.
Villain‚Äôs calling range widens proportionally with the smoothness of our bets. The further our betting pattern deviates from geometric the less they are required to call us down to deny us a profitable bluff.
This is why you stack off tighter when playing deeper. Nut advantages are more valuable as stack-off ranges tighten.
Next, we‚Äôve graphed different betting strategies against how much money villain puts into the pot. Note that villain contributes the most money to the pot when our flop/turn/river bet sizes are the same (as a percentage of the pot).
Explore this data
We‚Äôve linked the spreadsheet here so you can play around with the data. You can try different stack and pot sizes.
When to bet geometrically
Game theory optimal strategies typically use geometric bet sizes when they want to maximize value with a big nut advantage. This works best when your range is polarized and your opponent‚Äôs range is capped.
The geometric betting strategy is derived from MDF, which only really holds true in a polarized vs bluff-catcher toy game. However, you should still bet geometrically when you have a big nut advantage.
One of the most common examples are turn probe bets.
Example 1: BB Probe vs IP SRP
Here we see a BB vs BTN probe strategy on AK22r after the flop checks through. The pot is 5.5BB, the stack is 97.5BB, and there are two streets left. The geometric size here is 252% pot. As you can see, the GTO strategy here is to bet geometrically or not at all.
BB has a nut advantage in trips, so they press that advantage as hard as possible to get stacks in by the river.
Example 2: IP C-Bet vs BB
We see a similar strategy on the flop in position. Here BTN has a major top pair advantage and presses it using the geometric bet size over three streets:
Non-Geometric Strategies
Let‚Äôs examine our goals and assumptions.
Goals
Get all the money in by the river.
Make your opponent call as many hands as possible.
Assumptions
Our opponent will defend according to MDF.
Our nutted hands will remain the nuts by the river (this is a hidden assumption).
These goals and assumptions are not necessarily true. The geometric betting strategy is designed for perfectly polarized situations, but that‚Äôs rarely the case in practice.
A perfectly polarized range only consists of the invulnerable nuts and pure bluffs (relative to villain‚Äôs range). Equity is static (nothing can improve or get worse). But actual poker is full of draws and equity is not static. Most hands can improve or get worse by the river.
More importantly, you rarely have enough nutted hands to implement this strategy. Most medium hands cannot play for stacks without overplaying their value.
GTO strategies are non-geometric in the majority of spots. GTO rarely uses a geometric strategy before the turn, as ranges are too close and equity too dynamic. Equities crystalize on later streets and ranges become more polar, incentivizing geometric bet sizes. When equities run much closer and can shift more easily on early streets, this is not the case.
Conclusion
Betting geometrically is designed to get all the money in by the river while maximizing how wide villain needs to defend.
This betting pattern is derived from MDF and ideal for polarized vs bluff-catcher scenarios. However, it‚Äôs not always ideal in the real world, as ranges are rarely perfectly polarized.
The geometric bet size is most useful when you‚Äôre pressing a clear nut advantage on static textures (your nutted hands likely remain nutted by the river). This strategy becomes more common in GTO on later streets when ranges have been clarified.

### TOPIC: pot odds
What are Pot Odds in poker?
Pot odds tell you what portion of the pot you need to win to justify a call. This metric is easy to calculate and is a tool every player should have in their tool belt.
In this article, we‚Äôll review the fundamentals of Pot Odds, how to calculate them, and the limitations of this metric.
Why should you learn this?
Pot odds are a fundamental calculation in poker. In the simplest terms, pot odds tell you that if you want to call, for example, a $5 bet, you better recoup at least $5 from the pot (in the long run).
It doesn‚Äôt make sense to put money into the pot if you don‚Äôt recoup it later. We‚Äôre referring to the long-term expected value of a call rather than the immediate result. Sometimes you‚Äôll recoup the call and then some; other times, you‚Äôll lose entirely. But on average, you need to recoup your investment. That‚Äôs why pot odds are a fundamental staple of poker theory.
Pot odds are essentially a Risk/Reward calculation. By examining the size of the bet relative to the pot, you can calculate exactly how often you need to win to justify calling. We weigh the risk against the reward to find the breakeven point.
Calculating Pot Odds
Pot odds tell you what percentage of the pot you need to win in order to justify calling a bet. To calculate pot odds, all you need to know is the size of your opponent‚Äôs bet relative to the pot.
For example, let‚Äôs say our opponent bets $10 into a $20 pot. We need to recoup at least $10 out of that new pot after calling. So what percentage of that new pot do we need to win?
For simplicity, let‚Äôs imagine there‚Äôs no more betting on future streets, and this bet is a shove. In that case, the portion of the pot we‚Äôll win is simply our equity.
Click here to learn more about equity!
Calculating required equity as a percentage
Required Equity to call = (Call amount) / (Pot size after we call)
Required Equity to call = $10 / ($20 + $10 + $10) = 25%
If we win 25% of the time after calling, we‚Äôll recoup our $10 investment. So we need to win at least a quarter of the new pot, on average, to get our money back. Obviously, we‚Äôd want to win more often than that, but we cannot justify calling if we win less than 25% of the time.
Calculating as Odds
Some players prefer to calculate this using odds rather than percentages:
We are risking $10 to win the pot and our opponent‚Äôs bet ($30). Therefore, we are getting 3:1 on a call. That means we need to win at least 1/(3+1) = 25% to break even on a call.
Cheat Sheet
Players who are less mathematically inclined may simply want to use a cheat sheet. We‚Äôve created just such a sheet! Simply look at the first column, select your opponent‚Äôs bet size, and then look at the second column to determine how often you need to win.

Preflop shove example
CO vs SB shove
100BB Cash Game. 50NL Rake structure.
CO (Hero) opens to 2.3BB, SB 3bets to 11.5BB, CO 4bets to 25BB, SB shoves for 100BB total.
Check this spot out in GTO Wizard.
Action on CO with this range:
CO range facing SB 5bet shove
What hands should call? Well, in order to find the correct calls, all we need to do is calculate our pot odds and call with any hand that has at least that much equity.
Amount to call: 75BB more
Total pot after we call: 201BB ‚Äì rake (4BB) = 197BB
Required equity to call: 75/197 = 38% minimum
Next, we need to look at the SB‚Äôs shoving range to calculate our equity against it.
SB 5bet shoving range vs CO 4bet
I‚Äôll copy SB‚Äôs range (Using the Ranges Tab) in GTO Wizard and paste it into an equity calculation tool like Flopzilla.
Here we can see our equity against this shove:
CO Equity facing SB shove
Now, remember, we need at least 38% equity to call. So we should call any hand with at least that much equity. In other words, we call (TT+, AK).
Let‚Äôs check our assumptions against the GTO Solution. Hands in green are calls, and blue are folds.
CO strategy facing SB shove
As you can see, it only calls hands that have the correct equity to do so, according to our pot odds.
But my opponents are nits!
That‚Äôs fine! The beauty of understanding Pot Odds is that you can adjust to their strategy. For example, let‚Äôs imagine SB only shoves QQ+, AKs.
Nit SB shove
What is our equity against that range?
Again, we need 38% to call. Only KK and AA are profitable to call facing this nitty shove. AKs is close to breakeven but just below the line. Hands like QQ are significant losers facing this nitty shove.
Pot odds when future bets are possible
Pot odds are not always so clean when future bets are possible. The percentage of the pot we‚Äôll win is not necessarily equivalent to our equity when future betting rounds exist. However, if you measured equity as your actual expected value divided by the pot, Pot Odds would always hold true. We call this metric your ‚ÄúPot Share‚Äù.
We cover this topic in more depth in our Equity article.
Remember the fundamentals. If your opponent bets $5, you need to recoup at least $5 (in the long run) to justify calling. However, because there are future betting rounds, we may over or under-realize our equity.
A naive pot odds calculation would have BB calling a 2.5BB BTN open with any two cards. For example, 72o has about 30% equity against a standard BTN opening range, so it would have ‚Äúdirect‚Äù pot odds to call. However, this hand will not realize enough equity and therefore not recoup the 1.5BB call investment.
This is where the concept of implied odds, reverse implied odds, and equity realization come into play. A ‚Äúnaive‚Äù pot odds calculation assumes equity = pot share. In reality, equity only equals pot share when no more betting occurs after the call.
Read this article to learn more about implied odds!
Pot odds limitations example
8Max MTT, 40BB effective, 12.5% ante
BTN opens 2.3BB, BB calls.
Flop: KsQh3d
BB checks, BTN bets 2BB into 6BB.
A ‚ÄúNaive‚Äù pot odds calculation would tell us to continue with any hand that has at least:
2 / 10 = 20% equity.
Let‚Äôs use GTO Wizard to look at BB‚Äôs equity facing this bet:
Now let‚Äôs compare that to the optimal GTO strategy:
We see the solver folding hands like A7o with over 40% equity, and calling with hands like 42s which has only 18% equity. So what‚Äôs going on here?
Just because a hand has 40% equity doesn‚Äôt mean it wins 40% of the pot! A7o likely has to fold to any future bets if it doesn‚Äôt turn an Ace. A7o has 0EV facing this bet. 42dd has much less equity, but it has better implied odds drawing to many backdoor flush/straight draws. 42s also has 0EV.
Lastly, in the Breakdown tab, this Manhattan graph shows the entire BB strategy, sorted by equity. We‚Äôve marked the 20% threshold below:
Pot odds and Expected Value
Pot odds are just a shortcut for calculating the breakeven equity required to call a shove. The shortcut we‚Äôve outlined earlier (call/pot after you call) can be derived from an expected value equation.
Call EV Example
Learning how to calculate the expected value of a call is important because it tells us more than the breakeven point. It tells us exactly how profitable a call is!
To calculate the expected value, we set up an EV equation like so:
EV (Call) = (Win% x Win$) ‚Äì (Lose% x Lose$)
Win% is our equity
Lose% is 1 ‚Äì equity
Win$ is how much we gain (relative to folding) when we call and win
Lose$ is how much we lose (relative to folding) when we call and lose
Note about Win$/Lose$: These are measured relative to folding at the decision point.
Using the CO vs SB shove first example, how much does a call with AKs yield?
Win$ = Amount we win when we call (197BB) subtract our call (75BB) = 122BB
Lose$ = The amount to call = 75BB
Win% = 48.4%
Lose% = 51.6%
EV (Call) = (48% x 122BB) ‚Äì (51% x 75BB) = 21BB
Or about $10.50 playing 50NL.
Deriving the pot odds formula from expected value
EV (Call) = (Win% x Win$) ‚Äì (Lose% x Lose$)
Let‚Äôs replace win/lose% with Q (for equity) and 1-Q. We‚Äôll also replace Win$ with W, and Lose$ with L.
EV (Call) = (Q x W) ‚Äì ((1-Q) x L)
Set EV to 0 to find the breakeven point, and solve for required equity (Q):
EV (Call) = 0 = (Q x W) ‚Äì ((1-Q) x L)
0 = (Q x W) ‚Äì ((1-Q) x L)
QW = (1-Q)L
QW = L ‚Äì LQ
QW + LQ = L
Q(W+L) = L
Q = L / (W+L)
Recall that L is the amount we lose, which is equal to the amount we call.
W is the amount we win, minus our call.
So the final equation gives us:
Required Equity (Q) = Call / (Pot after we call ‚Äì Call + Call)
Required Equity (Q) = Call / (Pot after we call)
Conclusion
Pot odds are a fundamental tool in poker. This essential risk/reward calculation tells us what fraction of the pot we need to win after calling to recoup our investment. Therefore, calculating pot odds is fundamental to your poker strategy. (You can practice these calculations in GTO Wizard Play Mode, which allows you to test yourself during the flow of a game for randomly selected scenarios in a practical, risk-free setting, turning theoretical knowledge into actionable skills.)
Let‚Äôs recap:
Pot odds are a risk/reward calculation that tells you what portion of the pot you need to win to recoup your investment.
If you call $5, you need to recoup $5 in the long run
Using raw equity doesn‚Äôt always work if future betting is allowed
Pot odds can be derived from an expected value equation
### TOPIC: preflop raise sizing
Preflop Raise Sizing: Examining 2 Key Factors
It amazes me that, after nearly twenty years of playing no-limit hold ‚Äòem professionally, I still haven‚Äôt mastered the most fundamental spots. I‚Äôve made millions of preflop decisions about whether to contest the pot, whether to do so by raising, and how much to raise. I had reasonably good approximations but was constantly adjusting them based on experience and solver work.
What I had was more a result of trial and error (and, if we‚Äôre being honest, groupthink) than a deep theoretical understanding of the drivers of preflop decisions. Why might one prefer a smaller or larger raise size? Does position matter? Does rake matter?
I still can‚Äôt claim certainty on the subject, but poker is not about certainty. It‚Äôs about making the best decisions possible with the available information. So, when technology advances and is able to produce better information (e.g., preflop solutions), we have to integrate that in order to keep our decisions as good as they possibly can be.
In this article, we will compare some solver results to better comprehend the effects of rake and position on preflop raise sizing. We will look primarily at solves for 200bb 6-max cash games, but many of the principles will generalize to other game formats: full ring games, tournaments, shallower stacks, etc.
Equilibrium Responses
My starting point for understanding solver strategies is always to look at the opponents‚Äô equilibrium responses to a given action. This provides invaluable insight into what the action accomplishes.
In Position
The following charts show how the in position (IP) opponents respond to LJ‚Äôs raises of various sizes in both raked and unraked games:
One thing that jumps out here is that rake makes an enormous difference. Facing a LJ raise, the HJ, CO, and BTN all VPIP 25%-35% fewer hands in the raked game. It is specifically calling that becomes less appealing because, in this rake structure, no rake is collected from pots that end before the flop. Thus, players actually 3-bet more often in the raked game, drawing those additional 3-bets from hands that would have called in the unraked game.
They call much less often in the raked game, especially against the 2x raise size. The rake eviscerates the pot odds this small raise otherwise offers, making the alternatives of raising and folding relatively more attractive.
Rake makes calling raises considerably less appealing, leading to much lower VPIPs and somewhat higher 3-betting frequencies in ‚Äúno flop, no drop‚Äù games.
Blinds
Calling remains a significant component of the strategy from the Blinds in a raked game. This is especially true when facing a min-raise and/or when in the BB, which are the two cases where the calling odds are most appealing. That said, BB calls a min-raise in the raked game barely 60% as often as in the unraked game, so even in the best calling seat in the house, the difference is dramatic.
BB‚Äôs calling frequency is also most affected by the raise size, which makes sense. All other players are constrained not only by the size of the raise but also by the risk of players behind them calling or squeezing. Only the BB who‚Äôs closing the action makes calling decisions based solely on the pot odds, and so their decisions are more sensitive to changes in those odds.
Players facing a raise are constrained not only by the size of the raise but also by the risk of players behind them calling or squeezing.
Raise Size and Fold Equity
This data puts in perspective the compromises entailed in choosing a raise size. Larger raises increase your risk against IP players in exchange for greater fold equity against the BB and, to a lesser extent, the SB.
Larger raises increase your risk against IP players in exchange for greater fold equity against the Blinds.
Larger raises do buy additional fold equity from IP players as well, but not in an efficient way. A 3bb open risks 50% more than a 2bb open but gets only 5%‚Äì10% more folds from HJ, CO, and BTN. And that‚Äôs in the unraked game! In the raked game, raise size barely affects these IP players‚Äô VPIP frequencies. Only the BB folds 50% more often to a 50% larger raise.
Growing the Pot
But doesn‚Äôt a larger raise also grow the pot for your stronger hands? Yes, but very few hands count as ‚Äústronger‚Äù in this context. In the raked game, AA has an EV of 10.15bb when opened for 3bb versus 9.48bb when opened for 2bb. KK and AKs are the only other hands to have higher EVs with a 3bb open. AKo has the same EV with both sizes, and QQ already shows a significant preference for the smaller size, 1.13bb as opposed to 0.95bb when opened for a 3bb raise.
EV Comparison LJ Open-Raise Sizings @100NL Rake
2bb LJ open-raise
3bb LJ open-raise
These EVs assume 200bb effective stacks and 100NL rake, but the results are not much different at 100bb or in an unraked game. Your best hands have lower EV with shallower stacks, but everything else performs better in early position when there is less money to be wagered. Hands as strong as QQ still perform better with a 2bb open than a 3bb open.
When open-raising, you almost always prefer to take it down immediately or get heads up against one of the Blinds. Getting called or 3-bet by an IP opponent costs you EV with all but your strongest hands.
When opening from early position, small raises hedge your risk against the less good outcomes while giving you the opportunity to achieve the better ones. Smaller raises steal the blinds less often and yield lower EV if you get heads up against the BB (you‚Äôre heavily favored in this scenario, and so would prefer a larger pot), but they also lose less when an in position opponent enters the pot.
Opening the Button
The situation is different when opening from the BTN, but only slightly. Larger raises still do not yield proportionately more folds because the SB remains constrained not only by pot odds but also by the risk of the BB acting after them. Thus, SB‚Äôs VPIP does not change dramatically with open-raise size, especially not in a raked game:
Even when opening from the BTN, most hands perform better as a smaller raise. The situation is not quite as bleak as from the LJ, where only KK+ and AKs preferred the 3bb raise, but it is not a lot better. From the BTN, JJ+, AJs+, AQo+, and KQs all have a higher EV when opening 3bb.
EV Comparison BTN Open-Raise Sizings @100NL Rake
2bb BTN open-raise
3bb BTN open-raise
However, there is another class of hands in BTN‚Äôs opening range that did not exist for LJ. These are very weak hands that perform better as a 3bb open than a 2bb open, hands like J4s, T5s, K7o, and A2o.
BTN‚Äôs weakest hands prefer to trade a greater risk of a 3-bet for more fold equity, but their modest hands do not.
One of the liabilities of a larger raise is that it gets 3-bet more often than a smaller one. That‚Äôs not a problem for BTN‚Äôs weakest opens, which perform badly even when called. It‚Äôs more of a problem for modest hands, which perform well when called but not when raised. BTN‚Äôs weakest hands prefer to trade a greater risk of a 3-bet for more fold equity, but their modest hands do not.
This phenomenon is exclusive to the BTN. Even the CO does not have weak hands that prefer a bigger raise size.
It is also exclusive to the raked game. In the unraked game, BTN opens more hands for 2bb than for 3bb, and only their strongest hands perform better in the 3bb strategy. When no rake is taken, they gain more from playing heads up in position against the BB and so gain less from preflop folds.
Only the ‚Äúno flop, no drop‚Äù rake structure incentivizes larger raises to steal the blinds, and even then, it is only on the BTN.
Important Caveats
To say that AA has an EV of 10.15bb when opened from the LJ for 3bb is to say that that is its equilibrium EV within the 3bb opening strategy. We can recognize that some hands have higher EVs within the 3bb opening strategy and others within the 2bb opening strategy. Still, it does not follow that you maximize your EV by opening 3bb with the hands that prefer that size and 2bb with the rest. Such a strategy would be exploitable and could yield lower EVs if your opponents responded appropriately. The purpose of looking at the EVs of individual hands within each strategy is only to provide insight into the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy in order to better understand the mechanics of preflop raise sizing.
Equilibrium EVs may not reflect real-world conditions. For example, a big part of the reason to open small from early position in a raked game is that your opponents are strongly incentivized to 3-bet if they choose to contest the pot. Small raises enable you to lose the least with your weaker opens while still often getting you the big pots you want with your stronger hands. In games with more casual, inexperienced players, calling is common and 3-bets relatively rare. This could make a larger open raise size, with a stronger range, a good exploit.
Conclusion
The case for small raises in Early Position is compelling. So much is unknown, with plenty of players still to act behind you, that it is hard to determine whether you are interested in investing in the pot unless you have one of a very few premium hands. Small raises offer a cheap opportunity to steal the blinds or get heads up in position while hedging against the risk of 3-bets and cold-calls. This is especially true in games where the rake undercuts the odds a small raise would otherwise offer, incentivizing your opponents to call even less than they otherwise would.
On the BTN, the situation is more complicated. No one can cold call you in position, and 3-betting is risky and expensive for the Blinds. This makes larger opens beneficial not only to your strongest hands but also (in ‚Äúno flop, no drop‚Äù games) to some of the weakest you‚Äôd consider opening.

### TOPIC: preflop range morphology
Preflop Range Morphology
Morphology in poker is the study of shapes/forms of ranges. This domain of poker study is particularly handy when it comes to preflop theory. There are several types of poker ranges, all of which play in strategically different ways. The easiest way to conceptualize them is by associating a particular shape. Instead of trying to track every possible combination of hands, it‚Äôs more efficient to start off by thinking in more general terms, such as the overall shape of a range. This will not only make your preflop decisions easier but also how you perform postflop.
There are four fundamental forms of ranges in poker. One way of representing them is via the following table, which mostly follows the layout of the advanced equity buckets you can view in the postflop solutions.
Polarized ‚Äì Very strong hands and weak hands
Linear ‚Äì Top-down value
Condensed ‚Äì Mostly medium-strength hands
Merged ‚Äì A mix of everything: nuts, air, and middling hands
Linear Ranges
A linear range in poker is
Filled up with hands in a continuous, top-down manner.
It starts with the best possible hands and moves downwards until it reaches a floor.
A (medium to deep-stacked) preflop opening range is the quintessential linear range. For example, this is a 100bb UTG opening range in an NL500 cash game:
An example of a linear range
This range is comprised of 17.6% of all possible starting hands, and crucially, these are the most valuable 17.6% of starting hands (after you account for board coverage). If you, as the first-to-act player, were to play a range of 17.6% of hands, there would be no value in picking 72o. All the less valuable hands in this range open-fold.
This becomes clear when you look at the EV of each hand:
Filtered for the linear open-raising range, displayed in EV view
If you are unfamiliar with this EV view:
Green hands are very valuable
Yellow hands are quite valuable
Orange hands have some value
Red hands are practically worthless
As you can see, the range is mostly green and, in a linear fashion, turns into yellow, then orange, and eventually red.
There are some weak hands in the range, like A3s or 55. These are break-even as opens, but they help achieve board coverage and will often be the bluffs in the range (yet, still expecting to be in good shape some of the time when they get action). These hands are still quite strong in an absolute sense and are certainly not ‚Äòtrash‚Äô hands, of which we will have examples in other ranges.
A linear range will contain all the strongest hands (i.e., uncapped). So, proceed with caution as the player facing them. And conversely, play aggressively as the player wielding them.
Polarized Ranges
A polarized range in poker is
Comprised of very strong hands and bluffs, with little in between.
This is the BB response to an SB open in the same cash game:
An example of a polarized range
In the raising range, there‚Äôs a cluster of very strong hands like AA in the top-left corner and moving down the pocket pair diagonal line in the middle. The next strongest hands are all calls, hands like A9s and 88, which can be classified as medium-strength hands. The bluffs are coming from the weakest region of the range in both the suited and offsuit sections. Trash like T2s and K5o.
We can see which hands are bluffs and value by filtering the raises in the EV view:
Filtered for the polarized re-raising range, displayed in EV view
Most of this range is green (the strongest, most valuable) or red (the weakest, least valuable) hands. This is where you can see whether a hand is a bluff or not. TT is green, so clearly a value hand; it makes 3.65bb as a raise. A2o, however, is a bluff; it makes only 0.03bb on average.
Polarized ranges tend to size up to have their best hands extract as much value as possible and yield the most folds for their bluffs. A typical response to a polarized range is to bluff-catch against them because raising only folds out the bluffs. However, when a range is too polarized, they become vulnerable to attacks with small bets, because such bets lose the minimum when running into the top end of the range, and no bigger bets are required to fold out the bluffs.
Condensed Ranges
A condensed range in poker is
Comprised of middling hands, with little (if any) very strong and very weak hands.
So, it‚Äôs the opposite of a polarized range, which is why it‚Äôs also sometimes called a depolarized range. This is a range made up of medium-strength hands. No nutted hands, but no trash either.
This is the BTN response to the UTG open at our NL500 table.
An example of a condensed range
The calling range here is mostly medium-strength hands. It is missing the nutted portion at the ceiling but also has very little trash from the floor. Again, a quick look at the EVs of the range shows us‚Ä¶
Filtered for the condensed calling range, displayed in EV view
Some green, but plenty of yellow and orange. The included weak hands are there for board coverage reasons. 98s, for example, is a break-even hand but can hit a lot of flops hard, which has the effect of making an opponent a bit more cautious in their aggression on such boards.
The correct OOP response versus a condensed range is to check a lot. This might sound strange because they are missing the nutted hands, but the range is constructed entirely of playable hands with decent equity. The idea behind this type of range construction is to disincentivize future aggression (e.g., the blinds squeezing behind), so it is still a strong range.
If you visit the flop reports tab for this spot, UTG checks 67.5% of the time to the BTN despite having a significant range advantage. The following rule, which has its limits, is often mentioned in this regard: the wider the distance between an open-raiser and a cold-caller, the less checking there should be.
In this example, UTG opens, two players fold, and the BTN calls, with UTG checking 67.5% of the time. If, instead, the CO calls, UTG should check 70.6% of the time. This is because the wider the gap, the bigger the range advantage of the opener, mitigating the power of position. UTG has a much stronger range than the BTN but a more similar range to the CO. This causes position to play a more crucial role, resulting in more checking by the CO.
Merged Ranges
A hard-to-define and often confusing form is the merged range, but here goes.
A merged range in poker is
Not quite polar, not quite linear, but somewhere in between.
It has nutted hands for value, trash hands used as bluffs, and medium-strength hands too.
In cash games, you are encouraged to raise with merged ranges because you are more incentivized to play preflop aggressively because of the rake. However, you don‚Äôt want to have an entirely polarized range when you do it. You want medium-strength hands in the 3-betting ranges for several reasons, such as board coverage and playability.
It‚Äôs best to explore it further by demonstrating with the NL500 example we have been using. This is the BB response to a BTN open:
An example of a merged range
Is the raising range polarized or linear?
It‚Äôs quite hard to say. It has the nutted stuff in the top-left corner, the bluffs with hands like J4s, as well as the middling hands like 99‚Äì77 and the high suited cards like KTs and T9s.
This is the same spot but at NL50:
An example of another merged range
Zooming out, they look very similar. Upon closer inspection, however, you can notice that the NL500 range is a little more linear, and the NL50 range is a little more polar. The NL500 range has more 99/88 and more strong suited hands like ATs/JTs/T9s, etc. The NL50 range has more trash hands, like Q2s and K8o.
The reason for the difference between these ranges is (postflop) rake. At NL50, more rake is paid if the hand goes postflop, so there is more incentive to 3-bet preflop to take the pot down before it goes postflop and rake is charged.
The easiest way to determine why a merged range leans more polar or more linear is to look at the opponent‚Äôs response.
(This method of analysis applies to any preflop spot in any format.)
These are the responses to the 3-bet at NL500 and NL50, respectively:
BTN responses vs BB 3-bets at NL500 (left) and NL50 (right)
When the BTN continues at NL500, they raise 31% of the time. Meanwhile, at NL50, they raise 39% of the time. The deciding factor in whether we have a more linear or polarized range is how likely we are to get blasted off our hand.
At NL50, we raise with a slightly more polarized range because we will get 4-bet more often. It‚Äôs much easier to fold a hand like Q2s than it is to release 99. It sucks to have to fold a strong hand like 99 to a 4-bet, so we are more likely to flat-call preflop with this holding. At NL500, by comparison, we get 4-bet less often, which is why we can be slightly more linear and include more medium-strength hands in our raising range.
Open-Raise Sizing
Once we understand range morphology, understanding preflop open sizing becomes easier. (For a dedicated deep dive on this topic, I can recommend looking into this article.)
In the early days of poker, the conventional wisdom was that early position opens should be larger than late position opens. The logic went that an early position hand would be stronger so it could extract more value. It was also to disincentive too many cold-callers.
In the solver era, the opposite is true.
The early position opens tend to be smaller than the late position opens.
This, for example, is NL500:
Open-raise sizing per position
The smallest open is for the minimum of 2bb from UTG, the CO makes it 2.3bb, the BTN makes it 2.5bb, and the SB makes it 3bb.
This is because an early position opener is more likely to face a 3-bet than a player who opens in late position. This is simply because they will face more opponents than the late position opener.
Most competent players, especially in raked games, will use a 3-bet-or-fold strategy against an open-raise to avoid squeezes. In late position, this is less of a concern, which is why opening bets tend to size up.
Going back to our NL500 vs NL50 comparison.
This is the UTG opening range for NL500:
This is the same range for NL50:
In both cases, we play the same amount (17.6%) of hands, but with some subtle differences in the kinds of hands. At NL500, we play KTo and T8s some of the time and play 55‚Äì22 more often. At NL50, we play A2s some of the time and play K8s‚ÄìK5s more often.
This is because, as we have gotten a taste of earlier, we are going to get reraised more often at NL50 because of the higher rake. That makes it more useful/valuable to have better blocker hands like A2s and K8s that block part of our opponent‚Äôs 3-betting range.
We can size larger when there is less risk of reraises. We open small in early position because it makes it easier for us to fold when we have a weak hand. And when we have a strong hand, we can still reopen the action. When there is more chance of being 3-bet, the shape of our range shifts more towards blocker hands to deter those pesky (for the majority of our range) 3-bets.
This also informs your exploits. If nobody is 3-betting in your games, you should open for a larger sizing. If you are at an aggressive table, you should make your bet sizings smaller and favor hands with blocker value.
Conclusion
When looking at solver outputs, it can be overwhelming to try and remember every hand in a range preflop, even more so postflop. What can make this task of thinking in ranges more manageable is to:
Focus first on the overall shape of the range
Only parse out specific hands for deliberation afterward.
This approach should make the process more efficient and less intimidating/taxing.
Whether it is preflop or postflop, a range can typically be described as one of these four fundamental forms of ranges: linear, polarized, condensed, or merged. The shape of the range will inform the strategy you should deploy.
A linear range is the strongest range, featuring top-down value. You should play aggressively with them and proceed with caution against them.
A polarized range contains nutted hands and bluffs, with very little in the middle. Typically, the optimal strategy is to size up with a polarized range and bluff-catch when you are up against one. When we do attack a polarized range, we prefer small bet sizes.
A condensed range contains mostly middling medium-strength hands. They are played well as bluff-catchers because they tend to beat a lot, if not all the bluffs, but raises only get called by stronger hands. We check to condensed ranges a lot because they don‚Äôt have any trash in them.
A merged range lies somewhere between linear and polarized. They are difficult to define and play against. A merged range will lean more linear when there is less risk of being raised, and lean more polar when our opponent is more likely to take an aggressive action.
### TOPIC: probe betting
Probe Betting
As far as rules of thumb go in poker, ‚Äúcheck to the raiser‚Äù is a pretty good one. The aggressor on the previous street generally has the more polar range and so more incentive to bet, while players who just called the previous street have mostly medium-strength hands and less incentive to grow the pot.
But what happens when the previous aggressor declines to bet? As with most things in poker, ‚Äúit depends‚Äù. This article will look specifically at playing the turn as a BB caller against a LJ raiser who declined to continuation bet the flop in a 100bb cash game, but the general principles discussed here will apply in any situation where a player who had been the aggressor stops betting.
Range Dynamics
What does it mean that the preflop raiser chose not to bet the flop?
The first thing to determine is: What does it mean that the preflop raiser chose not to bet the flop? This depends on the answer to another question: How much did the flop favor the preflop raiser? An in-position raiser has a much stronger preflop range than a BB caller, and they carry this range advantage forward to the flop. In other words, LJ should enjoy a significant range advantage on most flops, though some are better than others. This is why they can continuation bet at a high frequency.
On more favorable flops, a check typically indicates not a weak hand but a medium hand that did not stand to benefit terribly much from betting.
When they do not bet the flop, the composition of their checking range depends heavily on how good the flop was for them. On more favorable flops, a check typically indicates not a weak hand but a medium hand that did not stand to benefit terribly much from betting. In this case, the BB will enjoy a nuts advantage but not an equity advantage on the average turn, which means they will bet at a low frequency for a large size. On less favorable flops, the preflop raiser cannot expect to bet their entire range profitably and thus are forced to check some of their weak hands. In these cases, the BB is more likely to enjoy both an equity and nuts advantage on the turn and so to bet at a higher frequency, though this depends on how much the turn card changes that dynamic.
Favorable Flops
On many flops, the preflop raiser‚Äôs stronger range buys them a profitable bet with any two cards against a BB caller. The only reason for them not to bet, then, is if they expect to make at least as much by checking, through some combination of taking their hand to showdown or bluffing on later streets.
On some very favorable flops, the LJ raiser does not check at all. These boards do little to help the BB and are very dynamic, incentivizing LJ to bet even their medium‚Äìstrength hands for some combination of value and protection. Paired and tripped boards like 333 and QQ5 are good examples.
The example we will investigate is A‚ô¶ K‚ô• 8‚ô•, on which LJ enjoys a massive range advantage but has a small checking range of about 10%. First, here‚Äôs the equity graph showing the extent of LJ‚Äôs advantage.
The LJ has a massive equity advantage, with 65% of the equity, plus has nutty hands like AA, KK, and AK at a far higher frequency than BB. As a result, they could profitably bet any two cards, but they do a bit better by occasionally checking behind. Unlike on the 333 flop, LJ‚Äôs medium-strength hands like A2, K6, and JJ have little to protect against by betting. Betting is not bad per se ‚Äì it often wins the pot ‚Äì but it does not accomplish much that checking would not. Barring a lucky catch, these hands will not be strong enough to keep betting if called, and any hand BB folds would have little chance of winning anyway.
The upshot of all this is that LJ‚Äôs checking range is a bit capped but still quite strong. Not many weak hands check, because the immediately profitable flop bet is a tempting proposition for them. That means BB can‚Äôt start firing turns with abandon, because they will still be at an equity disadvantage. Indeed, there is no turn BB bets at higher than 50% frequency.
Notice also that when they do bet, they often use a large size, indicated by the darker red in the chart. This is the BB leveraging their nuts advantage to bet a polarized range and deny equity to LJ‚Äôs medium-strength hands, which become marginal bluff-catchers at best. BB has only so many nutty hands, however, so can‚Äôt bet too often or else bluff-catching would be solidly profitable for LJ. They mostly check, no matter the turn card, often intending to fold just as they were going to do on the flop.
When BB does bet, they are betting into a strong range and cannot expect to profit from fold equity alone; their bluffs need a chance of winning when called. Their bluffs on a 4‚ô† turn, for instance, are all flush draws and gutshots (the low ones, not the Broadway draws). They pure check and fold their worst hands.
Because they check so many weak hands, they are also incentivized to check some strong ones. Sets, two pairs, and even AJ and AQ are candidates for check-raising.
As with their bets, their check-raise bluffs are all draws. The major change to the bluffing range is the addition of some 4x, which was too strong to bluff with when first to act but loses some of its value once LJ bets. The 4 is a significant blocker, because LJ‚Äôs nuttiest hands are turned sets and two-pairs.
Once the flop comes AK8, BB simply should not put too much money into the pot no matter what happens on later streets.
Such is the extent of the LJ‚Äôs range advantage on this flop that even if LJ declines to bet the flop and turn, BB still has a high checking frequency on most rivers. Once the flop comes AK8, BB simply should not put too much money into the pot no matter what happens on later streets. Favorable action and runouts can improve their prospects at the margins, but their strategy always entails a lot of checking and folding.
Less Favorable Flops
Flops that do not favor the preflop raiser are uncommon, but they are also the flops the raiser checks most often. On 6‚ô• 5‚ô¶ 4‚ô¶, for example, equity is split almost exactly 50-50 between the LJ and BB, with the BB enjoying the nuts advantage. Consequently, the LJ rarely continuation bets, and their checking range contains more weak hands simply because they have more weak hands on flops that do not connect well with their Broadway-heavy range.
How BB plays the turn depends heavily on which card comes, far more so than on the static AK8 flop. When small cards turn, they enjoy a significant range advantage and can bet liberally, including with marginal pairs that benefit from denying equity to the many overcards in LJ‚Äôs range.
When big cards turn, LJ‚Äôs equity improves and BB‚Äôs strategy looks more like it did on the AK8 board, betting a more polar range at a lower frequency:
BB‚Äôs threshold for betting on, say, a 9s turn is much lower than for betting any turn on the AK8 board. They can bet any pair for value and protection, and they can bluff with no-pair, no-draw hands, which still have some equity when called thanks to their pair outs. Their checks are mostly Ace-high, which has some showdown value, rather than very weak hands, which are simply giving up.
Conclusion
The preflop action and the cards on the flop establish strong baselines for how much equity each player is likely to have. The actions each player takes and the cards that come on later streets do not reinvent the wheel; a player with a big equity advantage on the flop does not lose that advantage simply because of one bad turn card or a ‚Äúweak‚Äù action like checking.
A player with a big equity advantage on the flop simply holds many more strong hands than their opponent.
A player with a big equity advantage on the flop simply holds many more strong hands than their opponent. That means they can and should spread those strong hands across their ranges, so that even though they are incentivized to bet their strongest hands, they still have plenty of reasonably strong hands to check.
On flops where the equity is distributed more evenly, correct strategy on later streets depends more heavily on the action and finally community cards.
A check from the preflop raiser is a condensing action, making nutty hands less likely for them. Thus, it is usually correct for their opponent to do some amount of polar betting on the next street with their newfound nuts advantage. Whether they also get to bet more thinly for value and protection, however, depends heavily on how the board texture distributes equity among the players.
### TOPIC: range disadvantage as 3better
Navigating Range Disadvantage as the 3-Bettor
Picture this: We‚Äôre playing a NL500 6-max cash game, and we‚Äôve won a few pots, now sitting 150bb deep. We look down at the beautiful K‚ô£Q‚ô£ in the BB, a suited match of royalty. The CO raises. It folds to us and we comfortably 3-bet to 12bb. Our opponent responds by flat-calling our 3-bet, and we take a flop.
854 rainbow
No backdoor clubs.
No backdoor straight draws.
No big cards to represent, and a flop that helps a lot of the hands our opponent called with preflop.
What now? Don‚Äôt panic. Let‚Äôs consult the Wizard!
Board / Range Interaction
Intuitively, most of us know that flops below Ten-high help the defender, not the aggressor. Since they passed up on the chance to 4-bet us preflop, big card flops will be good for us, and medium flops‚Äîwhich our 3-betting range won‚Äôt contain much of‚Äîwill be bad for us.
Aggregate Flop Reports are an excellent tool for viewing EV on flops classified by various factors, such as suitedness, connectedness or in this case high card. In this example, I‚Äôve sorted the flops based on BB‚Äôs EV from low to high. It‚Äôs clear that King-high flops are the best for our range, whereas Five to Nine-high flops are the worst.
When there aren‚Äôt any broadway
cards, hands like AK‚Äîwhich the 3-bettor would always have more of compared to the caller‚Äîhave missed. In addition, our CO opponent is helped by the flop, improving a lot of their calling hands.
They have 3 sets at a higher frequency, middling pocket pairs 77‚Äì66, and the suited connectors like 87s picked up pair and draw equity; they even flopped a straight with 76s much more often than us.
The ‚ÄòRanges‚Äô view is excellent for providing insight at a glance into which hands appear more frequently in either player‚Äôs range. In this example, OOP has a far higher proportion of KK+ and AK, but IP has a much higher frequency of middling pocket pairs and suited connectors. Suited broadways like AQs and JTs are found equally in both ranges.
Overall, in terms of board/range interaction, 8‚ô•5‚ô¶4‚ô† is a board that interacts very well with our opponent‚Äôs range and not at all well with ours. In fact, our overall equity and EV are lower than those of the CO defender on this board.
The CO also retains a greater percentage of ‚Äònut‚Äô hands ‚Äì in this case: sets, straights and occasionally bottom two pair 54s.
By breaking the ranges down into equity buckets, we get a clearer view of this situation. The CO has the highest percentage of ‚Äònut‚Äô hands with at least 90% equity, which are 88, 55, 44, and 76s. The BB retains the lead for hands with 70-90% equity, mainly QQ‚ÄìAA and 54s. Therefore, BB‚Äôs overpair value region still allows us to play with a polarized
betting strategy.
Yet, we can‚Äôt check-fold everything that missed. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at how we should proceed on the flop by contrasting with another flop.
Betting / Checking Frequency
Usually, as the 3-bettor on a flop like KJ3r, we have a large incentive to be polarized with our overpair nut advantage. That means our value hands want to be betting often, using a geometric size derived from the stack-to-pot ratio (SPR)
that can get us all-in by the river. On a KJ3 board where we have a clear nut and equity advantage over our opponent, we can thus get away with betting our entire range, even out of position.
On the previous 854r flop, however, we lost both our nut advantage and equity advantage as the BB. Therefore, we had to check more often.
This comparison is clear when we compare 854r to a flop like KJ3r, where we do zero checking as the 3-bettor.
Continuation Betting The Flop
OK, let‚Äôs look at what hands we should consider continuation betting. First off, GTO Wizard tells us that we should begin splitting our range between bets and checks on the flop. That means no range betting.
We should be checking roughly 64% of the time, and when we do bet, we prefer a larger size of 75% pot. This makes sense because 150bb deep, we need to start betting a bit bigger on the flop already to set up an all-in by the river with our value hands. A common rookie mistake is to think that as the PFR with a preflop range advantage in overpairs and AK, we can blindly c-bet for half pot with our entire range on any flop ‚Äî the data shows that this is far from the case.
First takeaway: When we do c-bet this board, we do so for a large size and c-bet only 30% of the time.
The second point that we should observe is how we treat our suited hands differently. In this example, we will examine our case study hand, K‚ô£Q‚ô£.
Of all our suited hands, only three-quarters have backdoor flush draws. The one that doesn‚Äôt, which in this situation is clubs, should be handled with much less aggression. In the graphic above, we can see that our betting frequency is dramatically reduced when we compare K‚ô¶Q‚ô¶ to the K‚ô£Q‚ô£. One reason is that KQ of clubs cannot make a nutted backdoor flush, but another reason that‚Äôs often missed is that it‚Äôs also a hand that blocks hands we want our opponent to have.
K‚ô£Q‚ô£ has a trash removal score of 8. If our opponent has Q‚ô£J‚ô£ or K‚ô£T‚ô£, for example, they won‚Äôt continue in the hand when we c-bet. A high trash removal score means we block a lot of trash in our opponent‚Äôs range. This isn‚Äôt good when we are ‚Äòbluffing‚Äô since we want our opponent to have trash that folds.
Second takeaway: Having a backdoor flush draw increases our propensity to barrel with a non-made hand.
The third point might be one regarding offsuit hands.
Should we then only be barreling non-made hands that have backdoor flush draws?
Indeed, we are checking and folding to a bet every time with KQo. However, a hand like Q‚ô†J‚ô† makes an excellent bluff with its backdoor straight and flush possibilities.
Third takeaway: We need to be mindful of choosing bluffing candidates and not blindly barrel ‚Äì offsuit broadways don‚Äôt work well as bluffs in this spot.
Let‚Äôs examine the Equity Distribution Chart on 854r:
Let‚Äôs now look at our value hands. Although there‚Äôs a lot of mixing, it seems like JJ is the threshold where we have enough of an equity gap that we definitely prefer betting. There are quite a few middling hands (e.g., 86s, A8s, and 77) employ a very mixed strategy so we might opt to split betting and checking with these hands at a 50-50 rate.
In terms of betting for value, we could consider a hand like JJ, along with some draw+pair equity hands such as 86s that can improve later.
A hand like QQ particularly wants to bet as it‚Äôs a high equity hand, but many turn cards make the board worse for this hand ‚Äî overcards / straight-completing cards come to mind.
Checking The Flop
Recall that this is a flop where the 3-bettor has lost the nut and equity advantages, but we still retain the ‚Äògood hands‚Äô

edge with our overpairs.
As such, our flop c-betting frequency will be low, but it‚Äôs also necessary to protect our checks with a strong check-calling and check-raising range. Otherwise, our opponent will be able to attack our checks freely.
When the BB checks, the CO will stab about 60% of the time and will only use a small size ‚Äì either the 20% or 33% pot sizing.
Why does the CO only use a small size to stab when facing a check?
The main reason I would offer for this bet size is that this is the best risk-reward ratio to make a hand as strong as AQo or KTs fold, and even the 3-bettor‚Äôs favorite hand, AKo, becomes almost indifferent to folding. A lot of BB‚Äôs hands will have to fold here without CO needing to risk a big bet despite CO having the nut advantage. Yet, it‚Äôs important for CO to bet so that these hands don‚Äôt get to realize equity for free.
Against the 20% pot bet, BB responds by check-raising 22% of the time, calling 52%, and folding 25% of the time.
Against the 33% pot bet, BB responds by check-raising 25% of the time, calling 36%, and folding 38% of the time. The smaller the bet we face, the better pot odds we have to continue. Thus, we can continue with more hands vs a smaller bet.
Filtering by suit presents a very clear strategic big picture. Here, I‚Äôve filtered BB‚Äôs range to include only clubs. Facing a bet, BB folds everything that doesn‚Äôt have a direct link to the board. KTs folds, but we continue with K6s.
For brevity‚Äôs sake, I‚Äôll briefly summarize BB‚Äôs flop strategy after checking and facing a small stab by CO:
We check-raise about 20% of the time.
Our value region contains mainly overpairs (QQ‚ÄìAA) and some strong pair+draws like 87s and 86s. Our bluffs are derived mainly from strong suited broadways with backdoor flush draws like KQs, and gutshots like A7s and K6s. A good rule of thumb to remember is that a good bluffing candidate should have poor showdown value but the ability to make a strong hand on later streets.
We check-call about 40-50% of the time.
Hands that prefer check-calling include 99/TT (not strong enough to check-raise for value), AQs/AJs (just enough showdown value), A4s/65s (enough showdown value with a weak pair).
We check-fold hands that don‚Äôt fit well into either category.
This includes our lovely KQ clubs, most offsuit broadways, and AQo. AKo calls a 20% pot bet but starts folding once CO uses the 33% size. Most of our suited club hands check-fold except AKs.
Summary
Our main takeaways are as follows:
The BB 3-bettor cannot blindly c-bet with their entire range on every flop.
Learn to recognize when you‚Äôre at a range disadvantage and play defensively.
When you do bet these boards, use a big size with bluffs that have the potential to improve.
Protect your checking range with value and strong backdoor draw bluffs.
When facing a small stab, you‚Äôre forced to fold most of your air, can check-call some hands with medium showdown equity, and check-raise aggressively with a polarized range that is similar to your flop c-betting range.
On range disadvantageous flops, the best play for your unmade hands without backdoor potential is usually to simply check-fold the flop.

### TOPIC: range morphology
Range Morphology
A natural step in the thought process from novice to advanced player is the ability to think in ranges. This can often seem like a daunting task, but it becomes much easier when you start thinking of ranges as structures rather than trying to visualize all 1326 combinations of starting hands in your head.
‚ÄúMorphology‚Äù is the study of form or structure. You‚Äôve probably heard terms thrown around such as ‚Äúlinear‚Äù, ‚Äúpolarized‚Äù, ‚Äúmerged‚Äù, ‚Äúcondensed‚Äù, ‚Äúcapped‚Äù, or ‚Äúuncapped‚Äù, but what do these even mean?
Capped / Uncapped
The simplest way to describe a range is in terms of ‚Äúcapped‚Äù and ‚Äúuncapped‚Äù. This gives us an idea of who has the advantage (typically the preflop aggressor), and how we should conduct our play accordingly.
The term ‚Äúcapped‚Äù simply refers to a range that does not have the strongest hands. For example, a BB calling range usually doesn‚Äôt contain premium hands like QQ+ AK, since these hands typically raise preflop. This puts a ‚Äúcap‚Äù on the strength of the range.
Conversely, ‚Äúuncapped‚Äù simply means a range that has the strongest hands. A standard opening range should contain all the strongest hands, so it‚Äôs therefore uncapped.
Something to note is that just because a range started as capped or uncapped doesn‚Äôt mean it will stay that way. Your A‚ô†A‚ô¶ is not that impressive on a 7‚ô£8‚ô£9‚ô£ flop. A capped player can become uncapped on the right board, and vice-versa.
Range morphology: Polarized, Linear, Condensed, Merged
As you progress as a player you will run into more advanced terms to describe ranges such as polarized, linear, condensed/depolarized, or merged.
Linear
Linear: Means top-down value, strongest hands to medium hands. In theory, we see linear ranges anytime you only have one action to continue. For example, opening ranges usually raise or fold, EP 3bet ranges usually raise or fold, and facing a shove you can only call or fold. So when you only have one continuation action, it becomes logical to continue with the best hands and fold the rest. These spots are linear by definition.
Linear ranges can also be found postflop. Typical examples are situations when you‚Äôre facing a large bet and don‚Äôt have much of a raising range. For example, on this AK6r board BTN vs BB SRP, BTN overbets the flop 125% pot. BB‚Äôs defense has very few check-raises, so they simply call in a top-down linear fashion with their strongest hands. Note that most 2nd and 3rd pair are about the same value (indifferent). Although, due to blocker effects, a hand like 6‚ô£3‚ô£ has slightly more value than a hand like KQo.
Polarized
The word ‚Äúpolar‚Äù means to separate into opposing groups. In poker, a polarized range is one constructed of very strong hands and very weak hands, nuts/bluffs.
The most common place you‚Äôll see polarized ranges are in position, on the river. This is the only spot in poker where you don‚Äôt need to worry about protecting your check-back range, so you‚Äôre free to simply bet value hands and bluffs and check back the middle.
For example, on this Blind vs Blind A‚ô†A‚ô•A‚ô¶2‚ô£3‚ô¶ board, BB polarizes their range with quads/boats for value, and their weakest hands as bluffs, checking back the middle of their range.
We can see this reflected in the equity distribution. The betting range consists of the ‚ÄúBest hands (with more than 75% equity), and trash hands (less than 33% equity). This strong/weak distribution is the definition of polarity!
It becomes harder to define ‚Äúbluffs‚Äù and ‚Äúvalue‚Äù on earlier streets. Ranges tend to become more polarized as they approach the river as equity crystalizes. The most common example of a polarized preflop range is a BB 3bet vs a SB open. This is one of the rare times that you‚Äôll have position both preflop and postflop, and the option to close the action.
BB strategy facing SB open
To the untrained eye, it might not be obvious which of these hands are ‚Äúvalue‚Äù or ‚Äúbluffs‚Äù. We can visualize this by viewing the expected value of the 3betting range.
Expected value of BB‚Äôs 3bet range
Why does polarization exist? Why not just bet linear?
This may seem like a simple question, but it‚Äôs quite important to understand. Many novice players (and even strong players who are used to playing against calling stations) have grown accustomed to betting linearly. However, this is not an effective way to organize your equity unless your opponent calls too wide.
The value of betting is always relative to checking.
Imagine we shove linearly, in position, on the river. Without bluffing, we bet all of our strongest hands and some middling hands. This works well if our opponent overcalls, but it‚Äôs easily exploited if they overfold. Our weak check-back range rarely wins, our middling hands fold out worse and get called by better, and our nutted hands get called less. This strategy is exploitable!
This linear strategy is an inefficient way to organize your equity. You need bluffs to get your value hands paid off, and (on the river) the most efficient bluffs are those that can‚Äôt win through checking. This is the cause of polarization.
The problem can be solved by using a polarized range. This incentivizes villain to start calling wider in order to avoid being bluffed off the best hand too often. Moreover, we extract more value with our nutted hands and stop losing value with our middling hands.
Optimal river bets in position are almost always polarized. This is the only spot in poker where you have the option to guarantee a showdown with your middling hands.
Perfect polarization and bet sizing
Polarized ranges are generally associated with larger bet sizes. But why is this? The oversimplified answer is that you want to play for stacks as your value range gets more nutted.
A range is ‚Äúperfectly polarized‚Äù when all the value hands have 100% equity against the opponent‚Äôs range, and all the bluffs have 0% equity against the opponent‚Äôs range, although this rarely occurs in practice.
A perfectly polarized range will always use the ‚Äúgeometric bet size‚Äù. This simply means that they will bet an equal pot% on each street in order to get all the chips in by the river. This betting pattern maximizes the width of the defender‚Äôs range (see MDF), which is a concept we‚Äôll explore more in later articles.
Perfectly polarized ranges are a theoretical concept that rarely applies in practice. It‚Äôs quite uncommon for an opponent to have nothing but static bluff-catchers relative to your range. There are situations where you want to bet larger than the geometric size with an imperfectly polarized range on flop/turn in order to fold out draw equity early on. There are many situations where you want to bet smaller if they have traps or stronger value in range. Poker is complicated, but you need to learn to walk before you can run.
Condensed / depolarized
A condensed (sometimes called depolarized) structure refers to a range that has many medium hands, with few nutted hands and few weak hands.
A common example of this is a GTO SB calling range, which consists of mostly pocket pairs, suited AceX hands, and medium-strong broadways. This kind of range can actually be quite strong on many boards, despite being capped. The lack of air changes the way you should play against this range.
SB strategy vs HJ
SB cold-calling range vs HJ 2BB open
This range is ‚Äúcondensed‚Äù because it doesn‚Äôt have many super strong or very weak hands. The range is condensed towards middling hands. HJ‚Äôs postflop strategy should change to target more made hands and less air, and they‚Äôll need to play more cautiously as a result.
Merged
So far what we‚Äôve seen has been pretty straightforward and clean. Definitions seem simple enough. However, poker is a complex game. Range morphology is more of a spectrum than a well-defined structure.
Merged ranges exist somewhere in-between a polar and linear range. They typically contain some bluffs, some nutted hands, and some medium hands with reasonable implied odds.
Here‚Äôs an example of a merged range on 992r BTN vs BB. BTN c-bets for ‚Öì pot, action on BB. As you can see, BB check-raises quite often, with a very merged range consisting of nutted hands, medium hands, and trash.
BB merged check-raise strategy on 992 vs BTN
We can see this reflected in the equity distribution. The raising range includes many middling ‚Äúweak‚Äù and ‚Äúgood‚Äù hands (33%-75% equity) such as medium pocket pairs. Compare this distribution to the more polarized one we saw earlier.
Why merge?
Merging exists as a natural consequence of the complexity of poker. Perfectly polar ranges are often exploitable and not as effective or robust over multiple streets in the real world.
For example, let‚Äôs imagine that BB simply check-raises trips and the worst trash they can continue with. The problem with this ultra polar strategy, other than the glaring blocker weaknesses on a 2/9/A turn card, is that BB will have to give up a lot more often on turn/river (or start drastically over-bluffing) because they won‚Äôt improve often enough. These bluffs have poor visibility.
Furthermore, extremely polar ranges are often susceptible to very small probing bets or min-clicks. These kinds of attacks are not a problem so long as you have natural calling hands in your range, but they can be hard to defend against if you‚Äôre too polar, as they force you to split your strong value from some of your bluffs.
Lastly, merging gives your opponent worse equity compared to polarized ranges, which means you can barrel more and they can‚Äôt call as wide. It‚Äôs a more efficient construction under the right circumstances, which allows you to raise wider. In short, merging takes the best of both worlds from polarized and linear ranges.
Let‚Äôs take a look at how BTN continues against the check-raise:
BTN vs BB range comparison after check-raise
BTN needs to float with hands that our medium-strength hands beat, such as overcards, Ace-X, and double-backdoor type hands. We can outdraw their value, continue bluffing on later streets and fold out a significant chunk of their equity that can outdraw our non-nutted hands.
Visualizing the linear-polar spectrum with preflop ranges
A merged range can be thought of as something between a linear and polarized strategy. We can see this change by observing patterns in BB vs BTN 3betting ranges.
Typically, smaller 3bet sizes and lower rake result in a strategy that‚Äôs closer to linear, whereas larger 3bet sizes and higher rake structures tilt more polarized. This has to do with the proportion of BTN‚Äôs calls:4bets facing our 3bet.
If BTN calls more and raises less often, we want to use a more linear range that can outdraw their calls. This is exactly what happens when there‚Äôs less rake or we use a smaller 3bet size.
Conversely, if they often raise and don‚Äôt call much, we‚Äôre better off using a polar range of value that‚Äôs happy to face a raise, and snap-fold bluffs, rather than getting blasted off our medium hands with high call EV.
Since everyone has different subjective ideas of what constitutes a ‚Äúvalue‚Äù or ‚Äúbluff‚Äù raise, we‚Äôll simply look at the expected value of the 3betting range.
Merged-Linear 3betting range: (11BB raise @ 500NL rake)
Merged 3betting range: (11BB raise @ 50NL rake)
Merged-polar 3betting range (13BB raise @ 50z rake)
All three of these ranges are ‚Äúmerged‚Äù however they can lean linear or polar as we change the variables.
Recap
Let‚Äôs summarize:
Capped ‚Äì Does not have the best hands in range (e.g. a BB preflop calling range does not have AA).
Uncapped ‚Äì Has the best hands in range (e.g. a BTN opening range has AA).
Linear ‚Äì Top-down value to medium hands (Used when deciding between a fold and a continue without a third action, or as an exploit against calling stations, uncapped).
Polarized ‚Äì Strong and weak hands (Used when representing the nuts or nothing, often with very large sizes).
Condensed ‚Äì A range consisting of medium hands without many weak or nutted hands, (e.g. a BTN flatting range vs EP open).
Merged ‚Äì Strong, weak, and some medium hands (more robust, less exploitable, often used with smaller bets/raises).
Linearity and polarity exist on a spectrum.
This kind of terminology is crucial to range analysis when studying poker. Thinking of ranges as structures can help identify the strengths, weaknesses, and incentives of different plays. Hopefully, you are now ready to take your analysis to the next level!
### TOPIC: responding to large preflop raises
How To Respond to Large Preflop Raises in Poker
Solver-derived preflop charts for both cash games and tournaments have historically assumed small raises on the part of the original raiser, usually two to three times the big blind. There are good reasons to use such small raise sizes at a table full of savvy, studied players.
In tournaments, small preflop raises are indeed the norm, both live and online. In live cash games, however, it is quite common to see open-raises of four or more times the big blind. This makes the aforementioned charts difficult to use, as they do not approximate the situations you are likely to encounter at a small stakes cash table. As we will see, the way you respond to a 2x raise should be quite different from the way you respond to a 4x raise!
In this article, we will examine some of those differences. We will still not arrive at definitive answers, as players employing these suboptimal raise sizes will probably have suboptimal raising ranges, responses to 3-bets, and postflop play as well, none of which will be taken into account by the solver. However, we will arrive at some heuristics for how to adjust your strategy to raises of different sizes.
Raked Games
Whether or not pots are raked is enormously consequential for your strategy. We will first examine a game with:
10% rake capped at 2bb
A ‚Äúno flop, no drop‚Äù structure where you pay no rake on pots that end preflop.
The following charts show CO‚Äôs equilibrium Raise First In (RFI) frequency for a variety of raise sizes when the action folds to them in such a game, along with how the BTN, SB, and BB respond to these raises.
To be clear, these simulations assume the CO is permitted only the raise size in question, and the responses assume no one else has yet contested the raise. In other words, the stats for SB assume BTN folds, and the stats for BB assume both BTN and SB fold.
Larger raises put more money at risk and so require stronger hands to be profitable.
125bb starting stacks
Here is CO‚Äôs RFI frequency and the responses with 125bb stacks:
A Flourish chart
CO ought to raise fewer hands when they use larger raise sizes. Fundamentally, larger raises put more money at risk and so require stronger hands in order to be able to do so profitably.
These large raises are not advised. Even AA wins less by raising 7x than it does by raising 2x, a whopping 2bb less. The most profitable size for AA is 3x, which averages 11.02bb compared to 10.34bb with a 2x raise. A 3x raise size still enables CO to open most of the hands they would open for a 2x raise while getting called only ‚Öì as often by the BB, which is a big win when it comes to saving money on rake.
You should fold more often to larger raises even if you think your opponent is not adjusting their opening range.
Unsurprisingly, the remaining players fold more often to larger raises. BTN and SB consistently 3-bet less often against larger raises, but for the BB, the relationship is more complex. While the other seats virtually never call a raise of any size, BB has a robust calling range against smaller raises. As the price of calling goes up, however, BB stops calling as well. They fold many hands that would have called a smaller raise but sometimes 3-bet them as well!
You should fold more often to larger raises even if you think your opponent is not adjusting their opening range. In other words, even if you assume your real-life opponent has a 4x raising range that resembles a solver‚Äôs 2x raising range, you should still fold more often than you would against the solver‚Äôs 2x raise (though perhaps not as often as you would against a solver‚Äôs 4x raise). This is because the larger raise offers you less good odds, forcing you to risk more money to contest the pot.
The solver virtually never calls from any seat but the BB, even against a small raise. If you are going to contest the pot, you are incentivized to 3-bet for a combination of two reasons:
To push out other players behind you.
To increase the chances that the hand will end preflop, saving you the rake.
But even from the BB, calling loses its appeal as the raise size increases. The rake eviscerates the pot odds you‚Äôd otherwise be getting, such that any hand strong enough to overcome the edge lost to rake is strong enough to raise.
The rake is really punishing. To make this concrete, the solver sometimes folds hands as strong as 88 on the BTN to a 2x CO raise. The hands they play consistently are mostly big cards that block the hands with which other players would contest your 3-bet, making it more likely you will win it preflop without paying rake. This resembles MTT strategy with high risk premiums, where responses to raises are similarly tight and aggressive, with a premium on blocker-heavy hands that increase your fold equity.
BTN response vs CO 2x open-raise: 10% rake, 125bb starting
Facing a 4x raise, BTN goes even more blocker-heavy, folding virtually all hands containing a card below a Ten and even AJo!
BTN response vs CO 4x open-raise: 10% rake, 125bb starting
Their response to a 7x raise is preposterously tight, with even TT and AJs folding!
BTN response vs CO 7x open-raise: 10% rake, 125bb starting
It is interesting to note that BTN, SB, and BB respond almost identically to CO‚Äôs 7x raise. In a 3-bet pot, the SPR will be low enough that position will not matter much. Nor does having 1bb already in the pot affect your odds all that much when you‚Äôre facing a towering 7bb raise. And ranges are so tight that SB and BB will rarely wake up with a 4-betting hand, meaning that the BTN does not take on substantially more risk by 3-betting with two players still to act.
Deeper Stacks (Raked)
Deeper stacks incentivize CO to open a slightly wider range. While the BTN can still be a thorn in their side, their position will be a greater asset should they end up playing postflop against one of the Blinds. The deeper stacks also make it slightly less appealing for the Blinds to 3-bet (though they make it slightly more appealing for the BTN).
Larger raise sizes are more defensible with deeper stacks. They are still not the GTO, solver-preferred option, but, at least from late position, they may be good exploits in games with loose, passive opponents (i.e., most live cash games).
300bb starting stacks
When 300bb deep, AA has the highest equilibrium EV using the 4x raise size. The trade-off is that weaker hands have lower EV, such that many can‚Äôt be profitably opened at all. Against looser opponents who will call those big raises with bad hands, you‚Äôll still need to tighten your preflop opening range, but more of your best hands will profit from a larger size.
A Flourish chart
The responses from the other players are not terribly different from what they would be with shallower stacks. BTN raises a bit more often, as they are happy to grow a pot IP against CO‚Äôs wider range. The Blinds, however, 3-bet less often. Even though CO‚Äôs range is wider, playing 300bb deep from OOP is a tough hurdle to overcome.
Unraked Pots
When pots are not raked, calling is a more appealing option from all positions, and 3-bet ranges are more polar. These strategies will be appropriate not only in friendly games where no fees are charged but in games with a time rake or membership fee‚Äîany game where the rake is not taken from the pot.
125bb Starting Stacks
Here are the equilibrium strategies with 125bb stacks:
A Flourish chart
CO‚Äôs opening frequencies are not much different from the raked game; in some cases, they are even a bit lower! It seems the rake can actually be a small help to the original raiser, deterring other players from calling and making it more likely the raise will take the blinds down uncontested.
As we noted above in the raked game, the size of the original raise does not affect 3-betting frequency terribly much, especially not for the Blinds. What changes is their incentive to call. The BTN always does some calling in the unraked game, as their position reduces the incentive to end the hand preflop.
For the Blinds, however, calling is mostly about the discount due to the money they already have in the pot. The bigger CO raises, the less it matters that they have a blind (or half a blind) already posted.
Facing a 2x raise, even SB has a substantial calling range, accompanied by a more polar 3-betting range:
SB response vs CO 2x open-raise: unraked, 125bb starting
BB follows the same pattern but with many more hands incentivized to call when getting 3.5:1. Facing a 5x raise, those BB calls vanish almost entirely, replaced by a linear 3-betting range:
BB response vs CO 2x open-raise
BB response vs CO 5x open-raise
Deeper Stacks (Unraked)
300bb Starting Stacks
When 300bb deep, BTN‚Äôs position (and CO‚Äôs wider opening range) incentivizes them to both call and raise slightly more often. The Blinds, however, 3-bet less, leading them to call slightly more often:
A Flourish chart
With shallower stacks, the Blinds could count on a low SPR and good equity realization should their 3-bet get called. With deeper stacks, however, 3-bets yield fewer folds from an IP opponent and worse equity realization postflop. The deeper stacks also make 4-betting a greater threat. SB raises more than BB because their raises also serve as a deterrent to BB entering the pot, but neither raises often.
Facing a 5x open, not even JJ, AKo, or AQs are pure 3-bets for BB:
BB response vs CO 5x open-raise: unraked, 300bb starting
If your opponent can correctly deduce the flops on which you will reliably have strong hands and the ones on which you will not, they can exploit you badly.
Facing a 2x open, AA is BB‚Äôs only pure 3-bet:
BB response vs CO 2x open-raise: unraked, 300bb starting
All the mixing is important here, because when you are deep and OOP, predictable is a very bad attribute to have. If your opponent can correctly deduce the flops on which you will reliably have strong hands and the ones on which you will not, they can exploit you badly.
Mixing is also an important part of BTN‚Äôs 3-betting, but they have more pure 3-bets. On the left, we can see their response to a 2x CO open. Even against a 7x open (on the right), they continue to call with pocket pairs and suited broadways. These hands complement each other well, making it difficult for CO to predict whether high or low cards will help them.
BTN response vs CO 2x open-raise
BTN response vs CO 7x open-raise
Conclusion
Larger open-raise sizes present opponents with a different risk profile than smaller, solver-preferred raises. This is for two reasons:
A larger raise ought to have a stronger range behind it.
A larger raise makes both calling and 3-betting more expensive.
Even in the absence of (1), you still should respond more tightly to larger raises simply because they offer less good odds (2).
The size of the open-raise primarily determines your calling frequency, with a much smaller impact on how often you 3-bet. In unraked games, that‚Äôs a big impact, as calling is a significant part of your response to smaller raises but mostly drops out against larger ones.
When the pot is raked, calling even small raises is undesirable unless you are in the BB. That means your strategy will not vary as much with the size of your opponent‚Äôs raise, though you‚Äôll have a somewhat higher threshold for 3-betting larger raises, and should use a slightly smaller multiple of their raise when you do so.
### TOPIC: slow playing
Slow-Playing
Slow-playing, like running a big bluff or making a heroic call, feels great when it works. It feels like you are winning by wits alone, playing your opponent like a fiddle as you cajole them into throwing ever more money into a pot they have no chance of winning.
The danger of this good feeling is that it may seduce you into slow-playing when it is not wise to do so, costing you many chips, if not the entire pot. Ultimately, you want to play big pots with your big hands, so it‚Äôs best to find ways to create deception while still putting chips into the pot.
In this article, we will consider the incentives around slow-playing:
What are the risks?
What are the rewards?
And when is it just fancy play syndrome?
What Is Slow-playing?
You probably have some idea already, but for the sake of clarity, when I talk about slow-playing, I am talking about:
Deliberately taking a passive line‚Äîchecking and calling‚Äîwith a hand strong enough to bet or raise for value.
The purpose of slow-playing is to deceive your opponent into thinking your hand is weaker than it actually is. To keep things simple, I will generally talk about slow-playing the flop, but similar considerations will apply to slow-playing before the flop or on the turn (or on other streets, in other games‚Äîthe material in this article is not terribly specific to Hold ‚Äòem).
Incentives and Deception
Deception is not an end in itself.
Your ultimate goal when you hold a strong hand is for the pot to grow. Deception is valuable only insofar as it causes your opponent to put more money into the pot than they would have had you played your hand more aggressively.
For an extreme example, suppose you checked the nuts last to act on the river. That would certainly be deceptive, but it would not accomplish your goal of playing for big pots with big hands. This example may sound ridiculous, but in fact, people make ridiculous, counterproductive slow-playing decisions all the time because they fixate on deceiving their opponent rather than on growing the pot.
Deception in poker is not necessarily about playing a hand contrary to its incentives. Often, you can be just as deceptive by playing your hand in a way that is perfectly aligned with its incentives but which could also credibly represent a different sort of hand with different incentives.
An Example
Suppose you open the BTN in a 100bb cash game and the BB calls. You bet 125% pot on a K‚ô†9‚ô•5‚ô¶ flop and 125% pot again on a 2‚ô£ turn.
Is this a deceptive way to play a set of fives? Why or why not?
From one perspective, it sure looks like you have a strong holding. You‚Äôre shoveling money into the pot, with the threat of an all-in bet looming on the river. That‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôd like to do with a very strong hand, and your opponent has good reason to fold for fear that you may have one.
But they also have good reason not to fold because, from another perspective, this is also exactly what you‚Äôd like to do with some of your weakest holdings. Precisely because this is how you‚Äôd like to play a strong hand, it‚Äôs a good, deceptive way to play a weak hand. And vice versa. Playing strong and weak hands in this way gives both the opportunity to accomplish their objectives and puts your opponent in a genuinely tough spot.
In other words, it creates deception without compromising the incentives of each hand in the range:
To grow the pot, in the case of a strong hand
And to steal the pot, in the case of a weak hand
As it happens, the solver takes this line with both strong hands (such as sets) and weak hands (such as gutshots).
What Does Slow-playing Represent?
In my experience as a coach, people tend to be very aware of ‚Äútelling a story‚Äù when they are bluffing. That is, they think about what they are representing and why it is plausible they could have that strong hand instead of the weak one they currently hold. But storytelling is just as important when you have a strong hand! In either case, the aim is to deceive your opponent by credibly representing a hand other than the one you currently have.
When you check the flop, you may be telling the story that you are weak. But as soon as you put chips into the pot after checking, the jig is up. It no longer looks like you have a weak hand because weak hands usually fold after checking.
Checking and calling looks like either a medium-strength hand or a trap. That‚Äôs not necessarily a problem, as representing a middling hand could entice your opponent to run a big bluff, but you should be aware of what you‚Äôre representing so your play (storyline) remains coherent on later streets. If, after checking and calling, you come out with a massive bet on the river, that‚Äôs not consistent with a medium-strength hand, nor is it the best way to win money from your opponent‚Äôs bluffs, which is what you were presumably trying to induce by checking and calling in the first place.
Risk 1: Giving Free Cards
The obvious risk of slow-playing, the one people are most aware of, is the risk of a free card costing you the pot. The less obvious risk is failing to grow the pot, which, as we will see, can cost you quite a lot of potential winnings even when it doesn‚Äôt cost you the pot itself.
Most humans tend toward loss aversion, an excessive concern for holding on to what they already have, even if it means missing opportunities to gain more than they would put at risk. It is understandable, then, that the average poker player would worry more about the risk of losing a pot they are currently winning than the risk of missing out on future winnings. Winning a big pot feels good, and your brain may deliver roughly the same dopamine hit for whether you win $500 or $700, whereas it may punish you excessively if your choice to slow-play costs you a pot your brain was already counting as its own.
This is not to say that the risk of giving free cards is negligible, only that it tends to get too much attention in discussions around slow-playing. In particular, people tend to fixate on the wrong ways in which a free card could hurt them.
A free card costs you the pot only if the hand that improved to beat you would have folded to a bet.
Big, obvious, strong draws like flush draws and open-ended straight draws don‚Äôt generally fold to bets, so while slow-playing may cost you the opportunity to put money in as a small favorite against those draws, it doesn‚Äôt cost you as big of a pot when they draw out.
The scenarios where a free card really costs you dearly are when a hand that would have folded hits an unexpected miracle. If you check 55 on that K‚ô†9‚ô•5‚ô¶ and your opponent holding 66 turns a bigger set, you aren‚Äôt costing yourself just the current pot but additional bets on the turn and river as well. It‚Äôs not a likely scenario, but it‚Äôs expensive when it happens.
Risk 2: Failing To Grow the Pot
The other risk of slow-playing is failing to grow the pot, which can result in winning much less when your opponent has a hand that would have put more money into the pot. Suppose you flop a royal flush against a very special opponent. This opponent will sometimes fold to flop bets, but they never fold to pot-sized bets on the turn and river. With $100 in the pot, you have a choice between two betting lines:
You can bet 30% pot on the flop, 100% pot on the turn, and 100% pot on the river. Or,
You can check the flop, bet 100% pot on the turn, and 100% pot on the river.
How often does your opponent need to fold the flop in option 1 to make it worse than option 2?
It‚Äôs easy to calculate what option (2) is worth. Your opponent never folds, so you win a $100 bet on the turn, a $300 bet on the river, and the starting pot of $100, for a total of $500.
When your opponent calls your $30 flop bet in option (1), you then bet $160 on the turn and $480 on the river, plus the starting pot, for a total of $770. Missing out on one small bet might seem like a small price to pay to get two big bets guaranteed on the turn and river, but because that small bet sets you up to make even larger bets on the later streets, you lost out on not just the $30 bet but a total of $270 over the course of the hand. Your opponent would need to fold the flop more than 40%

of the time to the 30% pot flop bet to make option 1 less desirable!
But There Are Also Rewards
Real poker is much more complicated, of course, but this simple example demonstrates one common effect of slow-playing:
Checking the flop with a strong hand often makes it more likely you will get two bets, but less likely you will get three.
There are three primary means by which checking might induce your opponent to put in bets on later streets with hands that would not have paid you off otherwise :
They had a weak hand on the flop and would‚Äôve folded, but the turn improves them to a second-best hand with which they are willing to pay off bets.
Checking induces them to bluff with a weak hand that would have folded to a flop bet.
Because you are generally incentivized to bet your strongest hands, they correctly lower their standards for putting money into the pot on future streets after seeing you check the flop.
Timing Your Slow Plays
In light of the above risks and rewards, we can reach some conclusions about when slow-playing may be desirable. Recall the two major risks of slow-playing: getting outdrawn and failing to grow the pot. When neither of these represents a grave concern, slow-playing becomes more desirable.
On that K95r flop we‚Äôve been talking about, very few hands show a strong preference for betting over checking. The few that do include 55 and 99, but not KK. Why do you think that is?
EV comparison: check vs bet 33% pot
The hands most likely to call you down on three streets have a King in them. So, the cost‚Äîin the form of missed out on benefits‚Äîof slow-playing KK is less than the cost of slow-playing lower sets because, when you so heavily block the BB‚Äôs King-x hands, you are unlikely to get three bets paid off anyway. This is also why a set of Nines has higher EV than a set of Kings.
Another argument for slow-playing is when your hand simply is not strong enough to value-bet three times. In that case, checking doesn‚Äôt cost you a bet because you weren‚Äôt going to bet three times anyway.
Checking as a slow play doesn‚Äôt cost you a bet when that extra bet couldn‚Äôt be profitably made.
BTN often slow-plays their weaker Kings on this flop because they are tough to draw out on‚Äîonly one larger card could fall‚Äîand won‚Äôt bet three times unless they improve:
You may not think of this as slow-playing, but that‚Äôs essentially what it is, and there‚Äôs an important point here:
The best hands for slow-playing are often not your very strongest hands, with which you‚Äôd like to be growing the pot, but rather hands that are tough to draw out on but also not so strong they want to grow an enormous pot.
This is especially true when it comes to inducing bluffs, which is one of the three rewards of slow-playing we identified earlier.
Top pair with a bad kicker beats bluffs just as surely as bottom set does, and it gives up a lot less when it checks to induce.
If you have ever seen young children play soccer, you will understand this concept intuitively. Before they understand the concept of (or have the necessary discipline for) playing position, children just swarm the ball, everyone trying to kick it all at once. There is nobody to pass to and nobody playing defense because they are all in a pack around the ball.
Hands in your range are like players on a soccer team: some fit certain roles/positions better than others, and your team will perform best when everyone sticks to their role/plays their position. Very strong hands excel at betting for value, so that is generally the position they should play. Medium-strength hands are better assigned to the bluff-catching position, especially when they are tough to draw out on.
If you assign all your players to catch bluffs, then you‚Äôve got no one playing offense, a strategy that will perform about as well as those five-year-olds swarming the ball. They‚Äôre cute, but it doesn‚Äôt take Real Madrid to beat them. Even a team of slightly older children, executing slightly better on the game‚Äôs fundamentals (roles), will pick them apart.
Shallow Stacks
There is another case where checking is unlikely to cost you a bet with your strongest hands: when the stacks are so shallow that you don‚Äôt need three bets to get all-in. A 20bb sim for the same K95r flop shows a high frequency of slow-playing KK and 99:
(Even at 40bb, the lower sets sometimes slow-play.)
Note that other strong hands such as AA, AK, KQ, and KJ purely bet. Of course, they don‚Äôt require three streets to get stacks in any more than 99 does, but they are more vulnerable to free cards. With the pot being larger relative to the stacks, the reward for slow-playing is reduced, making the risk of getting drawn out on a greater concern for more vulnerable hands.
Another Way To Slow-Play
Although KK and 99 do not really check in the 100bb equilibrium, they do often bet small. This is true despite the fact that BTN often uses larger bet sizes, including with these hands.
Why does a solver expect betting 33% pot with Kings to make just as much as betting 125%?
This is, in essence, another form of slow-playing.
A hand can be played slower not only by checking instead of betting (or calling instead of raising), but also by betting small instead of betting large.
A small bet, at equilibrium, performs just as well as a large bet because it can induce bluffs (raises, in this case) and light calls, including from hands that would have folded to a larger bet but could improve to something still worse on the turn.
A small bet is at least as consistent with how BTN would play some weak hands as checking is, and it has the added benefit of growing the pot. We have already seen how heavily even a small flop bet can increase your winnings on later streets compared to a check. KK is a good candidate for this play, just as it is for checking, because it blocks so many of the hands that would call a larger bet.
If BB calls this small bet, BTN can start growing the pot more dramatically with an overbet on the turn or continue ‚Äúslow-playing‚Äù with another smallish bet. KK is once again a better candidate than 99 for the slow-playing option because of its blockers.
Conclusion
Understanding the risks and rewards of slow-playing can help you better decide, in real-life game situations, which of these options is suitable with a given hand. As we saw in these examples, the equilibrium EVs often run quite close between checking, betting small, or betting large. But that does not mean they will actually be close against a human opponent!
Will this player check-raise as aggressively as a solver would against a small c-bet? Will they fire big bluffs, possibly even overbets, if you check the flop? Will big bets make them suspicious, such that they call down light?
Setting aside these human factors, there are structural considerations as well. Is a free card more likely to improve your opponent‚Äôs weakest holdings to second-best hands or to something stronger than your monster? How large is the pot? How much remains in the stacks? Do you block the hands most likely to play a big pot with you?
That‚Äôs a lot to consider, but the better you can manage that, the better your slow-playing decisions will be. But a good rule of thumb for slow-playing is: when in doubt, don‚Äôt. You want to play big pots with big hands, and the most straightforward way to do that is simply to bet or raise at every opportunity.
### TOPIC: stack to pot ratio
Stack-to-pot ratio
Stack-to-pot ratio, or SPR, is a way of measuring how deep the effective stack is and thus how strong of a hand will be required to risk that stack for a shot at winning the money already in the pot. It is, in other words, a calculation of risk and reward: the money in the effective stack is the most any player could be required to risk in order to win the reward, the pot.
Sometimes, especially before the flop, you may see the size of the stack expressed in big blinds rather than SPR, but this is a less useful metric. It can be downright misleading to talk about risk without considering reward.
SPR is defined as the effective stack (how much you can risk) divided by the pot:
Equity and SPR
With $100 in the pot, you see the flop against a single opponent, who promptly moves all-in for $100. What was the SPR at the moment you saw the flop, before your opponent bet? How much equity do you need to call the bet?
With $100 in the effective stack and $100 in the pot, the SPR was $100/$100 = 1. Calling this bet requires contributing $100 to a final pot of $300, so you would need $100/$300 = 33% equity.
If the SPR were 2, the bet would be $200, and you would need $200/$500 = 40% equity. At SPR 3, you would need $300/$700 = 43% equity to call a $300 bet. The more money you risk relative to what is already in the pot, the stronger a hand you must have to profit on the wager, (If you don‚Äôt understand these calculations, read this Pot Odds article first).
This has a compounding effect, because your opponents need stronger hands to risk their stacks as the SPR gets higher. At SPR 1, your opponent could go all-in with a flush draw, which typically has about 35% equity, even if she knew you were never going to fold. Because her range can contain relatively weak hands, your own relatively weak hands will more easily reach the 33% threshold.
At a higher SPR, you should expect your opponent‚Äôs hand to be stronger when her entire stack goes into the pot. That means not only do you need more equity to justify risking more money relative to the pot, but also that you are less likely to have that equity because your opponent‚Äôs range will be stronger.
Equity Required to Breakeven By SPR
The above chart reflects a scenario where all the money goes in at once, with no chance of a fold from either player. Breakeven Equity is defined as the pot odds required to call. At very low SPRs, that‚Äôs realistic.
As stacks get deeper, the betting usually happens in more complex ways. One player bets a combination of hands with good equity plus some that just want the opponent to fold. Then the opponent raises ‚á™, constructing her raising range with the same criteria, although she may not anticipate as much fold equity and must expect to be against a stronger range if her raise is called. Then the original player may go all-in, again banking on a mix of folds plus pot equity and taking into account that if his all-in bet is called, his opponent will probably have a strong hand.
Robustness
Some hands hold their equity better than others as the opponent‚Äôs range gets stronger. This attribute is often called ‚Äúequity retention‚Äù or ‚Äúrobustness‚Äù.
Against a range of any pair and any draw‚Äîthe sort of range with which an opponent might stack off at SPR 1‚Äîmiddle pair has pretty good equity. Against a range of top pair or better and only the strongest draws‚Äîa stack off range we might see at SPR 4‚Äîmiddle pair does not perform nearly so well. Bottom set has great equity against that SPR 4 stack off range, but at SPR 100 it should expect to be up against only higher sets, in which case it has just one out and so very poor equity.
The magic of draws is that, while they are rarely dominating favorites in the way that a set can be, their equity is robust. It does not drop off precipitously as the opposing range gets stronger. Consequently, at high SPRs, draws are often better hands for building pots via betting and check-raising than marginal hands like middle pair.
This is most true when the draw is to the nuts. Draws to weaker hands may still have robust equity against made hands, but they stack up poorly against stronger draws. As an opponent‚Äôs range gets stronger, draws to the nuts make up a larger part of it, increasing the likelihood that you lose the pot even if you complete your weaker draw and therefore reducing the equity of such hands.
Stacking Off at Low SPR
The chart below is from a BTN vs BB single raised pot, 14BB deep in an MTT, on a J‚ô• 8‚ô¶ 5‚ô• flop. After the pre-flop action, there are 5.5BB in the pot and 12BB in the effective stacks, for an SPR just over 2. Let‚Äôs examine BB‚Äôs response to BTN shoving the flop. Note that although the BTN rarely makes this bet at equilibrium, the solver strategy for responding to it is still valid.
Any top pair or better is good enough to stack off, even with no fold equity, as are most second pairs and even a few lower pairs (some third pair calls if it also has a backdoor flush draw). Most flush draws can call, though the very weakest fold. While nine outs alone would not yield the requisite 40% equity to call, most of these draws have some chance of winning by making a pair as well, or, in the case of the nut flush draw, by already having the best hand. Open-ended straight draws can call if they also have a backdoor flush draw, but even the best gutshots fold.
Stacking Off at Medium SPR
Let‚Äôs compare that result to the same situation with 30BB effective stacks, which yields an SPR of nearly 5:
At this higher SPR, stacking off with top pair starts to get a bit dicey, as does the nut flush draw. Open-ended straight draws are pure folds now, unless they also have a ‚ô• draw‚Äìbackdoor ‚ô¶ no longer cuts it.
In real-game situations, you are unlikely to face a 5x pot shove. It can be correct to stack off with some of these hands by calling several smaller bets or by raising, so that you can also benefit from fold equity. But this chart provides a nice demonstration of how stacking off standards get higher along with the SPR.
Stacking Off With Deep Stacks
Finally, we‚Äôll look at the same scenario with an SPR of 16:
All top pairs and all nut flush draws are now indifferent between calling and folding: even A‚ô•Jx is not a pure call. Many combo draws remain pure, however: 9‚ô•7‚ô•, 7‚ô•6‚ô•, and any second pair with a flush draw are profitable calls. This is a good example of robustness. These hands retain more of their equity as the opponent‚Äôs range grows stronger, whereas made hands with little chance to improve start to drop off in value. An opponent putting in 16x the pot will often have sets, overpairs, or two pairs against which top pair fares poorly.
Range Construction
This is not a perfect, apples-to-apples comparison. Both players‚Äô ranges for seeing the flop are slightly different at each SPR, as is the pot size (because the BTN uses slightly larger pre-flop raises with deeper stacks). But there is a lesson here as well: pre-flop ranges should be constructed with an eye toward post-flop play. The goal of NLHE is always to make a hand good enough to play for your entire stack, so it‚Äôs important to consider what ‚Äúyour entire stack‚Äù will mean in comparison to the pot.
At 14BB, for instance, the BB sometimes slowplays the biggest pocket pairs by just calling pre-flop. This is because she can anticipate a very low SPR even in a single raised pot, and overpairs can comfortably stack off at that depth.
As the stacks get deeper, the BB purely three-bets these hands pre-flop. Above SPR 4, stacking off with a single pair, no matter how strong, starts to get dicey. Thus, hands like KK, AA, and AK, which are very good at making one strong pair but rarely make anything stronger, prefer three-betting in part to ensure a lower SPR should they see a flop.
### TOPIC: turn cards
The Worst Turn Card
Greetings from GTO land. In today‚Äôs article, we will use the Turn Reports feature to gain a macro view of what turn cards are good and bad for us in a single-raised pot where the preflop raiser (PFR) is in position and made a flop c-bet, which out of position called.
For an in-depth view, we‚Äôll look across a few rainbow flops to see if we can spot any patterns that would benefit our big-picture learning. These studies are 100bb cash games, although some patterns will also apply to tournament situations.
Scenario 1: K72r, BTN vs BB SRP
The bread-and-butter situation of poker. We raised preflop on the Button, our opponent called from the Big Blind, and now we find ourselves in the advantageous situation of being the preflop raiser in position.
The first flop we‚Äôll look at is K‚ô†7‚ô•2‚ô¶:
This is a flop where BTN doesn‚Äôt mind using a small c-bet with a large portion of their range. It‚Äôs difficult for BB to defend on this board being out of position without natural calling hands like flush/straight draws, so they actually still end up overfolding against a small bet.
So we c-bet 33% pot and BB calls. In that split second before the dealer burns and turns the fourth community card‚Ä¶
Quiz 1
Try ranking these turn cards in order of equity for BTN (highest equity first). Since the board is rainbow, suits make a very small difference in this analysis.
Ten
Ace
Five
King
Did you give it a try? I‚Äôm guessing that most of you would have thought that the Ace is the best card for BTN‚Äôs range equity-wise, while some of you might have guessed that the King is a very poor card for the BTN. So you might have answered: Ace, Ten, Five, King.
Well, the correct answer might surprise you because the actual ranking given by the Wizard for BTN‚Äôs equity is Ten, Ace, Five, King.
One Turn at a Time
The following chart displays BTN‚Äôs equity by turn card (green is the best, red is the worst):
Let‚Äôs start with the Ten. Not only does it help BTN‚Äôs backdoor flop barrels such as AJ, QJ, and 98, but it also misses BB‚Äôs flop check-call range. It‚Äôs difficult for BB to have hands that took the check-call line and improved on the Ten. Overall, the offsuit T‚ô£ is the best card for BTN‚Äôs range, giving BTN 49.9% equity.
As we can see, BB would have preferred to play their backdoor combo draws‚Äîsuch as QJs, 98s, and J9s‚Äîas flop check-raises. These hands don‚Äôt quite have enough showdown value to be played as a check-call on the flop, so the solver prefers to treat them as semi-bluffs with some ability to continue on backdoor straight/flush turns. Thus, these cards will appear with reduced frequency in BB‚Äôs turn range.
BB‚Äôs flop strategy when BTN makes a small c-bet:
Note how J9s, 98s, and QJs all do some check-raising, reducing their combos in the flop check-call line.
Next, we come to the Ace. When the Ace turns up, BTN retains 45.9% equity. It‚Äôs not as good as we think because there‚Äôs a small (6.8%) percentage of Ace-highs that the BTN would play as a check-back on the flop, having enough showdown value and being at that threshold where betting puts us up against too strong of a range.
Let‚Äôs compare BTN‚Äôs c-betting range against BB‚Äôs flop calling range.
The Ace is not as bad for BB as we think. BB actually plays most of their Ace-decent kicker hands (AQ‚ÄìA8) as check-calls on the flop. They have just enough showdown value to proceed as calls.
The threshold for BB check-calling the flop seems to be that A8o can check-call, while A6o becomes a check-fold. That‚Äôs because A8o gives us an additional overcard against the 7-x in BTN‚Äôs range.
Here, we use the ‚ÄòRanges‚Äô tab to examine the top pairs in each player‚Äôs range on the turned Ace. Note that BB has a top pair advantage.
When the Ace hits, BB has 38 combos of top pair as compared to BTN‚Äôs 72. However, because BB‚Äôs range is much narrower, whereas BTN c-bet flop with a large portion of their range, BB actually has a higher percentage of combos of top pair. The important thing when understanding hand classes is not absolute combo count but how often they occur in each player‚Äôs range.
The important thing when understanding hand classes is not absolute combo count but how often they occur in each player‚Äôs range.
For example, you have 6 combos of nuts on the river. That doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot until you realize you reach the river with just 3 combos of air. Suddenly, 6 combos of nuts become a lot because they make up 2/3 of our range! In a different situation, you raise preflop with 500 combos of hands, of which only 6 are the preflop nuts AA. Now, 6 combos seem very little.
Next up, let‚Äôs examine a brick, the offsuit 5. The 5‚ô£ drops BTN‚Äôs equity to just 44.5%!
BB has more two pair combos on a turned 5.
The 5 is a bit worse for BTN than the Ace because BB turns more two pair combos and sets of 55. Unlike earlier turn cards, where the BB wouldn‚Äôt have turned sets like TT or AA because those would have been three-bet preflop. In addition, since BTN‚Äôs range is naturally a bit more high-card heavy, the 5 doesn‚Äôt help the broadway part of BTN‚Äôs range‚Äîalthough it does help the wheel Aces
like A4s and A3s.
Hands like A3s and A4s now have a great barreling opportunity. However, these hands are just a small portion of BTN‚Äôs range.
The last card in the analysis for this board is the King, pairing the top card.
BB has a higher percentage of trips on the turned King.
If we just look at trips
combos, BB has a slight advantage‚Äîbut BTN has a fair amount of trips as well.
Even though both players can present similar nut combos, the King is still a poor card for BTN overall as BTN had quite a few backdoor draw type hands in their range. Hands such as T9, 86, and 65 were hoping for help on the turn which would then boost BTN‚Äôs equity (by either pairing up or picking up a draw).
The offsuit K‚ô£ is actually the worst of all Kings because it brought zero additional equity for any backdoor hands in BTN‚Äôs range.
Both BB and BTN have ‚Äònut‚Äô combos with 90+% equity against an opponent‚Äôs entire range, so BTN doesn‚Äôt enjoy a clear nut advantage anymore.
I found the equity distribution graph very useful for understanding this spot. On the turned King, BB and BTN both have nutted hands in their range. In this case, our definition for ‚Äònutted‚Äô is King-x and better, which has 90+% equity against an opponent‚Äôs entire range.
However, BTN‚Äôs equity, as shown by the dark green line, is almost always behind.
BTN has a tough time because they need to polarize their range between strong hands and air for the most part, but BB can easily defend with ample combos of King-x. This would be less of an issue if BTN has enough ‚Äòultra-nutted‚Äô hands in their range that beat BB‚Äôs nut range.
BTN‚Äôs Strategy by Turn Card
What can we conclude from the above studies?
We must be mindful of the ranges involved and understand how they interact with turn cards. Generally, the PFR likes to see bigger cards (9 and above).
Overcards are generally slightly better for the preflop raiser than BB.
Low cards, like the 5, are not so good for the PFR.
When our opponent lacks the nutted hands to counter aggression, an overbet may be a better idea than a more common ‚Öî pot bet. I call this a ‚Äògreen light‚Äô to be selectively aggressive.
Board-pairing cards are pretty bad. On a turned King, we should be more cautious, as if we have seen an ‚Äòamber light‚Äô, and reduce our barreling frequency accordingly.
There‚Äôs some correlation between our equity and our betting frequency, although it‚Äôs also influenced by both players‚Äô nut ranges.
Regardless of the turn, we usually won‚Äôt use a ‚Öì size on the turn IP on rainbow boards. Our value hands want to bet bigger and if we have marginal showdown value hands, checking is higher EV than making a small bet. Thus, our decisions should be between checking or betting larger (66% to 125-150% pot).
Let‚Äôs take a quick look at a few different flops to see if our analyses hold true.
Scenario 2: J85r
As the ‚ÄòGeneral‚Äô strategy for this J‚ô†8‚ô•5‚ô¶ flop involves quite a few different bet sizes, for the sake of this study, I used the ‚ÄòSimplified GTO IP‚Äô setting, which restricts BTN to only use a 33% pot c-bet sizing on the flop. It‚Äôs not a pure c-bet range spot.
The data from this flop is slightly different. The following chart displays BTN‚Äôs equity by turn card after betting 33% on J85r:
Turn equity for BTN (green is best, red is worst)
The worst turn card for BTN is not a board-pairing card but actually the 2 (although it‚Äôs close). Generally, all the low cards are bad for BTN in this scenario.
The best turn cards for BTN include the King, Ace, and Queen. An observable trend with overcards is starting to appear. That makes sense because we c-bet a lot of hands like KQ, KT, QT, and Q9, which turned top pair or a draw. It‚Äôs also harder for BB to check-call King-x than Ace-x on J85 with poor showdown value, so the King is slightly better for BTN than the Ace.
BTN will almost always choose to c-bet 1 overcard+gutshot hands like QT and Q9.
Cards like the Ten or 9 are okay because we usually c-bet the straight draws, and now we turned the nut straight or made a pair to go along with our straight draw, while BB tends to check-raise hands like QT/Q9 vs our small c-bet. Moving toward the bottom, the board-pairing cards are pretty bad, as is the case for the bricks (3 and 2). Comparing the 2 to the King, it‚Äôs much easier for BTN to have hands like QT (improved straight draw), AT (overcard with gutshot) than a hand that improved on the turned 3.
My observations from the above data:
Overcards are great for the BTN.
Again, there‚Äôs some correlation between BTN‚Äôs equity and betting frequency.
An overbet is a good idea when our opponent‚Äôs hands don‚Äôt improve, even when it doesn‚Äôt improve us either. This is true for both the King and the 2.
When a card comes that changes the board and helps both players, a large bet is generally better than an overbet.
This study is a bit simpler because we could see at a glance that the higher the turn card, the better our equity.
One last study before we go.
Scenario 3: T32r
Similar to J85r, I had to use a simplified bet size simulation on the flop for IP to make the data more presentable. The ‚ÄòGeneral‚Äô solution uses quite a few bet sizes for IP, including an overbet on the flop.
Let‚Äôs try and group the turn cards into categories for easier understanding:
Broadway overcards (Jack, Queen, King)
Pairs the top card (Ten)
In-between cards (7, 8, 9)
Improve straight equity (4, 5, 6)
Overcard but also improves bottom straight connectivity (Ace)
Pairs the bottom/middle pairs (2, 3)
Here‚Äôs a logical way to try and sort these categories before looking at solver output by equity for BTN:
As we saw earlier, the face cards
(overcards to the board) will almost always be good for BTN and poor for BB. So it should be safe to put the Jack/Queen/King in first place equity-wise.
Pairing the top card seems bad in this situation. BB won‚Äôt be check-raising much T-x, probably only AT and KT sometimes, so we can expect BB to have more T-x. Our barreling hands also missed completely. So we could put it in last place equity-wise.
Pairing the lower cards will be bad for BTN because our backdoor barrels didn‚Äôt improve, but the good news is it didn‚Äôt improve BB that much either. BB shouldn‚Äôt have much 2-x and 3-x. So the 2 and 3 should be a bit better than the dreaded Ten.
On the turned Ten, BB has a higher percentage of all pair-type hands except overpairs.
Comparing the 7, 8, and 9 to the 4, 5, and 6, it seems like the higher cards will have more value to BTN.
On a turned 9, BTN will have many hands with improved equity, such as QJ, KJ, 87, J8. Even picking up a pair of 9‚Äôs with hands like K9/Q9 is okay for us. A turned 5 improves much fewer hands in our range, only 55 and T5s, possibly 76s that picks up a gutshot. BB on the other hand, is going to have 64s, 53s, and 52s in their range. So the smaller cards won‚Äôt be as good for us.
What about the turned Ace? The Ace is unique in this situation because it gives us a lot of top pair combos but also boosts wheel straight connectivity. Both players can have 54, A3, AT, A2. Only BTN will have the stronger Ace-x like AJ‚ÄìAK and of course AA. It also improves broadway straight connectivity, aiding some of BTN‚Äôs hands like KJ/KQ, but BB should have those in some percentage as well.
BTN will enjoy the lion‚Äôs share of top pair-good kicker hands on the turned Ace.
However, BB will still have enough weaker Ace-x and turned two pair combos to not be totally overwhelmed by BTN on this turn.
It‚Äôs difficult to estimate without looking at the data, but I would rank the Ace somewhat above the 4/5/6 category, but below the Jack/Queen/King category.
Let‚Äôs look at the results:
BTN Turn Equity (green is best, red is worst)
Finally, a brief look at GTO betting strategies for BTN on the turns, along with a friendly reminder that these frequencies are guidelines and not rules to be strictly followed in-game:
Some takeaways from this flop study:
Once again, there is a clear correlation between BTN‚Äôs equity and betting frequency.
Most people don‚Äôt use an overbet here often enough. Since BTN bets 33% pot on the flop, BB‚Äôs check-calling range is fairly weak, and BTN has a lot of incentive to start polarizing and making bigger bets on the turn. Maybe something to look out for in your next session?
The exception to the overbetting pattern occurs on a turned Ten, pairing the top card. BTN should almost never overbet; BB has more ‚Äònut‚Äô combos. Instead, a 66% bet size is more profitable, even with a hand like 44 that can expect calls from Ace-highs.
Putting Data Into Practice
Studies like this are where a solver really shines in assisting human understanding. As humans, we can‚Äôt objectively state that a turned Queen is better than a turned 9 without using some sort of range calculation tool.
If I could choose just one learning point to take away from this article, it‚Äôs that:
Generally, high turn cards are going to be better for the PFR, and low cards or board-pairing cards are going to be poorer for the PFR, in an IP vs OOP caller situation.
Along with the data on betting frequencies, you should now have a better idea of when we have a ‚Äògreen light‚Äô to be aggressive and when we have an ‚Äòamber light‚Äô where it might be better to tone down the aggression.
On the flip side, if we observe that our opponent is not respecting some turn cards where their equity is very poor, we may be able to play back at them by check-raising more or always check-calling hands that would ordinarily be indifferent bluff catchers.
I would venture further and suggest that most opponents at lower stakes are not aggressive enough even on good turns. For example, on T32Tr, the solver suggests to keep betting all our 44‚Äì99, which I‚Äôm confident many people don‚Äôt do. Consequently, since they removed thin value from their range, our worst bluff catchers become calls. But this is a topic for another day.
Whenever we want to study exploitation, I suggest first understanding the GTO baseline, and then understanding how your opponents are falling short. Good luck at the tables everyone.
### TOPIC: turn play in 3bet pot oop
Mastering Turn Play in 3-Bet Pots OOP
Playing the flop OOP in a 3-bet pot can be challenging. Turn play, however, is what gets the heart pumping. As the pot gets bigger, mistakes become more costly. But don‚Äôt worry; this article covers everything you need to start crushing your opponents in 3-bet pots OOP on the turn as the preflop aggressor (PFA). Once you understand how to approach the turn, you‚Äôll become much tougher to play against. Let us dive right into it!
Impact of Flop Play
What drives turn decisions? One factor is SPR. How much is still in your stack compared to what has been relinquished to the pot can dictate:
Bet sizing
Betting frequency

Which hand classes we want to bet
A second factor, this time of the exploitative kind is our opponent‚Äôs tendencies. These can be categorized, for example, as too aggressive or too passive, and they can take different forms in game, like raising too much or calling too much respectively. The resulting changes can have dramatic effects in the construction of our turn approach.
However, one factor that many players seem to forget is the impact of flop strategy.
To illustrate that, let‚Äôs take a look at the following 3-bet cash game spot between SB and BTN with 100bb starting stacks:
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs c-bet flop strategy vs BTN on AK2tt: 100bb effective
As we can see, the SB prefers a smaller sizing with hands like weaker Ace-x, second pairs, AA/KK. And a larger one with strong top pairs and our lowest pocket pairs (to fold out higher pocket pairs very frequently and deny equity more effectively).
The implication of sizing hand classes differently on the current street is that we arrive with different ranges on the next street depending on the chosen bet size.
In this case, the ranges will look differently depending on whether we bet small (20% pot) or larger (75% pot) on the flop. On a more detailed level, there are two consequences:
Different ratios of certain hand classes in lines when we arrive on the turn. Sometimes, there could even be a complete lack.
Different responses by Villain and turn arriving ranges versus both sizes.
Let‚Äôs compare both turn strategies on a rainbow King to clarify how vital our flop strategy is to understand the approach to the next street.
The turn matchup: SB vs BTN on AK2tt Kr (K rainbow) after c-betting flop 20% pot (left) compared to 75% pot (right)
One thing stands out immediately:
We retain the equity and nut advantage after betting 20% on the flop, while we lost both after betting 75%. The reason is simple: We are not sizing up with any King-x, Aces, or Kings while our opponent is always pure calling all AA and King-x.
Various elements stand out. Let us jump into the turn-betting strategy on a King for both sizes to find out what it is!
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs turn strategy vs BTN on AK2tt Kr after flop went B20-C (left) compared to B75-C (right)

Turn Brick
In this spot specifically, when splitting our range on the flop into multiple sizes, we bet more frequently on average after using the bigger size because our range is simply much stronger and keeps the advantage on bricks. Across all turns, we bet 63.4% on average after the larger flop bet and only 46.7% after the smaller flop bet. One element that contributes to the frequency drop is the SB not wanting to bet worse than top pair in the small bet line on the turn because there is no merit in betting King-x on a brick due to no relevant equity denial, and we don‚Äôt get enough calls from worse.
(Play around a little; check the turn reports after betting 20% compared to 75%).
Turn Pairs the Middle Flop Card
On a King, however, our barreling frequency after c-betting 20% on the flop is much higher than after betting 75%.
As mentioned, we are arriving with way fewer trips and AA on the turn than our opponent, which means a King is a much better card for the BTN when c-betting flop for 75%.
The second point is that we size multiple hand classes differently on the turned King after c-betting flop for 20%. Stronger Ace-x has enough equity after betting small (e.g., A9s still has 56.8% equity) and gets called by all worse Ace-x, some pocket pairs, and most draws. Trips, generally, want to see the pot grow bigger and so prefer a more extensive sizing.
However, after betting more polarized on the flop, we mainly just use one medium sizing. AT and worse Ace-x don‚Äôt even have 45% equity anymore. The turn is a much worse card for us, as the SB, after using a large flop size, which results in us wanting to avoid betting more frequently. We also heavily filtered Villain‚Äôs range on the flop because they had to fold more versus the larger sizing (75%). We can‚Äôt use a large sizing on the turn anymore because we lost the nut advantage for the mentioned reasons.
All of the above precisely shows why our flop strategy significantly impacts our turn approach and how important it is to grasp how the ranges look after arriving on the turn.
About the Practicality of These Theoretical Concepts
So far, we learned how different flop strategies can impact our turn approach. However, playing a multi-size strategy will massively increase your game plan‚Äôs complexity. Even some high-stakes regulars use a one-size strategy before the river. In most cases, you can simplify your strategy to a great extent without significant EV loss by sticking to only one size before the river. When doing so, finding a fitting turn size can be tricky, but don‚Äôt worry. I will show you how to do that in the following examples.

Turn Arrival After Flop C-bet
As we just saw how important it is to really master the flop before having a chance to understand the turn, you may feel like revisiting OOP flop play in 3-bet pots first. If so, enter through this portal to backtrack your steps to the flop before exploring the deeper waters of turn strategy.
When we consider all the possible flops followed by different turns, organizing our thoughts and building a solid strategy may seem impossible. That‚Äôs why we must simplify our game plan by focusing on spotting patterns and building strong heuristics.
Creating groups that summarize different turn cards is an effective method. The most basic turn grouping is splitting all turn cards into two categories:
Brick ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt shift the nut advantage
Nut changing ‚Äì shifts the nut advantage
We need to go further, though, as this is abstracting too much nuance away. The following turn groups represent a good overview:
When you become more experienced, you can build subgroups to get progressively more detailed. For example, different pairing turn groups, such as paired top cards, paired middling cards, and paired low cards. But the above has more than enough meat on it to sink your teeth in.
To get familiar with analyzing turn play as the OOP 3-bettor, we will dive into two specific turn groups from the perspective of the SB 3-bettor versus BTN caller after c-betting the flop.
Group 1) When the Turn Bricks
For simplicity‚Äôs sake, we will use the simple solution. The first significant turn group is ‚Äúbricks,‚Äù turn cards that don‚Äôt significantly change the board texture or shift the nut advantage. To illustrate that group, we will look closely at K‚ô•Q‚ô•4‚ô£ 2‚ô¶.
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs turn strategy vs BTN on KQ4tt 2r after c-betting 33% on the flop
Looking closely, two things stand out instantly:
We mainly use one larger sizing.
We check almost half of our range.
But why is that? To understand the strategy, we will dissect the turn on a more detailed level with the help of the EQ buckets.
EQ buckets on KQ4tt 2r (left = SB, right = BTN)
Again, two things stand out:
Best and worst hands ‚Äì The SB has proportionally more best hands (at least 75% EQ), but the same goes for trash hands (at most 33% EQ).
Good and weak hands ‚Äì The BTN has an advantage in good and weak hands (33‚Äì75% EQ).
The SB has a massive advantage at the top of the range but is dominated when we compare the mediocre range part. This illustrates why the SB wants to use one larger size on the turn.
Due to the nut advantage, the SB is allowed to polarize.
OOP intends to build the pot as efficiently as possible. A geometric bet size
is often the solution or close to it. Betting geometrically maximizes the EV because it generates the most comprehensive minimum defense frequency
whilst getting stacks in by the river. A geometric bet size occurs as 3e (betting roughly the same fraction of the pot on all three streets to get stacks in on the river) or 2e (after two streets, usually on the turn and river).
Same Spot, Twice as Deep (200bb)
To clarify the geometric sizing even more, let‚Äôs examine the same spot but at a depth of 200bb deep.
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs turn strategy vs BTN on KQ4tt 2r after c-betting 33% on the flop 200bb deep
Instead of the 66% pot sizing, we now want to overbet to get the money in smoothly by the river. We do not need to match the turn and river sizing exactly, but by using roughly the same % pot size on the turn as on the river, we ensure we get stacks in as effectively as possible.
There are boards where we would benefit from two sizes. For instance, on K65 2, we have an advantage in the middle region because we have more 99‚ÄìQQ. One behavior seems to be persistent, though. After retaining the nut advantage on the turn, at least one part of the range always wants to polarize. To avoid overcomplicating our strategy, we can stick to one large turn size on bricks, as long as it doesn‚Äôt lose a significant amount of EV. The better you become and the more formidable your opponents, the more important it is to split your range in certain spots because small potential EV losses are far more likely to become actual losses, and giving up these ‚Äúmarginal‚Äù gains will be more critical versus an excellent opponent.
2) Playing Nut-Shifting Turns
The PFA does not always retain the nut advantage on the turn, though. When it shifts toward the preflop defender, exciting things happen. Let‚Äôs check that out on K‚ô•Q‚ô•4‚ô£ 9‚ô• flush (and straight) completion.
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs turn strategy vs BTN on KQ4tt 9t after betting 33% on the flop.
We can notice what changed on a wet turn compared to the previous brick turn when we look closer. We want to use a small size only. But why is that? The equity buckets will help us figure that out!
EQ buckets (left = SB, right = BTN)
Hand buckets (left = SB, right = BTN)
The EQ buckets show us how massively the SB‚Äôs advantage faded away. There is no more asymmetry in the nutted region. Both players have roughly the same amount of good and best hands. The BTN even has an advantage in flushes and straights. This means the SB can‚Äôt polarize its range due to the lack of nut advantage. The SB must be cautious and no longer seek to build a big pot. The result is a slight increase in checking and only using a small sizing because they still would like to bet hands worse than flushes and not build the pot versus a range that contains a lot of nuts. When there is still a decent amount of the stack behind relative to the pot (2x or more) and strong hands are equally distributed, we can simplify our turn strategy to a small size only or even check our entire range when the nut advantage clearly shifts in BTN‚Äôs favor.
What if the Flop Checked Through?
While c-betting the flop is the most common line, we also want to prepare for other scenarios. We will examine three common turn situations after the flop got checked through.
1) Nuts Unchanged ‚Üí Pure Polarization
To illustrate the first scenario, we take a closer look at T‚ô•8‚ô†4‚ô¶ 2‚ô£.
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs turn strategy vs BTN on T842r (after the flop went X-X)
What do you notice?
We very clearly only want to use one sizing here.
We quite frequently use an overbet.
All hands with more than 79% EQ are strong enough to overbet for value. Even 99 (79.8% EQ), an underpair to the Ten, can overbet. The BTN frequently stabs with top pairs and better on the flop, resulting in 99 being ahead of over 90% of the Villain¬¥s range on the turn.
To find out why, let us inspect the ‚ÄúRanges‚Äù tab.
EQ buckets & chart on T842r (SB = left, BTN = right)
As so often, the EQ buckets and chart will help us understand:
The SB has a notable advantage in very strong hands above 80% EQ.
The BTN, on the other hand, has a hefty advantage in good hands between 50‚Äì75% EQ.
When we explore even more, we find out that 66/77 and all second pairs (8-x) make up not more than 8.5% of SB‚Äôs range. If we consider all pairs below top pair, we still only get to 14% of that range.
.
These are all indicators of a polarized strategy. The SB has an advantage in the best hands. The range part that would benefit from protection and requires a smaller sizing (66/77/8-x) is so tiny that we don‚Äôt bother building a strategy around it. Another reason is that we are heavily dominated in the buckets between 50% and 75%. Building a pot for that part of the range doesn‚Äôt benefit us.
These polarized turn spots after the flop was checked often occur on middling/low boards, where we are supposed to check a decent amount of our range on the flop due to poor board connectivity. The consequence is that we have to check a considerable amount of overpairs as well. SB‚Äôs range is mainly built around the Broadway region and good pairs, meaning no significant part of the range would require protection, such as lower pocket or third pairs. The natural result on any non-nut-changing turn is that we polarize our strategy to get all the chips in by the river. The most effective way is, again, a geometrical sizing. The simple solution offers 130% pot; the optimal sizing would be close to the pot to have roughly the same sizing behind to generate the widest overall minimum defense frequency (MDF) to get stacks in by the river.
2) Nuts Unchanged ‚Üí Multiple Range Parts Bet
Our turn strategy after the flop went check-check is not always as straightforward as in the previous example. Let‚Äôs check out K‚ô•6‚ô•5‚ô¶ 2‚ô£ to understand those spots better.
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs turn strategy vs BTN on K65tt 2r (after the flop went X-X)
Unlike in our spot before, we heavily mix our strategy now:
One of the range parts wants to polarize
And the other wants to block
This one looks tricky, but don‚Äôt worry; we will better grasp the spot by inspecting the ranges tab.
EQ buckets & chart on K65tt 2r (SB = left, BTN = right)
Who the advantage has in which EQ bucket:
SB has more ‚ÄúBest hands,‚Äù similar to the previous spot.
SB also has more 70‚Äì80% EQ hands, unlike the previous spot.
Taking a closer look at the hand filters on the right reveals that we have almost twice the number of underpairs, second and third pairs.
These all indicate that we want to bet different hand classes for various reasons.
Large polarizing bets with strong top pairs and better, aiming to get all the money in by the river.
The EQ chart shows significant domination in the middling to the upper EQ parts. All those hands (underpairs like 77‚ÄìQQ) benefit greatly from protection and thin value.
Conclusion: Other than in the previous spot, we have an extensive range part that we want to bet for on the smaller side.
As we discussed before, we can stick to one-sizing the turn to ensure consistency in our strategy. Using custom solutions is an effective way to determine what sizing is preferred. When we clearly want to use multiple sizes, a proper simplification is picking a size you can bet your weakest value hand with.
3) Nuts Changed ‚Üí Top Range Parts Become Symmetric
A significant change in nuts can greatly influence our strategy.
The SB 3-bettor‚Äôs turn strategy vs BTN on K65tt 2t (after the flop went X-X)
Looking at the picture, we can instantly see a big difference from the previous spot.
We check considerably more, almost 80% of our range.
We mainly use a sizing on the smaller side.
EQ buckets & chart on K65tt 2t (SB = left, BTN = right)
Examining the equity buckets reveals a symmetry in strong and nutted hands. The consequence is that the SB can‚Äôt polarize due to lacking a nut advantage, resulting in a significant increase in checking and only using a small sizing. The SB still wants to bet hands worse than flushes but not build the pot versus a range that has a high concentration in nutted hands. A great heuristic is to increase the checking frequency relative to the amount of nuts in our opponent‚Äôs range.
Conclusion
Playing the turn in 3-bet pots OOP as the aggressor can be challenging. Every challenge is a new opportunity to become more competent and robust. Following these principles for turn play OOP in 3-bet pots can set you on your path to mastery.
Our flop strategy significantly impacts our turn approach. Grasping how the ranges look after arriving on the turn is crucial to understanding how to proceed on the turn.
Building turn groups helps you gain traction on all the possible fourth street cards.
Polarize your range while holding the nut advantage and use a geometrical size to get stacks in on the river.
Be more cautious on nut-changing turns, especially when your opponent gets hold of the nut advantage.
Splitting your range into multiple sizings is not necessary before the river.
Polarize your range with a large size when you have an advantage in the nutted region while being behind in the mediocre region or simply not having a considerable number of them.
Pick the size that fits your weakest value hand in spots where you want to use multiple sizes.

### TOPIC: turn probe bet
The Turn Probe Bet
What, No C-Bet?
Imagine yourself defending as the BB caller vs BTN preflop raiser in a 100bb cash game pot. After calling the raise, the flop is dealt: T72r. This board is neither particularly good nor bad for either player. We start with a check, expecting a continuation bet. Against this bet, we can choose to fold, call, or raise, depending on our read on the situation.
Instead of c-betting, our IP opponent elects to check back the flop. In HUD
terminology, you would see this statistic labeled as ‚ÄòMissed C-Bet.‚Äô This is unfamiliar territory for many players, given c-betting too often is the norm nowadays. Thus, if you see someone toning back on the c-bets, they could either be too passive or someone who has studied with solvers and has a somewhat balanced check-back range.
The fourth community card hits the felt, and we, as the OOP player, make a bet on the turn. (this is known as a ‚ÄòTurn Probe
‚Äò in HUD terms). What information should we use that could help us construct a +EV betting strategy in terms of size and frequency?
Before we make our decision, let‚Äôs rewind to the flop. When our opponent checks back, we now have some additional information on them without needing to look at a solver solution.

Range Deficiencies
We can say that our opponent‚Äôs range is somewhat capped. It contains very few nutted hands because they like to see the pot grow, and so would‚Äôve made a c-bet most of the time. If the postflop betting action doesn‚Äôt start immediately at the flop, building a big pot by the river becomes much harder. Thus, we can confidently exclude many combos of hands, such as overpairs, sets, and top pairs. We can see this by looking at BTN‚Äôs c-betting strategy. We always c-bet KK, QQ, JJ, our sets, and many of our better top pairs.
BTN‚Äôs detailed c-betting strategy on T72r
In many live games, you could almost say with 100% certainty that overpairs or sets won‚Äôt be checked back on a T72r flop when in position, although sometimes tricky players will know that checking back top set makes some sense since they block a lot of our top pair combinations that continue against a bet.
For draws, there aren‚Äôt that many on this board, but I expect most players to always c-bet their straight draws. Intuitively, it feels awkward to check back a hand like 98 or J9 and face a bet on the turn since calling with a draw feels quite bad, and raising doesn‚Äôt seem to represent a good hand credibly.
As such, most players choose to take the easier route out and always continue betting the obvious draws. On boards with many draws like J86tt, most people will always c-bet when they are the preflop raiser and have a frontdoor flush and/or straight draw. Do observe for yourself if this is true at your games.
In terms of hands that do check back, we might expect some pocket pairs below top pair, some Ace-highs like A8s and AJs that have reasonable showdown value, and the weakest hands that are essentially giving up on the pot like 54s, K5s that don‚Äôt have good enough barreling equity to work with.

What Turn Cards Do We Want?
BTN‚Äôs simplified (see ‚Äòaction grouping‚Äô setting) c-betting strategy on T72r
Indeed, the solver c-bets overpairs, top pair strong kickers, and straight draws at a very high frequency. So when our opponent checks back the flop, we should be able to take a guess at what turn cards are good and bad for the BB.
Straight-completing turn cards should be extremely good for the BB as BTN c-bet most of their straight draws. So, not only does BB have more straights but also more pair+draw type hands when not improving to the nuts on the turn. On a straight-completing card, we can expect a clear equity shift in favor of the Big Blind.
Turning an Ace should be quite bad for the BB. I can think of two reasons why this might be the case:
BTN should have checked back quite a fair amount of Ace-highs on the flop that have decent showdown value and don‚Äôt want to build a big pot or start ‚Äòbluffing.‚Äô These include their best Ace-highs like AK and AQ.
BB lacks the stronger Ace-highs because they would have 3-bet with them preflop.
Let‚Äôs look at the solver to see if our evaluation is valid. We‚Äôll be inspecting three (offsuit) turn cards: an 8 (completing a straight), an A (new overcard to the board), and a bricky 4.
Turn Reports
BB‚Äôs performance (measured in EV) on different turn cards (flop checked through)
Turn Reports help us see immediately that the Ace is by far the worst for BB in terms of both equity and EV. The above-average cards for OOP include 9, 8, Jack, and 6 (the straight-completing cards), as well as 4 and 5, which are clear bricks for IP.
Turn Reports help us see immediately that the Ace is by far the worst for BB in terms of both equity and EV.
The board-pairing turn cards such as 2, 7, and Ten are actually below average for BB; BB still has a lot of air, and IP still has a fair amount of decent equity hands like unimproved pocket pairs and Ace-highs that can withstand some pressure.
Some of you may think that the Ten is a very good card for BB‚Äîwhile BB certainly has a slightly higher percentage of Ten-x, we don‚Äôt have much of anything else. Also, the GTO solution sees BTN check back a fair percentage of Ten-x with weaker kickers.
BTN has more incentive to c-bet Queen-highs than King-highs since Queen-highs have less showdown value.
Turning a King is not great for BB because BTN still has quite a few K-highs that didn‚Äôt c-bet and backed into top pair.
Turning a Queen is a bit better. BTN has more incentive to c-bet Queen-highs than King-highs since Queen-highs have less showdown value. As such, there‚Äôs more EV in c-betting than checking back with Queen-high, and thus, BTN will have fewer top pairs on the turn card Queen.
We can see this trend more clearly when comparing the K6s‚ÄìK2s with Q6s‚ÄìQ2s. There‚Äôs a clear difference in c-bet frequency;
Q6s continuation bets almost ‚Öî of the time, while K6s only continues with a bet ‚Öì of the time.
Now that we know what cards are good and bad for BB in terms of EV, let‚Äôs look to construct our betting strategies. Should we use a small or large size when we probe bet, and how often can we do it? When is checking better? For these examples, I selected offsuit turn cards that don‚Äôt bring a backdoor flush draw.
Probing an 8: A Light Nudge Does The Trick
BB‚Äôs probe betting strategy on T728r
The solver likes to use a small and medium size on the turn when probing the 8. There‚Äôs also some larger betting with hands like AT, KT, and K9, but these hands could use a half-pot sizing just as well.
On this turn, we have an incentive to deny equity to random overcard hands in our opponent‚Äôs range, such as Ace- and King-highs. Most of our Ten-x and better are betting, and we have many good high-equity bluffs such as Jack-x, 9-x, and 6-x that can improve on the river when called. Our objectives here are value betting, denying equity, and semi-bluffing with decent draws.
A hand even as weak as third pair top kicker (A7), can do some small betting on the turn. This hand doesn‚Äôt want to face a big bet, gets called by worse like lower pocket pairs such as 55 and even KQo sometimes, so it gets a lot done with just a small bet.
Finally, the reason why a smaller size is preferred over a larger size is that our opponent‚Äôs range is simply very weak and behind a majority of BB‚Äôs range, with a lot of marginal hands that have a difficult time defending to even a small bet. For example, third pair top kicker (A7o) has 66% equity against BTN‚Äôs range.
In addition, remember that our opponent lacks a lot of ‚Äòstrong‚Äô bluff-catchers here. If our opponent‚Äôs range had a lot of overpairs and two pairs while we had a lot of straights, we could actually see some overbetting being done since this would be a polarized
‚Äònuts-or-air‚Äô situation. Instead, this is a situation where BB is more incentivized to construct their betting strategy linearly
One analogy appropriate for this situation would be that we don‚Äôt need to exert much pressure to push down a flimsy door.
One analogy appropriate for this situation would be that we don‚Äôt need to exert much pressure to push down a flimsy door. Instead, a light nudge is enough to get the job done. We could, of course, bet large and take down the pot very often, but that wouldn‚Äôt be the most +EV size for most of our betting range.
BB vs BTN on T728r
Around 73% of BTN‚Äôs range has less than 50% equity against BB‚Äôs range on the turned 8. Thus, a linear betting strategy is preferred from BB‚Äôs perspective.
Finally, betting small also gets us a bit of thin value from hands that don‚Äôt really want to call but have to, such as KQo, 66‚Äì33, and A2s.
Probing an Ace: The Kitchen Sink Or Nothing
Some players, when seeing an Ace on the turn, will make a small probe bet with a hand like A4 or try to make a ‚Äòblocker bet‚Äô with weaker hands like T9 so that they don‚Äôt have to face a big bet.
This is a big mistake. The turned Ace is extremely damaging to our equity, meaning we must play defense. Making a small blocker bet here doesn‚Äôt make sense because we‚Äôre bogged down by an equity disadvantage (BTN has 57% equity). BTN also has top pair 30% of the time here, so why are we continuing to put money in when the situation is so poor for us?
One thing that is true, however, is that BB has the nuts advantage with more two pair and set combinations than BTN. This gives us something to work with, even if our overall equity is at a disadvantage.
BB vs BTN on T72Ar
BB has 2% of sets and 5% of two pairs. Despite having fewer combos in most of the one pair departments and an overall equity disadvantage, BB can still make this situation work for them.
The way to do this is by using an overbet strategy. By polarizing their range between two pairs or better and air, BB maximizes their EV. They get more value from their nutted hands, and they force BTN into an uncomfortable bluff catching situation even with a hand that we would ordinarily consider strong, like top pair third kicker (AJs).
BB‚Äôs probe betting strategy on T72Ar
The actual size recommended by the solver is 13.7bb into a 5.5bb pot‚Äîthat‚Äôs a 250% pot bet! While we don‚Äôt necessarily have to use this size in a real-life game, it‚Äôs good to know that a bigger bet is much better than a small bet here.
BB‚Äôs 250% pot probe betting range
Hovering over the 250% bet option, we can see the range composition of this bet size. As expected, we have the ‚Äònuts‚Äô (two pair or better) or ‚Äòair‚Äò; we sometimes use 2-x like Q2 and K2 as a bluff. Otherwise, our bluffs are mostly sourced from straight draws like 53, 43, QJ, 86.
This bet is designed to make our opponent‚Äôs bluff catchers, such as AJ and A8, indifferent between folding and calling. It gets folds from everything else; KT and JT won‚Äôt even consider defending. In theory, our opponent also needs to defend hands like 54s and K2s sometimes to a 2.5x pot-sized bet!
If our opponent is a calling station and always calls our big turn bets with Ace-x, we can just bluff less. I would guess that most human opponents would over-fold here to this intimidatingly big bet. Thus, it might be reasonable to bluff a bit more than equilibrium. For example, GTO only bluffs about 25% of our J8, but we could start bluffing half of our combos. Just be aware that you‚Äôre deviating from the theoretical baseline and make sure you‚Äôre deliberate about it by having the reason why you‚Äôre deviating front of mind.
Probing a 4: An Assortment Of Sizes
The turned 4 is a brick for BTN that BB should feel happy about. Equities are fairly close, with BB holding 49% of equity. In terms of hand breakdowns, BB is doing slightly better, with more sets and two pairs and slightly more top pair combinations as well.
BB vs BTN on T724r
On one side, making an overbet is reasonable because we do have a slight nut advantage. Spontaneous thought might land at bottom set 22. On the other side, there are a lot of hands in our range that want to bet for thin value and protection but don‚Äôt necessarily want to bloat the pot. Hands like T9, 88, and 7-x come to mind. It doesn‚Äôt really make sense to start overbetting with second pair, so we need to consider having both a small and a large bet size.
BB‚Äôs probe betting strategy on T724r

Conclusion
Given how frequently people c-bet as the preflop raiser, it can be confusing when an opponent instead chooses not to. In a GTO context, we‚Äôve learned a few things about the probe bet:
Draw-completers are usually great for us. Since our opponent lacks a lot of strong hands, we generally gain more EV by forcing them to continue with hands they really don‚Äôt want to. A big bet would work, but a small bet wins more.
The turn being a big overcard, such as the King or the Ace, is very poor for the BB and very good for the BTN. If we do bet, we want to tell the story that we can beat whatever top pair they have made. This situation calls for a big bet and a big bet only. If we don‚Äôt have a value hand that can beat a turned top pair or a good bluffing candidate, we should just check.
A brick on the turn allows us to choose a few sizes. We have some marginal hands like weak underpairs that are likely good and are interested in betting for protection to deny equity to overcards. At the same time, we also have strong value hands like top pair top kicker that want to build a bigger pot. Since our bet sizes are driven by our value hands and we have different sorts of value, we use a variety of sizes.
Feel the urge to practice turn probe betting as BB against BTN with 100bb stacks in the app? Say no more, we already set up this drill for you.
The conclusions in this analysis were drawn under the assumption of a BTN using a GTO c-betting strategy. In real life, I expect that people always c-bet all their draws; so, on straight/flush-completing turn cards, it usually makes sense to be more aggressive than the solution suggests. Generally, people do still check back Ace-highs a fair bit on these lower flops, so the strategies we outlined for a turned Ace should still be effective.
Finally, against people who c-bet too often and so rarely allow us to probe the turn, we should simply check-raise them on the flop to infinity and beyond!

### TOPIC: turn probing
The Art of Turn-Probing: Exploiting Checked Flops
After calling a 3-bet as the out of position (OOP) player, you should expect to see a flop continuation bet from your in position (IP) opponent. In a 100bb CO vs BTN scenario, for example, BTN c-bets more than 80% of the time at equilibrium.
The 3-bettor, having taken on more risk preflop, arrives at the flop with a stronger range. On most flops, they will possess both an equity advantage and a nuts advantage, the combination of which facilitates aggressive continuation betting.
As the caller, you‚Äôll often end up check/folding or check/calling with the expectation that future streets will be tough to play. That‚Äôs not a failure of knowledge or strategy on your part; it‚Äôs merely the consequence of your bad luck for opening into a hand strong enough to 3-bet you.
But what happens when the IP raiser does not c-bet the flop?
Is the pot now yours for the taking?
Which turn cards will be better or worse for you to bet at?
How much should you bet?
With which hands?
This article will examine all that and more.

Aggregate Turn Strategy
For our examples, we will look at the CO vs BTN configuration, as it is the one that occurs most commonly. The general principles discussed here will apply to other configurations where the 3-bettor is in position as well, though, of course, the details will differ.
We can‚Äôt look at CO‚Äôs aggregate turn-probe strategy across all possible flops, so we‚Äôll instead look at their aggregate strategy on a variety of textures, all of which feature among BTN‚Äôs most checked flops. This is less of a compromise than it may seem because there are many flops on which BTN bets all or almost all of their range. Checking really is a notable exception for them; a significant part of their strategy only on specific board textures such as the ones that follow.
The major determinant of CO‚Äôs turn-probe frequency is how much equity they flop.
Here, we see a pretty sharp divide between boards where CO frequently probes the turn and boards where they are more judicious. The major determinant of CO‚Äôs turn-probe frequency is how much equity they flop: on boards where they flop half or more of the equity, they probe much more frequently than on those where they flop significantly less.
Higher frequency turn-bets also correlate with smaller bet sizes. This makes sense: a narrower range is generally a more polar range, which benefits from larger bet sizes.
These different probe sizes have fundamentally different purposes (dare I say targets?). Smaller bets pressure weak hands in BTN‚Äôs range, hands which could easily be drawing slim or dead, and so will struggle to continue profitably even when getting very good odds. Larger bets pressure medium hands, the sort that would happily call a smaller bet, but begin to worry about drawing dead when facing an overbet.
On more favorable (for IP) board textures, BTN usually c-bets their weakest hands, so a small probe from CO would not accomplish much. To the extent that they check, they are weighted toward medium hands, not weak ones.

Advanced equity buckets
Thus, when BTN does not c-bet these flops, CO still mainly checks the turn, often with the intention of giving up. When CO does probe, they either have a very strong hand or represent one with a bluff. This polar strategy pressures the mostly medium hands in BTN‚Äôs checking range.
On less favorable boards, BTN‚Äôs checks come disproportionately from their weakest hands. This is partly because they have flopped more weak hands on these boards and partly because they have more incentive to protect their medium hands with a bet. Unless the turn card is one of the few that dramatically improves the weak hands in BTN‚Äôs checking range, CO can probe with small bets to pressure those weak hands.
BTN‚Äôs Flop Strategy on 6‚ô•5‚ô•4‚ô¶
To be clear, there are still plenty of medium hands in BTN‚Äôs checking range on these less favorable flops, which is why CO‚Äôs equilibrium strategy still includes some polar betting. The biggest difference between BTN‚Äôs strategy on better and worse flops is the prevalence of weak hands in their checking range. That, in turn, accounts for the difference in CO‚Äôs use of small probe-bets.
Probing BTN‚Äôs Bad Flops
CO‚Äôs aggregate turn-probe strategy on 6‚ô•5‚ô•4‚ô¶ is a powerful demonstration of how starkly different the strategy is on BTN‚Äôs best turn cards:
CO‚Äôs aggregate turn-probe strategy on 654tt
When a card from the lower half of the deck turns, CO leads most or all of their range, usually for a small size. On an 8‚ô£ turn, for example, CO bets almost everything. The main exceptions are AJ and AQ, which both block and dominate BTN‚Äôs folds:
Manhattan plot: CO probe-bet turn strategy vs BTN on 654tt 8r
On low card boards, BTN‚Äôs checking range is full of unpaired hands that will struggle to continue even when getting a good price.
Notice also that CO‚Äôs large bets come almost exclusively from their strongest hands (straights and sets) and weakest hands. These weakest hands tend to be unpaired hands that can make dominating hands fold while retaining a few outs when called. This includes gutshots like T9s and K9s and flush draws like Q‚ô•J‚ô•.
High Turns
Aces and Kings are much better turns for BTN than even Queens or Jacks. On an Ace and King turn, CO rarely bets and strictly uses a larger, polarized sizing when they do bet. For example, when the A‚ô£ turns, CO bets 125% pot with about 13% of their range, including sets and two pairs for value and flush and straight draws as bluffs. These bluffs still have 25‚Äì50% equity; CO is not fighting for the pot with their very worst hands:
Manhattan plot: CO probe-bet turn strategy vs BTN on 654tt Ar
Probing BTN‚Äôs Better Flops
When BTN checks a favorable flop like A‚ô•8‚ô•7‚ô¶, it should (usually) not be because their hand is weak. Mostly, it should be because they have something medium like KK or QQ or A3. This has a few implications for CO‚Äôs probing strategy:
BTN‚Äôs checking range is full of bluff-catchers. With the added disadvantage of being out of position, CO can not expect to show a profit betting their worst hands on most turns. If CO were to bluff too much here, BTN could exploit them not only by bluff-catching but also by checking more traps on the flop.
When CO does bet, it should be for a size that puts those modest pairs to the test.
CO should probe less often on turn cards that improve the medium hands in BTN‚Äôs checking range.
The worst turns for CO to bet are Aces, Kings, Queens, Eights, and Sevens:
CO‚Äôs aggregate turn-probe strategy on A87tt
You might be accustomed to thinking it‚Äôs good for OOP when the turn pairs the second or third card, but that‚Äôs only if the preflop aggressor c-bet the flop. Because that c-betting range should be somewhat polar, cards that improve medium hands are bad for a c-bettor.
By that same logic, turn cards that improve medium hands are good for the preflop aggressor if they did not c-bet the flop. Their range is thick with hands like Q9, K8, and KK, which like seeing a board pair or a Broadway card roll off.
Flush and straight draws, on the other hand, are appealing c-betting candidates. That means BTN is less likely to have them after checking, so flushing and straightening turns are better cards for CO to probe. Very low cards also do not interact with BTN‚Äôs checking range, and so are good cards for CO to probe as well.
CO‚Äôs probe strategy on A‚ô•8‚ô•7‚ô¶ 3‚ô¶ looks much like their probe strategy for playing an Ace turn on a flop that‚Äôs less favorable to BTN. That is, CO bets big and polar, drawing their bluffs not from air but from draws. This particular board offers both heart and diamond draws, so the lowest-equity bluffs are poor straight draws like 6‚ô†5‚ô†, not complete air:
Manhattan plot: CO probe-bet turn strategy vs BTN on A‚ô•8‚ô•7‚ô¶ 3‚ô¶
If the 3 on the turn is a third ‚ô•, CO‚Äôs betting pattern looks quite similar, but the size of their bet shifts downward, preferring 75% pot to overbets. In fact, they use this smaller sizing on all heart turns:
Manhattan plot: CO probe-bet turn strategy vs BTN on A‚ô•8‚ô•7‚ô¶ 3‚ô•
Despite the incentive to bet flush draws on the flop, BTN does retain some in their checking range. Some of their medium hands also pick up flush draws, making them more comfortable calls even against overbets. However, the pairs that did not turn flush draws will have tough decisions even against the 75% pot bet, given how easily they could be drawing dead.
CO‚Äôs betting pattern is similar on a worse turn like the Q‚ô¶, but with less betting overall:
Manhattan plot: CO probe-bet turn strategy vs BTN on A‚ô•8‚ô•7‚ô¶ Q‚ô¶
It‚Äôs also worth noting that CO mixes 125% and 175% pot on the 3‚ô¶ turn but uses 125% exclusively on the Q‚ô¶. They simply don‚Äôt want to put as much money into the pot when the turn card is so likely to help their already somewhat strong opponent.
Conclusion
The 3-bettor will have a stronger preflop range than the caller. That translates into an equity advantage on most flops, which, combined with a positional advantage, discourages their opponent from contesting the pot with weak hands. Even when the 3-bettor checks the flop, it will often be correct for you to check and give up on the turn if you‚Äôve got nothing going on.
Just how much you need to have going on depends on the board texture‚Ä¶

### TOPIC: understanding blockers
Understanding Blockers in Poker
Often when looking through a solver‚Äôs meticulously crafted grid of deception, one of the following questions arises:
Why is the solver sometimes folding top pair while also sometimes calling third pair? Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to always call the top pair and always fold the third pair?
Why is bluffing this hand okay while bluffing another seemingly similar hand is a mistake?
Why is the solver choosing to raise a pair on the river as a bluff? Pairs have a showdown, shouldn‚Äôt we be raising our busted draws instead?
Did I buy the right types of cheese for lasagna dinner with the in-laws?
These are all excellent questions! ‚ÄìThe answer often comes down to blockers! Or mozzarella.
In this article, we‚Äôll cover what blockers are, how they impact your strategy, when they‚Äôre significant, and how to analyze your hands using GTO Wizard‚Äôs blocker analysis tools.

Understanding Blockers
In Poker, blockers refer to the card removal effect of holding a hole card that blocks a relevant portion of your opponent‚Äôs range. For example, if we hold A‚ô†K‚ô¶ on T‚ô†6‚ô†3‚ô†, we now make it impossible for our opponents to hold the nut flush‚Äì We ‚Äúblock‚Äù the nut flush. Unblockers, another important term, refer to the inverse effect. For example, if we hold 3‚ô•3‚ô£ on T‚ô†6‚ô†3‚ô†, we ‚Äúunblock‚Äù top pair, making it more likely to get value with the bottom set.
The first step to understanding blockers is understanding what our hand wants to accomplish
Different hand classes have different incentives.
When holding value, your hand wants to receive action. This hand class would ideally like to:
Block Trash
Unblock Value
When holding a potential bluff, we would prefer to see a fold. This hand class would ideally like to:
Block Value
Unblock Trash
When holding a bluff catcher, our hand wants to win more often than our pot odds dictate. This hand class would ideally like to:
Block Value
Unblock Trash
When holding a marginal-made hand, our hand would like to reach showdown as cheaply as possible. This hand class would ideally like to:
Block Bets
Unblock Checks
When holding a nutted hand, our hand wants to grow the pot as much as possible. This hand class would ideally like to:
Block Checks
Unblock Bets
Although your hand may not always possess the ideal blocking properties, you can still utilize card removal effects to make tough decisions by reframing blockers in terms of your hand‚Äôs objectives.

Analyzing Blockers
Now that we‚Äôve explored the concept of incentives, let‚Äôs review a few examples to see how to use blockers in practice. For this example, we will use a 100bb cash solution and play as the cutoff.
Preflop: Hero (CO) opens to 2.3bb with T‚ô†9‚ô† and the BB calls.
Flop (J‚ô†6‚ô•4‚ô†)(5.1BB): BB Checks to the Hero. Hero C-bets ¬Ω pot. BB Calls.
Turn (J‚ô†6‚ô•4‚ô†‚ÄìT‚ô£)(10.2BB): Action checks through.
River (J‚ô†6‚ô•4‚ô†‚ÄìT‚ô£‚Äì2‚ô£)(10.2BB): BB bets 6BB, action is on Hero.
Hero faces a 60% pot-sized bet with second pair. Would you?
Pure fold
Pure call
Mix call and fold
Mix call and bluff raise
T‚ô†9‚ô† is a pure fold according to the GTO Solution. However, T‚ô¶9‚ô¶ and T‚ô•9‚ô• are always calling!
So what‚Äôs the difference? Why does the solver prefer calling with some combinations of T9s but not others?
Let‚Äôs take a step back. Before we answer this question, we need to answer a larger question: First of all, Is T‚ô†9‚ô† a bluff-catcher?
If our hand doesn‚Äôt even beat bluffs then it cannot be considered a bluff-catcher. A great way to figure this out is by using the Breakdown tab, and filtering for Villain‚Äôs bet size, in this case, 6bb.

Villain‚Äôs River Bet Construction
Reading this chart, Villain never bluffs anything stronger than Ace High, and never value bets anything weaker than Top Pair for value in this line. Therefore, any hand between Ace High and Top Pair, including T‚ô†9‚ô†, is a potential bluff-catcher.
Okay, so this is a bluff-catching candidate. And we know other combinations of T9 call. So are there specific blocker properties that make T‚ô†9‚ô† a bad call? Let‚Äôs examine hero‚Äôs strategy facing the bet:
How about KTo? This pattern of folding spades continues! We fold KTo when holding the King of spades. So why is that?
The answer comes down to BB‚Äôs range. Many of the weakest hands in BB‚Äôs range consist of the bricked flush draw. These hands then bluff the river to win the pot. In the case of T‚ô†9‚ô†, holding the 9 of spades blocks BB‚Äôs bluffs like K‚ô†9‚ô†, Q‚ô†9‚ô†, 9‚ô†8‚ô†, and 9‚ô†7‚ô†.
Hands like T‚ô•9‚ô• and T‚ô¶9‚ô¶ unblock these bluffs, so they call instead.
This is reflected in the Trash Removal scores. T‚ô†9‚ô† removes more trash from the opposing range, meaning CO expects BB to be bluffing less often when we hold this hand.
We‚Äôll talk more about these scores later. But first, we need to address when these card removal effects become significant.

When do blockers matter?
In our example, the effects of blockers were quite significant, but this was by design. In many spots, the effects of blockers can be microscopic. As a human, we have to know when it‚Äôs appropriate to base a decision on blockers.
If our opponent isn‚Äôt bluffing enough, should we still call with good blockers and vice versa?
The most important part of any river bluff-catching decision is whether you have the equity dictated by your pot odds to call. Everything else is secondary.
Going back to our T‚ô†9‚ô† example, on the river, our pot odds dictate we need exactly 27.8% equity to make the call.
Required Equity = Call / (Pot after we call ‚Äì rake) ‚Üí 6 / (6 + 6 + 10.2 ‚Äì 0.6) = 27.8%
Click here to learn how to calculate pot odds.
As you can see, this is an extremely close decision. If the Big Blind was bluffing even 1% more, then T‚ô†9‚ô† would become a pure call.
Before calling, you need to ask yourself three questions in order of importance:
Do I beat bluffs?
Are they over-bluffing (call every time) or under-bluffing (fold every time) compared to the pot odds I need?
Does my hand block their value bets and/or unblock their bluffs?
The solver constructs a perfectly balanced strategy. Equilibrium is fragile. If you suspect that your opponent is over or under-bluffing, this supersedes blockers in nearly every spot. When up against strong players, it can be tough to tell if they are over or under-bluffing. This is when you should start basing decisions on blockers.

When Blockers Matter Most:
Ranges are narrow ‚Äì When a player has fewer combos in range, it makes sense that holding a key card will have a proportionally larger effect.
Ranges are polarized ‚Äì When a player is repping the nuts or nothing, a key blocker can make all the difference.
When facing a large bet ‚Äì You don‚Äôt have to defend as wide against a large bet compared to a small bet. For this reason, we can afford to be much more selective; only calling our best blockers.
Blocker Analysis Tools
Like lasagna, a good analysis is often layered and complex. GTO Wizard has a suite of tools for analyzing blockers. First, we‚Äôll learn about Wizard‚Äôs blocker scores, which are great for quick analysis. Then we‚Äôll move on to the blocker tab, a powerful tool for deep analysis. Lastly, we‚Äôll use these newfound skills to work through a tricky blocker question.
Blocker Scores
With any premium subscription, a blocker score will appear in the top left corner of any combo within range.
Value Removal denotes how much value you block in your opponent‚Äôs range. Trash Removal denotes how much trash you block in your opponent‚Äôs range.
Scores run on a scale of 0 ‚Äì 10; if you have a Value Removal score of ten, your bet will generate more folds than normal; if you have a Trash Removal score of 10, your bet will generate fewer folds than normal.
Blockers Tab
The Blockers tab can be easily accessed on the right side of the screen through both the Strategy and Ranges tabs.
In the Blockers tab, you can see how the absence of a particular hole card in your range will affect your overall frequencies. In the graphic below, our opponent has bet ¬æ pot. If the villain holds the 8 of clubs, our overall folding frequency will increase by 0.45%. This can be fantastic for discovering and understanding card removal dynamics.
If you ever get lost on this tab, remember, you can hover over any tile to get a helpful tip clarifying what a particular stat means.
Blocker Puzzle
Let‚Äôs return to the first example, this time holding T‚ô†7‚ô†.
Preflop: Hero (CO) opens to 2.3bb with T‚ô†7‚ô† and the BB calls.
Flop (J‚ô†6‚ô•4‚ô†)(5.1BB): BB Checks to the Hero. Hero C-bets ¬Ω pot. BB Calls.
Turn (J‚ô†6‚ô•4‚ô† ‚Äì T‚ô£)(10.2BB): Action checks through.
River (J‚ô†6‚ô•4‚ô† ‚Äì T‚ô£ ‚Äì 2‚ô£)(10.2BB): BB bets 6BB, action is on Hero.
In a bit of an anomaly T‚ô†7‚ô†, despite blocking the missed flush draw, seemingly prefers to call over its other T7‚ô† counterparts. Why? How should we go about solving this?
A great place to start is by looking at the blocker scores, where we see something odd‚Äì Ts7s has a lower trash blocker score than the other combos.
To figure out why, let‚Äôs go back to the flop action. Our first step is to look at all continuing combos that contain a 7 on the flop. After a bit of searching, we find that many of the continuing 7x hands are straight draws, specifically 87‚ô† and 87o.
Combos of 87 containing a spade make better bluff raises on the flop because they block more of our calls. Therefore, when BB bluffs the river they are less likely to do so with the 7 of spades compared to the 7 of diamonds, clubs, or hearts.
Let‚Äôs examine how holding the 7‚ô† changes CO‚Äôs response to a flop check-raise.
Here we can see that CO folds 0.72% more often to a flop raise if BB holds the 7‚ô†!
Let‚Äôs take a look at BB‚Äôs river betting range:
Since BB would have check-raised most of their 7‚ô† combos on the flop, they get to the river with fewer of these combinations. Therefore, When BB bluffs the river, they are less likely to do so with the 7 of spades compared to the 7 of diamonds or hearts. When CO holds T‚ô†7‚ô† they actually block fewer bluffs!

Summary
Blockers are a fundamental part of the game. Thinking about how your hand interacts with all other ranges is a crucial step in poker analysis.
Blockers refer to the card removal effect of a particular holding that blocks a relevant portion of your opponent‚Äôs range.
Reframe blockers by considering what your hand wants to accomplish.
Exploitative considerations are often more important than card removal.
Blockers matter most when ranges are tight.
When confused by an unintuitive blocker dynamic, use blocker scores and always look back to previous streets!
Make frequent use of the blockers tab‚Äì especially in 3-bet or 4-bet pots or where ranges are tight. This can make these tough spots significantly easier to learn!

### TOPIC: value betting
Reasons for value betting in poker

Sources of Value
You‚Äôre probably accustomed to thinking of bets as either value or bluff. In this taxonomy, value bets are hands whose value comes from getting called, and bluffs are those whose value comes from getting folds. There are also semi-bluffs, hands that bet to make better hands fold but also have a substantial chance of improving to a winning hand. And there are thin value or protection bets, modest made hands that do reasonably well when called and also benefit from causing live equity to fold.
While this terminology can be useful, these categories are ultimately human inventions designed to help our puny brains simplify the true spectrum of value. It is more accurate to say bets derive their value from some combination of the following sources:
Growing the pot ‚Äì Value derived from winning the pot if the bet is called (or raised). The most important measure of this value is how much equity a hand has against the opponent‚Äôs calling range, but as we will see, there are other considerations.
Denying value ‚Äì Value derived from causing other players to fold. The most important measure here is how much equity the bet causes to fold, but again, this is not the only consideration.
All bets derive their value from some combination of growing a pot they are likely to win and denying value to opponents.

Simple Examples
Let‚Äôs take a look at a simple cash game scenario. This is a single raised pot, BTN vs BB, 100BB deep:
After BB checks their entire range, the BTN mostly chooses between a large bet or a check. For our purposes, we‚Äôll look exclusively at the 125% pot bet, which is the most commonly used option. As is usually the case with a large bet size, the BTN employs a fairly polar betting range, preferring to bet mostly very strong and very weak hands and check many medium-strength hands.
The chart below shows a few example hands from BTN‚Äôs range along with how often they bet and what value they derive from the 125% pot bet:
AK is a straightforward value bet; almost all its value comes from calls. It gains only 6% of the pot in equity when BB folds, but with 84% equity against BB‚Äôs calling range, it earns a very nice return on every dollar that goes into the pot.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, 9‚ô£6‚ô£ is a virtually pure bluff. It does terribly when called, retaining only 8% equity, but it can cause the Villain to fold 74% equity.
In between the two are some semi-bluffs like 9‚ô•6‚ô•, which derive their equity from both sources. 9h 6h has 36% equity against BB‚Äôs calling range, so it‚Äôs not as pure a bluff as 9‚ô£6‚ô£, but it still folds hands that have, on average, 46% equity against it.
Pocket 22s lies somewhere between a semi-bluff and a pure bluff: it gains more from folds than the flush draw but has better equity when called than the pure bluff.
The nut flush draw, on the other hand, is much closer to a pure value bet, though it‚Äôs thinner than AK. A‚ô•4‚ô• gains very little from folds, but, between the chance of already having the best hand and the chance of improving to a flush or even two pair, it has a respectable 73% equity when called.
BTN doesn‚Äôt bet QQ at all because it cannot derive significant value from either calls or folds. Hands that fold don‚Äôt have much chance of drawing out anyway, and hands that call are mostly better pairs which QQ does poorly against. Some players are reluctant to check QQ in spots like this for fear of getting bluffed, which is a reasonable concern. However, it‚Äôs essential to understand that the reason to check QQ is not so much that checking is an appealing option as it is that betting is even less appealing. This is simply a lousy flop for QQ, and checking is the least bad option.

A Complicated Example
Not all BTN‚Äôs bets map so intuitively onto this spectrum. Q‚ô•9‚ô† is a high-frequency bluff, for example, despite having only 12% equity when called. It gains far less from folds (only 52% equity) compared to other bluffs like 9‚ô£ 6‚ô£. So what makes it such an appealing bluff?
Here‚Äôs a hint: not all combinations of Q9 are candidates for betting. BTN only bets with a heart, and even then, they bet Q‚ô•9x more frequently than Qx9‚ô•. Some of this is a blocking effect‚ÄìBB never folds Q‚ô•X‚ô•, so knowing the Q‚ô• is not in her hand increases the likelihood she will fold ‚Äì but that‚Äôs not all there is to it. Note that the EV of betting Q‚ô•9‚ô† is much higher than the EV of betting Q‚ô£9‚ô¶, even though they have similar equity when called.
To understand why we must understand the benefits of growing the pot. The BTN benefits from making the pot larger if they are likely to win it. Equity is a rough approximation of what it means to be likely to win, but it only considers wins that result from the hand going to showdown. The other way for the BTN to win is by successfully bluffing on a subsequent street.
Showdown equity is only a rough approximation of how likely you are to win the pot.
Take a look at BTN‚Äôs barreling strategy with Q‚ô•9‚ô† across all possible turns:
Note that betting again is appealing if BTN turns a draw. Of course, this reflects potentially improving to a straight or flush, but even on many blank rivers, this hand can continue to bluff. Once three hearts are on the board, the Q‚ô• is a powerful blocker. Anticipating this possibility, BTN can start bluffing with it as early as the flop, even though it has poor equity when called. Getting called is not as bad as it seems because this hand will not have to rely on its equity at showdown on many runouts. It will be a strong candidate for bluffing at a large pot, and that EV is built into the flop bet.
Something similar is going on with AK and A‚ô•4‚ô•: these hands benefit from growing the pot not only because they have good equity when called but because they anticipate value betting many turns and rivers as well. This is why they have EVs greater than their pot equity.
BTN has less incentive to bet immediately with weaker Aces. A hand like A8o will value bet eventually, but growing the pot immediately is not crucial because they‚Äôre unlikely to bet all three streets. Furthermore, they may make more from bluff-catching turns or rivers. They can pot control on the flop without missing value later on.

Conclusion
Poker is complicated. Fold equity and showdown equity are appealing metrics because they are simple and precisely calculable, but this is also their limitation. The actual value of betting on early streets depends not only on how it changes the immediate equities but on the opportunities it creates for later street play.
Flopping well or holding a likely best hand does not oblige you to bet. Nor does holding a very weak hand on a flop that favors your range. You will want to bet these hands eventually, but it does not have to happen on the flop.
The heuristic to take away here is that when you can anticipate continuing to bet, whether for value or as a bluff, on later streets, you have additional incentive to bet the current street. If you are not likely to bet multiple streets, there is more reason to start with a check.
When you can anticipate continuing to bet, whether for value or as a bluff, on later streets, you have additional incentive to bet the current street.
### TOPIC: visualizing implied odds
Visualizing implied odds
Implied odds are a key metric when it comes to poker theory. You may have heard the term, and developed a baseline understanding of the idea, however, the concept has evolved a lot in the solver era.
What are implied odds?
Implied odds are the value you expect to gain over and above your raw equity. You can think of it as the value you expect to gain on future streets when you outdraw your opponent. This concept is used in contrast to ‚Äúdirect pot odds‚Äù as a way to explain why some hands can profitably draw despite not having enough raw equity to call.
Direct vs implied odds
Here‚Äôs an example. We‚Äôre facing a 10BB pot-sized bet on the turn. We hold a draw with 25% equity. Should we call?
Direct pot odds calculation
Direct pot odds refer to the percentage of the time you need to win in order to at least break even on a call. This assumes no money goes in later.
25% of the time we hit our draw and win 20BB (the pot + opponent‚Äôs bet)
75% of the time we miss and lose 10BB (our call)
Expected value of calling = (25% x 20BB) ‚Äì (75% x 10BB) = 5 ‚Äì 7.5 = -2.5BB
Clearly, this is a losing call. The problem with this calculation, however, is that it ignores money that goes into the pot later ‚Äì that‚Äôs where implied odds come in!
Implied odds calculation
In order to justify this call, we need to win some extra money (M) on the river. We can always fold if we miss.
25% of the time we hit our draw and win 20BB + M (the pot + opponent‚Äôs bet + M)
75% of the time we miss and lose 10BB (our call)
Expected value of calling = (25% x (20+M)) ‚Äì (75% x 10)
How much extra do we need to win when we hit that draw in order to break even? Set EV to zero to find the breakeven point, then solve for M:
0 = (25% x (20+M)) ‚Äì (75% x 10)
M = 10
We need to win 10BB more on the river, on average, to justify calling. That amounts to a mere ‚Öì pot bet on the river. So if we think we can extract at least a ‚Öì pot bet when we hit our draw, then this call becomes profitable!
In other words, a call ‚Äúimplies‚Äù that it would win (at least) an extra 10BB on the river. This is where the term gets its name.
How it relates to equity realization
SB opens, BB calls. Flop is J‚ô•T‚ô¶6‚ô•2‚ô£. SB bets 75%, BB calls. SB overbets turn 175% pot, action on BB with 5h3h.
Let‚Äôs start with a simple pot odds calculation. We (BB) are facing a 26.25BB bet, and the pot is 15BB. To break even on a call we need to win at least 26.25BB in the long run.
Imagine we‚Äôre holding a marginal combo draw like 5‚ô•3‚ô• which only has 31.68% equity.
Let‚Äôs look at our direct pot odds. Required equity = (amount to call) / (pot after you call ‚Äì rake). BB needs 26.25 / (15 + 26.25*2 ‚Äì 0.6) = 39.24% equity to call.
If the SB were shoving (or indeed if the river were always checked down), this would be an easy fold. However, there‚Äôs still 66.25BB behind after calling. 5h3h expects to win more than its fair share of equity when it hits the draw due to implied odds.
Our EV with 5h3h is 5.33BB higher than folding. What this actually means, is that we expect to win (26.25BB + 5.33BB = 31.58BB) after calling. After we call the bet the pot will be 67.5BB, so our expected pot share is (31.58 / 67.5) = 46.78% pot (ignoring rake).
Let‚Äôs recap:
Our raw equity is 31.68%
Our pot share is 46.78%
In other words, we are over-realizing our equity by: 46.78/31.68 = 148%
More accurately, our expected value is higher than our raw equity would imply, because of our ability to outdraw value later on. This is the fundamental nature of implied odds.
Reverse implied odds
Reverse implied odds also exist. For example, sometimes you‚Äôll hit your draw and lose a huge pot anyway. Sometimes a made hand won‚Äôt win its fair share of the pot due to being dominated or outdrawn on later streets. Making the second-best strong hand can severely cut into your profit margins.
Let‚Äôs go back to our original J‚ô•T‚ô¶6‚ô•2‚ô£ example and say we‚Äôre holding K‚ô†J‚ô†.
K‚ô†J‚ô† has good equity and is ahead of more than half of villain‚Äôs range. However, it‚Äôs barely above breakeven against their overbet. When your opponent is polarized, your marginal made hands struggle to outdraw villain‚Äôs value hands. These hands play closer to bluff-catchers and have poor reverse implied odds.
Again, we need to win 26.25BB to break even, and K‚ô†J‚ô† wins 26.25 + 2.21 = 28.46BB, or approximately 28.46/67.5 = 42% of the pot.
Raw equity: 54.71%
EV: 42.16%
Equity realization = 77%.
In other words, we only realize 77% of our raw equity.
So where did the rest of our EV go? Well SB has the ability to over-realize their equity and put our top pair in a lot of indifferent spots on the river. They can polarize over us with stronger value/bluffs, outdraw us and stack our top pair for a big profit. We won‚Äôt be able to call every river bet. We have a bluff-catcher, that can‚Äôt extract value from worse because their range is so strong.
Let‚Äôs visualize this. Here‚Äôs our equity distribution facing their overbet. The dots on the line represent all our KJs. As you can see, most of the BB‚Äôs range is indifferent, as can be seen by that long flat line of bluff-catchers.
How implied odds relate to stack depth
Stack depth is the single largest factor when it comes to evaluating implied odds. Remember that ‚Äúimplied‚Äù indicates that we expect to win additional chips on later streets. The more chips we have behind, the more potential to win (or lose) chips on later streets, and the higher the implied/reverse implied odds.
Let‚Äôs compare how the solver opens the HJ at different stack depths in a standard cash game:
HJ open: 50BB deep
You should also consider how likely your opponent is to put in chips on later streets. For example, your flush draws have lower implied odds if they shut down on all flush-completing runouts.
HJ open: 100BB deep
As we get deeper, we see a preference towards hands like lower pocket pairs, suited connectors, and generally hands with better implied odds. The effect is subtle, but it‚Äôs even more pronounced in tournament charts:
We can see the range expanding from high-equity shoves at low stack depth to more ‚Äúplayable‚Äù hands with better implied odds at a deeper stack depth. The range retracts at 60BB+ as other players can enter the pot with a wider range due to improved implied odds.
Visualizing implied odds through multiway equity retention
Implied odds are connected to a hand‚Äôs ability to draw to something nutted. We sometimes call this effect ‚Äúplayability‚Äù. The following gif is a color-coded equity distribution of 2-14 players with any two cards. Here we can see how equity evolves multiway. Pay attention to the gradient rather than the exact numbers.
To my surprise, I‚Äôve found that by tweaking the number of players (adjusting the value of implied odds) you can create equity gradients that roughly resemble GTO opening ranges. For example, here‚Äôs the equity gradient for the top 44% of hands next to a standard 100BB BTN opening range.
Try this spreadsheet yourself!
Even though there are only 3 players left in the hand, the value of implied odds gets exaggerated 100BB deep. In order to replicate the GTO EV gradient, I‚Äôve artificially increased the implied odds by increasing the multiway equity calculations to 8 players.
As we add more players, the equity gradient shifts towards more suited and connected hands that have a better chance of drawing to something nutted.
In this way, we are treating implied odds as an adjustable parameter to artificially highlight the intrinsic implied odds of different kinds of hands (or more accurately, the inherent ability of a hand to draw to something strong).
Even though there are only 3 players left in the hand, the value of implied odds gets exaggerated 100BB deep. In order to replicate the GTO EV gradient, I‚Äôve artificially increased the implied odds by increasing the multiway equity calculations to 8 players. This kind of analysis underestimates blocker effects which makes it harder to replicate early position opening ranges. Regardless, I hope you‚Äôve enjoyed this visual representation of implied odds as much as I enjoyed creating it!

### TOPIC: when is bluffing profitable
When Is Bluffing Profitable? The Key Factors You Need to Know
When is bluffing profitable? When you expect your opponent to fold!
That‚Äôs not a joke, and I don‚Äôt say that only because it isn‚Äôt funny. When playing against weaker players, you may be able to anticipate that they will fold, or at least that they are likely to defend at lower than the optimal frequency necessary to make your bluffs unprofitable. Bluffing is not generally very profitable, so exploiting opponents who over-fold really is where much of your profit from bluffing will come from. That is not the subject of this article, however.

What Is a Bluff?
Defining a bluff is trickier than you might think. Broadly, it could mean any bet where you are rooting for your opponent to fold, or at least rooting for them to fold hands better than yours. For our purposes, I want to be a bit more specific:
A bluff is a bet that derives most or all of its value from fold equity.
That means little to none of the bet‚Äôs value derives from pots won at showdown, whether that be winning unimproved or improving to something that can win at showdown.
On the river, it‚Äôs easy to meet this definition. You can‚Äôt improve your hand if your bluff doesn‚Äôt work, nor should you expect your opponent to call with a hand even weaker than your own in hopes of improving it.
Before the river, however, pure bluffs are rare. Most hands have some chance of improving, even if it‚Äôs just a backdoor draw or a miracle two-outer.
When I talk about bluffing before the river, I mean betting the worst hands in your range, even if they are not completely hopeless.
Bluffing in the AKQ Game
Perhaps you‚Äôve heard of the ‚ÄúAKQ Game‚Äù (sometimes called the ‚ÄúClairvoyance Game‚Äù). In this toy game, both players are dealt a single card from a deck containing one Ace, one King, andƒç one Queen. They ante and are allowed to bet as they could in a real poker game. If the hand goes to showdown, the player with the highest card wins.
Suppose you were dealt a Queen in this game. Your opponent checks, and you are last to act. Should you bet?
Reveal Answer
Real poker is more complicated. There are many cases where betting your worst hands should show a profit, and there are also many cases where you should expect it to be downright unprofitable, so it is not something you do at any frequency.
Whether or not betting your worst hands should show a profit is mostly determined by what happened on earlier streets.
A River Example
BTN opens 2.5bb in a 100bb cash game and BB calls. On a flop of A‚ô†T‚ô¶3‚ô¶, BB checks and calls a 125% pot continuation bet. The 3‚ô† checks through, and the river brings the Q‚ô•.
This is the Manhattan plot for BB‚Äôs equilibrium river strategy with their entire range, weakest hands on the left and strongest hands on the right. I‚Äôve removed the bet sizes, so the chart simply shows how often BB bets each part of their range, without regard to size:
BB river-probe strategy vs BTN on A‚ô†T‚ô¶3‚ô¶ 3‚ô† Q‚ô• (with flop = X-B125-C)
The pure pink on the far left side of the graph means BB always bets their worst hands, stuff like 5‚ô†2‚ô†, which whiffed on the gutshot and backdoor flush draw. These bets must, therefore, be profitable. If BB were indifferent to bluffing, as they are in the Clairvoyance Game, we would expect to see a mix of bets and checks. Here‚Äôs the same plot in the Clairvoyance Game:
BB river strategy vs BTN on 33322: Clairvoyance Game
Because BB only bets two hands in the Clairvoyance Game, this graph is easy to interpret. They always bet Aces, and they are indifferent to betting Queens.
That‚Äôs not what we see in our river example.
So the question is, why is it profitable for BB to bet their worst hands in this equilibrium? Why doesn‚Äôt BTN call more often in order to make BB indifferent to bluffing?
Choose the explanation you think is correct from the four options below, then read on for the answer.
BB has a reputation for being a nit, so BTN is trying to exploit them by not paying off their river-bets.
BTN does not have enough potential bluff-catchers to hit MDF, which would make BB indifferent to bluffing.
BB does not have enough potential bluffs to achieve the bluffing frequency that would incentivize BTN to bluff-catch more than they already are.
BB‚Äôs bluffs are carefully chosen for their blocker effects. When BB has these cards, they block BTN from having as many bluff-catchers as they otherwise would.

Where Range Advantage Comes From
BB gets profitable bluffs in this scenario because their range is much stronger than BTN‚Äôs. They have more than 70% of the equity, a dynamic illustrated dramatically by this range-vs-range equity graph:
River equity distributions
So much of BTN‚Äôs range is behind so much of BB‚Äôs range that if they called more often, in the hope of picking off bluffs from those very worst hands, BB could exploit them with thinner value-bets.
But that still doesn‚Äôt get to the why. Why is BB‚Äôs range so much stronger? Why isn‚Äôt either player incentivized to do something differently on an earlier street to even out this dynamic?
BB‚Äôs Perspective
Perhaps you noticed that I pulled a fast one a few paragraphs back when I said, ‚ÄúIt seems like calling 5‚ô†2‚ô† [on the flop] is a win-win: either you improve to something strong, or you bluff and show a (small) profit.‚Äù In fact, there is a third thing that could happen‚Äîan event which quite frequently will happen, in fact‚Äîthat is not so good for 5‚ô†2‚ô† and which is the reason it is not a pure call on the flop: BTN might bet again on the turn, charging BB a high price to realize their equity on the river and denying them the opportunity to bluff.
The reason this dynamic can exist at equilibrium is that BB does not know, at the time they call the flop, that BTN is going to check behind the turn. If they knew that in advance, then they would call many more weak hands on the flop. But if they were to call more weak hands, then BTN could exploit them by barreling more often.
BB took a big risk with those weak calls, and they got lucky that BTN didn‚Äôt have a good barreling hand.
These profitable river bluffs are their reward for taking a risk that panned out.
BTN‚Äôs Perspective
BTN, on the other hand, took a risk that did not pay off. They bet the flop, and their opponent did not fold. Of course, not all of BTN‚Äôs range wants to see a fold, but much of it‚Äîespecially much of the range that isn‚Äôt going to bet again on the turn‚Äîwould very much prefer to see BB fold the flop.
BTN‚Äôs flop-bet was not nearly as risky as BB‚Äôs flop-call. They put the same amount of money into the pot, of course, but BTN had two big advantages going for them:
They had fold equity. When BTN bets weak hands, they might just win the pot immediately, whereas BB can‚Äôt win the pot immediately when they call. BB will sometimes get fold equity on the river after the turn checks through, and that does offset the risk of the flop-call, but they can‚Äôt count on that happening consistently.
Even in case their opponent did not fold, they were in position, giving them better control of the pot. They will be able to check behind the turn when they want to, facilitating free cards and cheaper showdowns.
Range advantage emerges when players take on disproportionate risk at an earlier decision point.
So, when a player fades their worst-case outcomes, they typically have an equity advantage and get to make profitable (as opposed to break-even) bluffs with their weakest hands.
The reverse is also true:
A player who takes on less risk on early streets is typically at an equity disadvantage on later streets and does not bet their worst hands at all.
For example, here is BTN‚Äôs strategy for the same scenario, facing a BB river check:
BTN river strategy vs BTN check on A‚ô†T‚ô¶3‚ô¶ 3‚ô† Q‚ô• (with flop = X-B125-C, turn = X-X)
With their very worst hand, 6‚ô†5‚ô†, they never bluff. Many other hands with 0% equity are also pure checks, suggesting they would be -EV bluffs. There are no pure bluffs, and the weak hands that mix bluffs are facilitated by blockers, not by an equity advantage.
A Flop Example
If we back up to the flop in our example, the roles are reversed. BTN took on more risk preflop, so they are the player who sees the flop with a stronger range (55% equity) and the player who can profitably bet their worst hands. 65 without a backdoor flush draw is the stone bottom of BTN‚Äôs range, yet even this hand has an EV of greater than 1bb (roughly 20% of the pot) and is a candidate for betting:
BB has no donk-bets on this flop, and were they to face even a small c-bet, they would purely fold many of their worst hands:
BB flop strategy vs BTN‚Äôs 33% pot bet on AT3tt
Because of their range disadvantage (and, to a lesser extent, their positional disadvantage), they cannot profitably bluff with the bottom of their range as BTN can. It‚Äôs not even a mix for them, as it would be in the Clairvoyance Game. Bluffing with their worst hands would lose money, on average.
But let‚Äôs get back to BTN‚Äôs strategy. In the Clairvoyance Game, a mix of bets and checks meant that bluffing was not profitable. In our river example, BB purely bet their worst hands because it was profitable. But in this flop example, BTN sometimes declines profitable bluffs.
If you‚Äôre holding 6-high, no draw, and someone told you that you could claim 20% of the pot with a bluff, that would sound awfully appealing. Why would BTN ever decline to bluff and check such a weak hand instead?

The Bluffing Voucher
The way I think about this is that when a player fades a risk and arrives at a lucky branch of the game tree, they receive a voucher that can be redeemed for one profitable bluff. That is their reward for the risk they took. Unless some new bit of bad luck comes along, they can cash in that voucher at any time. But they only get to use it once.
BB had to redeem their voucher in our river example because that was their last (reliable) opportunity to do so. They can‚Äôt count on check/raising the river, because that would require their opponent‚Äôs cooperation, and they should not expect BTN to bet many of the hands they would like to fold out with a bluff.
A Turn Example
If both players check the A‚ô†T‚ô¶3‚ô¶ flop, BB would still be at an equity disadvantage. So, it would still be unprofitable for them to bluff their worst hands (unless they had especially good blockers):
BB turn-probe strategy vs BTN on A‚ô†T‚ô¶3‚ô¶ 3‚ô†
BTN, however, has not yet redeemed their voucher, so they once again have the option to bluff profitably with their worst hands. It is not their last opportunity, however, so they can just as profitably check and save that voucher for the river.
A Different River Example
If both players check again on the turn, BB finally gets some break-even and/or profitable (with the help of blockers) bluffs on the river.
BB river strategy vs BTN (with flop and turn = X-X)
The operating principle here is similar to our original river example, though the effect is less dramatic. BTN checking behind both the flop and turn was a stroke of good fortune for BB. BB would have called with more weak hands preflop if they knew they would get to see five cards for no additional investment, but of course, they did not know that. They went down a lucky branch of the game tree, and their reward was an upgrade from -EV to 0EV bluffs with the bottom of their range.
As for BTN, this is their last opportunity to redeem that voucher, so if BB checks, all their worst hands are pure bluffs:
BTN double-delayed c-bet river strategy vs BB check

Voiding the Voucher
What if BB does not check the river? If BB bets, BTN‚Äôs voucher is null and void. They mix some bluffs with their worst hands, but none of them are profitable (if they were, BTN would never fold them).
BTN river strategy vs BB‚Äôs 36% pot bet
The bluffing voucher is a lucky reward for fading risk and ending up on a favorable branch of the game tree. If BB bets either the turn or river, that is an unlucky occurrence for the BTN. It is not necessarily a strong hand, but it represents more strength than a check would have, which is why BTN loses their voucher.
They could also lose their voucher in an especially unfortunate event (i.e., flop, turn, or river). That is more rare, however. By definition, a range that is favored before new card(s) are dealt will generally remain favored after the card(s) are dealt. A player‚Äôs previous-street equity, in other words, is the average of their equity on all possible runouts. So, it is only the most exceptionally bad turn cards that will disrupt their advantage.
Why Doesn‚Äôt BB Beat BTN to the Punch?
We‚Äôve seen several examples where BTN gets profitable bluffs if BB checks but not if BB bets. If it‚Äôs that easy to void BTN‚Äôs bluffing voucher, why doesn‚Äôt BB do it more often? Why not take the initiative and bluff first, pushing BTN off the weak hands, which will eventually bluff out BB‚Äôs weak hands if given the opportunity?
They could, and sometimes they do, but it‚Äôs risky. When a player with a range advantage checks, there‚Äôs still a lot of strength in that checking range. Unless the new card is especially unlucky for BTN, it shouldn‚Äôt be profitable for BB to bet any two cards. Yes, BB could sometimes steal the pot from a weak hand that would have stolen it from them if they‚Äôd checked, but more often, they would get called or raised.
This risk is what makes BB‚Äôs bets strong, alarming, unlucky actions that disrupt BTN‚Äôs range advantage.
When a player fades risk whilst having prepared for it, they are supposed to get a reward. That‚Äôs what maintains the equilibrium.
When you are in the BTN‚Äôs shoes, it may feel bad to check the flop with a weak hand that could have profitably bluffed just to end up folding it to a turn-bet. It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that that turn-bet was far from a guarantee.
In fact, another way of looking at this outcome is that you saved money by not bluffing into a hand that wasn‚Äôt going to fold.
This is how BTN ends up indifferent between bluffing the flop versus checking the flop in hopes of bluffing later. There are risks to passing up the immediately profitable bluff: they might get an unlucky turn or induce BB to bluff with a hand that would have folded. But there are also rewards: they might get a lucky turn or find out cheaply that their bluff was never going to succeed.

Conclusion
A player acquires range advantage by taking on more risk than their opponent and then fading the worst outcomes (both unlucky board cards and unlucky opponent actions). They retain that range advantage until one of three things happens:
They cash it in by betting. Betting with range advantage claims a lot of EV from the branch of the game tree where your opponent folds. If they don‚Äôt fold, that is an unlucky outcome that strengthens their range (because calling and raising are risky), and you will generally be at a disadvantage going forward.
An especially unlucky board card(s) disrupts their advantage.
Their opponent takes a strong action that disrupts their advantage.
While a player has the range advantage, they essentially have a voucher that entitles them to a single profitable (+EV) bluff with even their worst hands. They can use that immediately to bluff or check and (usually) carry their range advantage forward to the next street and bluff then.
For the player without a range advantage, it is usually -EV to bet their worst hands. These players may still bet hands that prefer to get folds, but these will either have especially good blockers or be closer to semi-bluffs, hands with a decent chance of winning when called.
Only when neither player has much of an advantage, as in the Clairvoyant Game, is betting the bottom of the range 0EV for both players.
### TOPIC: Combating Your Opponents
I want to make it perfectly clear that you make money primarily by taking advantage of your
opponents‚Äô mistakes. Your own great plays certainly matter, but taking advantage of your
opponents is where most of your profit comes from. That is why you can achieve such a huge
win rate in small stakes cash games compared to other forms of poker. If your opponents all
played well, you could not expect to make much money. If you ever hear someone say ‚ÄúI would
win if my opponents would stop making bad plays,‚Äù they are clearly unaware of this most basic
concept.
Most poker books start by laying out a default strategy. A much better way to approach poker,
assuming you already know the basics, is to figure out what your opponents are doing
incorrectly so you can develop a strategy that takes advantage of their errors. In high stakes
games you should strive to play in a fundamentally sound manner that is unexploitable, electing
to slowly grind out a small edge. An unexploitable strategy aims to play in a game theory
optimal manner such that no matter what your opponent does, he cannot profit versus you.
This strategy will lead to you breaking even against other excellent players and winning a small
amount from amateur players.
In small stakes games, where your opponents constantly make blunders, you should look to get
well out of line in order to exploit them. An exploitable strategy is one that is tailored to take
advantage of your opponents‚Äô mistakes. Since the players in the small stakes games will make
plenty of mistakes, you should play in an exploitable manner.
No two players are exactly the same, but you will find that you will be better able to formulate
your plan of attack if you classify your opponents in some way. While you can classify them
based on a wide range of metrics, it is usually best to figure out where your opponents fall on
the loose/passive and the tight/aggressive spectrums. From there, you can quantify specific
tendencies each opponent exhibits that you can exploit. To help you get started classifying your
opponents, I will outline the six basic types of opponents you will encounter and also list
adjustments you can make to your default strategy in order to take advantage of them. Rest
assured, I will cover my default bet sizing and general strategies in the Preflop and Postflop
sections.

### TOPIC: Straightforward Loose Passive Players
You are likely to find that most of your opponents in small stakes cash games play in a
straightforward, loose, passive manner. These players have usually been playing poker for a
long time but have not grasped the concept that they do not need the best hand to win the pot.
They also do not understand that if a lot of money goes into the pot when they have top pair,
they will usually be crushed by a premium made hand.
Their general strategy is to limp, or call a raise, hoping to see a flop with a wide range of hands
they think have potential, including 4-4, A-J, A-4, K-9, 9-8, K-5s, Q-7s, and 5-3s. After the flop,
when they make top pair or better, they tend to apply immense pressure because they are
afraid of getting outdrawn. With a made hand worse than top pair, they will usually check with
the intention of calling down to the river, where they will typically fold to one last bet if they fail
to improve to a hand that beats top pair. They tend to also play their drawing hands in a passive
manner, calling down to see if they improve to a premium hand. If they are fortunate enough to
complete their draw, they usually bet or raise big, hoping you will pay them off. When they
miss their draw, they usually fold. You will find that most of these players rarely bluff because
they think the only winning poker strategy is to make strong hands and then pile in their
money.For simplicity, all hand examples in this book will be from $1/$2 with $200 effective stacks
unless otherwise stated. The effective stack is the shortest stack involved in the pot. Suppose
three of these loose, passive players limp for $2, one from the lojack (the seat three to the right
of the button), one from the hijack (the seat two to the right of the button), and one from the
cutoff (the seat directly to the right of the button). You decide to call $2 on the button with 8-7.
Both blinds see the flop as well. It comes 8-6-3. If someone bets and someone else calls, you
should usually fold, assuming that you are against some combination of (a) made hands that
beat yours, (b) worse made hands that will win 25% of the time against yours, and (c) draws
that will win about 35% of the time against yours. While you could have the best hand, unless
you think your opponents will play in an overly weak manner if you raise, you should get out of
the way. Some players elect to call a bet to try to improve to trips or two pair, but you will often
find that when you improve, you will not get paid off or that you still have the second-best
hand. If only one player bets on the flop and everyone in between folds, you should tend to call,
opting to see what develops on the turn. If everyone checks to you, you should certainly bet
both for value (because worse made hands and draws will call) and protection (because you do
not want to give a free card to various overcards, such as A-T and Q-J). It is important to realize
that you should have a logical reason for every bet you make. If you routinely make bets
without having a logical reason, you are certainly making errors.
Straightforward, loose, passive players are easy to beat because they usually play in a blatantly
straightforward manner. They raise when they love their hand, call when they are unsure, and
fold when they know they are crushed.
You will find that a decent chunk of your profit comes from folding when it is clear these
opponents have premium hands. If you know your opponent really likes his hand and you have
a marginal made hand, such as top pair with a weak kicker or middle pair, you should get out of
the way, assuming you are not getting the proper price to draw to a better hand. Do not be
stubborn and stick around until the river, hoping to luckily improve.
You will also crush these players by value betting in such a way that they can realistically call
when you have the best hand. For example, assume you raise to $6 with A-Q and three players
call. If the flop comes A-7-5, you should bet about half the size of the pot on all three streets.
You will find that most opponents will happily call you down with any Ace, which you crush,
whereas if you check, they may or may not value bet, fearing they could be beat. By betting on
all three streets, you extract a huge amount of value from your opponents‚Äô good, but
second-best, made hands. However, if you instead bet the size of the pot or more on all three
streets, unless your opponents are incapable of folding marginal made hands, they will usually
make snug folds. You rarely want to make a bet that forces your opponents to play perfectly, as
a large bet does in this situation.
You may be wondering why I used the preflop raise size of $6, as it is much smaller than most
people‚Äôs raises are in a typical $1/$2 game. The logic for this bet sizing will be addressed in the
Preflop section. I will also discuss how to deal with players who choose much larger bet sizes. In
general though, before the flop you typically want to raise to a touch less than the size of the
pot. You can figure out the size of the pot by multiplying the last bet by three then adding in
any additional money that is in the pot. In this situation, when you are the first to put money in
the pot, three times the last bet (the big blind) is $6 plus any dead money (the small blind),
equals $7. So, a bit less than $7 is $6. This same formula applies when the pot gets large.
Suppose there are two limpers for $2 each, someone raises to $10, and someone else reraises
to $26. If you want to reraise to a bit less than the size of the pot, you should make it a bit less
than 3 x 26 + 10 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = $95, so perhaps $88. Once you memorize this simple formula,
you will never again be confused about how much to raise before the flop. Of course, there are
times when you should drastically adjust your bet sizes based on your opponent. These
situations will be discussed in the Preflop section.
Always think about the range of hands you are trying to get value from and adjust your bet size
accordingly. There are times to make big value bets and other times to value bet tiny. If you
have the nuts and think your opponent has either the second nuts or nothing, you should bet
huge, perhaps way more than the size of the pot, because very few people are capable of
folding the second nuts and they will fold to any bet when they have nothing. If you have
middle pair and think your opponent has bottom pair or Ace high, you should bet tiny, perhaps
25% of the size of the pot or less, because few people will call large bets with trashy made
hands.
While betting for value will allow you to crush your opponent when you have a better made
hand, you must be disciplined enough to make a big fold when it becomes clear that your
opponent has improved to a superior hand. For example, if you bet the flop, turn and river with
A-K on A-7-5-J-2 and your opponent called on the flop and turn, and then raised on the river, it
would be a total disaster to call your opponent‚Äôs raise. Betting for value with the intention of
folding if your opponent raises is a skill that simply must be mastered if you want to succeed
against loose, passive, straightforward players. Remember, these players call when they have
marginal hands (that your A-K beats) and raise when they have premium hands (which probably
beat your A-K). This means you can profitably bet for value while still being able to fold if you
get raised. Most small stakes cash game players are not capable of making a ‚Äúbig‚Äù fold in this
spot, which is one of the main reasons they never move up in stakes. It is nearly impossible to
build a bankroll if you always pay off your opponents when they outdraw you.
Another way you beat these opponents is by allowing them to overvalue their good, but not
premium, made hands. Suppose three of these players limp from middle positions and you
raise to $14 with A-A from the big blind. All the limpers call. The flop comes J-T-5. You bet $26
and one of your opponents raises to $60. At this point, both calling and going all-in are fine
options, depending on what you think about your opponent‚Äôs raising range. It is up to you to
figure out which play your opponent will view as the weakest, resulting in him paying you off
with the vast majority of his range. Of course, he could have you beat, but you will find that
most of the time you are against a marginal top pair such as K-J or Q-J.
Before we progress further, it is important to realize that you are always playing against a range
of hands, not one specific hand. If you ever hear someone at the table say ‚ÄúI put him on A-J so I
went all-in‚Äù, that player probably makes the mistake of putting his opponent on one specific
hand. That is simply not how poker works in the real world. In the previous example, when
your opponent raises the flop, his range could be quite tight, perhaps only A-J, K-J and Q-J, or it
could be much wider, including all sets, two pairs, overpairs, top pairs, strong middle pairs, and
draws. Of course, your opponent will only have one specific hand this exact time, but if you ran
this situation a million times, you would find that your opponent does not have that one
specific hand every single time. For this reason, you have to play your hand against your
opponent‚Äôs range. If you happen to be against the wide range of all sets, decent made hands,
and draws, your A-A will win roughly 67% of the time. While you will occasionally be against a
set or two pair that has you crushed, on average you will be in great shape. In turn, if you find
that your specific opponent has exactly a set or two pair almost every single time he raises, you
should fold your A-A because it only has 19% equity.
This illustrates why it is so important to understand how each of your opponents thinks. If you
get your stack in with 67% equity every time, you will crush the games, but if you instead get it
in with 19% equity every time, you will quickly go broke. It is up to you to figure out how much
equity you have in each situation and respond accordingly. In every hand you play for the rest
of your life, you should focus diligently on putting each player on a range and narrowing it as
play progresses.
One other way you can crush straightforward, loose, passive opponents is by picking up the pot
when it is clear they are not interested. Suppose one of these players limps from the lojack and
you raise to $10 from the button with K -5 (a risky, but probably correct play, depending on
what you think about the limper‚Äôs limping range). Only the limper calls. The flop comes
A -6 -2 . Your opponent checks. This is an excellent spot to bet $10 into the $23 pot. If your
opponent doesn‚Äôt have top pair or better, he will usually fold, giving you the pot. Seeing how
your opponent will only connect with the flop roughly 33% of the time (meaning he will have
nothing 67% of the time), and you only need to win the pot 30% of the time based on your bet
size, you will steal the pot way more than is required to show a profit. To figure out how often a
total bluff needs to work, you divide your bet ($10) by the pot you are trying to steal plus your
bet ($23 +$10) giving you 10/33 = 30%. If you know roughly how often your opponent will call a
bet based on his range, you can tailor your bluff size to ensure your bluffs are profitable. Keep
in mind that as your bet size decreases, your opponent is likely to call with a wider range.
You can also attack multiway pots if it is clear no one is interested. If two people limp, you limp
from late position, and the blinds come along, if the flop comes K-8-3 and everyone checks to
you, feel free to take a stab with a bet of about 50% of the size of the pot with any two cards.
When everyone checks to you, especially on the flop and turn when you are last to act, do not
be afraid to bet. While most players in these games tend to bet large, usually near the size of
the pot, you will find smaller bet sizes usually result in the same outcome. There is no point in
betting the size of the pot when you are bluffing if betting half of the size of the pot will induce
your opponents to fold roughly the same range of hands. By betting the minimum required to
get the job done when you are bluffing, you save money every time your bluffs fail. You must
realize that if your bluff needs to work 30% of the time but it will actually work 35% of the time,
you will show a profit, even though your bluff will fail 65% of the time. If your bluffs succeed
almost every time, you are not bluffing often enough.

### TOPIC: Weak Tight Passive Players
Weak, tight, passive players tend to act in an overly weak manner until it becomes clear to
them that they have a premium hand. They abhor the idea of putting their hard-earned money
at risk unless they are completely confident they will win the pot. In general, these players are
usually older, opting to play poker to pass the time, although that is not always the case.
These players tend to limp with most of the hands they deem to be playable. It is not
uncommon for them to limp with strong hands such as J-J and A-K from early position, call a
raise, and then check-call down with top pair, top kicker or an overpair, fearing they could be
beat by A-A. They see monsters in the closet because, to them, losing money is a traumatizing
experience that must be avoided at all cost.
Against these players, you should be overly cautious when they call your preflop raises, flop
bets, and turn bets. It is important to recognize that when they put money in the pot, even in a
passive manner, they can easily have a strong hand. For example, four players, some loose
passive and others tight passive, limp and you decide to raise to $18 from the small blind with
Q-2s (another risky, but probably correct play, which will be discussed later). Only the second
limper, with a $100 starting stack, calls. The flop comes A-J-4. You bet $18 and your opponent
calls. The turn is the (A-J-4)-6. You both check. The river is the (A-J-4-6)-9. You check, your
opponent goes all-in for $64 and you fold. He proudly shows his J-J as he scoops the pot. Once
your opponent called your preflop raise and flop bet, you can be confident he has a strong hand
he will never fold, allowing you to swiftly abandon your bluff.
An alternative version of this player type will only enter the pot by raising, usually to a huge
amount, perhaps to 7.5 big blinds ($15) because they want to be sure they win the pot
immediately or force their opponents to pay dearly to see the flop. They despise getting
outdrawn because they feel like they deserve to win with their strong hands. Feeling like you
deserve anything in poker (or life) will cause you to make mistakes. This significant error, which
they commit every single time they are dealt a premium hand, makes them the easiest player
type to play against. You should simply fold and wait for an overly premium hand that has their
strong range in bad shape. When someone raises huge before the flop, especially if they are
incapable of getting away from their entire range, which is perhaps 9-9+ and A-Q+, just wait
around for A-A, K-K, Q-Q, and A-K to crush them.
Since most of these players are not capable of folding a premium hand, if you happen to make a
hand that beats their premium range after the flop, it is usually best to bet it strong. If one of
these players raises to $10 from early position and three players call, you should call with all of
your pairs and suited connectors, regardless of your position. Suppose you call with 3-3 from
the big blind and the flop comes J-6-3. You check and the initial raiser bets $40. Everyone folds
around to you. While slow playing against most players would be ideal, since you know this
type of player only puts in significant money when he thinks he has a premium hand, you
should raise, perhaps to $90 or all-in. Your opponent will either call or go all-in with his entire
range, which will usually be exactly J-J+. Of course, you lose to J-J, but you beat everything else.
There is no point in slow playing if your opponent will happily jam his stack into the pot
immediately.
While the main way you crush these opponents is by staying out of their way unless you have
the effective nuts (a hand so strong that it might as well be the nuts, such as 3-3 on J-7-3 or J-7
on T-9-8), you will find that you can also slowly steal their stack by raising when they are in the
blinds. These players don‚Äôt like to invest money in a pot without a premium hand. Because of
this, they are quick to fold to preflop raises, even when getting decent pot odds in the blinds. If
everyone folds to you in middle or late position, do not be afraid to raise with a wide range of
reasonable hands, including 2-2, A-2, K-9, T-9, 6-5, and 9-5s. If only the weak, tight, passive big
blind defends, you should make a half pot continuation bet. If you have nothing and your
opponent calls your flop bet, it is usually wise to concede the pot. If you have a marginal made
hand, check the turn and try to get closer to the showdown. If you have the effective nuts,
continue betting in order to extract maximum value.

### TOPIC: Straightforward Tight Aggressive Players
Straightforward, tight, aggressive players tend to play in a similar manner as the weak, tight,
passive players, except they understand there is value in aggression. These players are
generally capable of raising with a slightly wider range preflop, including all pairs, Broadway
hands (hands containing two cards ten and higher), suited Aces, and suited connectors. They
frequently enter the pot with a raise, opting to rarely limp. They typically have a somewhat
solid tight, aggressive preflop strategy.
Despite their reasonably sound preflop play, most of these players play poorly after the flop.
They tend to overvalue any decently strong made hand. They realize they play very few hands,
so they feel they must win most of the pots they enter. This leads them to pay off their
opponents too often. For example, they raise with A-Q and four players call. The flop comes
Q-J-8. They continuation bet, get raised, then respond by going all-in. They are usually
disappointed to see that they are crushed by two pair or better. They do not accurately assess
their hand‚Äôs actual value in light of their opponent‚Äôs range. In order to take advantage of this
flaw, look for situations where your opponent is likely to have a strong hand, usually when he is
making a large bet into multiple opponents, and then try to invest as much money as possible
in a manner that ensures he stays in when you can beat his somewhat obvious top pair or
overpair.
These players usually know they should continuation bet with most of their range, especially in
heads-up pots. Once their continuation bet fails, they are lost as to what to do on the turn
when they do not have a premium holding. Especially heads-up, it is often a good idea to call
these players‚Äô continuation bets on boards that should be good for your range and bad for their
range. As an overgeneralization, flops good for the preflop raiser contain either an Ace or high
cards and flops good for the preflop caller contain middle and low cards. You can then apply
pressure on the turn either when the board gets overly scary or when your opponent checks to
you.
For example, a straightforward, tight, aggressive player raises to $7 from the lojack and you call
on the button with 4-4, A -T , K -Q , or 7 -6 (you should usually call with all of these
hands). Everyone else folds. The flop comes 9 -8 -6 . Your opponent bets $12. This is an
excellent spot to call to see what develops on the turn. If your opponent checks, on any turn
card that fails to improve your hand, you should bet $27 into the $41 pot, hoping to force your
opponent off almost his entire range. If you improve to a premium hand, you should probably
bet smaller, around $14, to induce him to stay in the pot. If your opponent continues betting on
the turn, it is a good idea to get out of the way, making the assumption that he usually has a
premium hand he will not fold to additional pressure. Unless you know this specific player likes
to fire multiple barrels with hands like A-K and K-Q, it is best to fold.
It is important to realize that by betting two different sizes based on your hand‚Äôs strength when
your opponent checks to you on the turn, you open yourself up to being exploited. In this
situation, if your opponent figures out you bet on the larger side when you are bluffing and on
the smaller side when you have a premium hand, he will be able to check-raise when you are
bluffing and check-fold when you have a premium hand. If your opponent plays perfectly
against you, expect to quickly lose all of your money. But in the time I spent at the $1/$2 tables,
I did not encounter anyone who played anywhere close to perfectly.
Fortunately, as long as your opponents are not keenly aware of your strategies and you don‚Äôt
play with them on a regular basis, playing in an exploitable manner is okay because they will
not adjust to take advantage of you. If they happen to become aware of what you are doing, it
is usually best to adjust to a more unexploitable (game theory optimal) strategy. In the previous
example, a less exploitable play would be to bet the same amount on the turn with your entire
range when your opponent checks to you. While you will likely get less value from your
premium hands (because you will usually be bluffing), you want to make the bet that maximizes
fold equity, which would be the $27 bet. Fold equity is simply the equity you gain when your
opponent folds a hand that has some potential. You typically rely on fold equity to make a
situation profitable when your hand is weak. If you don‚Äôt have fold equity (perhaps because
your opponent is a calling station, you have a wild image, or your opponent only plays strong
hands), playing a weak hand in an aggressive manner is a bad idea.
In general, as your opponent‚Äôs skill level goes up, you should play in a less exploitable manner.
You will find that almost everyone who plays the small stakes cash games is either oblivious to
what you are doing or will not have the courage to do anything about it. This allows you to play
in a blatantly exploitable manner almost all of the time with little fear of retaliation.
You should relentlessly attack straightforward, tight, aggressive players‚Äô blinds, especially from
middle and late position. This will usually result in them either folding preflop or calling preflop
and then check-folding to a flop continuation bet when they miss, both of which are excellent
results for you.
If your raise plus continuation bet is met by a raise or check-raise from one of these players, it is
almost always a good idea to fold unless you have a strong overpair or better. Most of these
players will only raise the flop with top pair or better, meaning you simply must have a strong
range to continue. Of course, some of these players will also check-raise draws, but realize
when you have J -J on T -9 -3 , if you bet and face a raise, if you think your opponent‚Äôs
range is sets, top two pair, overpairs, good top pair, and strong flush draws, your J-J only has
40% equity. So, you should fold. If you accurately comprehend how your hand fares against
your opponent‚Äôs raising range, you will be able to get off the hook with a minimal loss in spots
where other players lose their entire stacks.

### TOPIC: Good Tight Aggressive Players
Good, tight, aggressive players are similar to straightforward, tight, aggressive players except
they tend to understand relative hand values, both preflop and postflop. They will not make the
huge error of losing their entire stack every time they get A-A on 9-8-5 or A-K on K-J-7. Instead
they play intelligently, sometimes calling raises and other times folding, depending on their
perception of their opponent. These players will almost never mindlessly put their stack in the
pot simply because their hand is normally strong.
This player type also knows how to continue applying pressure in an intelligent manner.
Whereas straightforward, tight players will continuation bet with K-Q on 9-6-3 and then
check-fold on the turn unless they improve to top pair, good, tight, aggressive players will
continue betting when any overcard comes and perhaps even check when they improve to top
pair, hoping to induce you to bluff. When your opponent is capable of taking various actions
with their entire range, they become much more difficult to play against because you cannot
know with a high degree of certainty what any of their actions indicate.
Fortunately, you will rarely run into this type of player because they quickly move up to the
middle and high stakes games. If you play well and do not make the mistake of playing like
everyone else at your table, you will win money in the long run. If you play well enough to beat
$1/$2, you almost certainly play well enough to beat $2/$5.
These players, and all other forms of good players, are quite difficult to exploit. These are not
the players you are winning a huge amount of money from. Since you make money primarily
because of your opponents‚Äô errors, you should tend to avoid playing with good players who
make few errors unless you have a reasonably strong hand.
One of the easiest ways to exploit this type of player is to continually apply pressure. You
mainly accomplish this by reraising their preflop raises, raising their flop continuation bets,
raising their turn bets, or bluffing them on the river.
For example, if one of these players raises to $6 preflop from the hijack, feel free to reraise
from the cutoff or button with a reasonably wide range of hands, depending on how you expect
your opponent to react. If you think he is on the tighter side, only raising with premium hands
before the flop, do not reraise him as a bluff too often. If you know your opponent has a
premium hand, bluffing is a terrible idea. If you think he is a bit looser, raising with hands like
A-3 and Q-9 from the hijack, you should aggressively reraise him. You should typically reraise to
about $17. This will either result in him folding or calling preflop and then playing overly
straightforward on the flop, both of which are great results for you.
Your reraising range should consist of premium hands and hands that are not quite good
enough to call your opponent‚Äôs initial raise. This is referred to as a polarized range. As an
example, you could reraise with hands like J-J+ and A-Q+ for value plus some occasional bluffs
like A-5 ‚Äì A-2, K-8s ‚Äì K-5s, Q-8s, J-7s, a few other marginal suited hands, and perhaps unsuited
connectors like T-9, 9-8, and 8-7. You should notice that if you always reraise with all of these
hands, you would be bluffing way more than you are value betting, which is usually an error
versus a strong player. For this reason, you should not bluff every single time you have the
opportunity. Instead, either do it sporadically or when you have a physical read that the initial
raiser is opening with a weak hand.
You can attack these players on the flop by raising their flop continuation bets on boards that
should be good for you and bad for them. Great boards to liberally attack include T-9-7, 8-7-5,
J-7-7, and 8-8-6. If there is a flush draw on the flop, that provides an additional reason to apply
pressure. For example, if your opponent continuation bets $10 into the $13 pot, feel free to
raise to $26 with any marginal draw, such as a gutshot, or perhaps even complete air. Similarly
to your preflop bluffing range, you should notice that it is more common to have a bluff than a
premium hand on any board. For that reason, you should not bluff every time you have the
opportunity, unless your opponent assumes you only raise with premium hands.
It is important to understand that most good players will be somewhat aware of your general
playing style. If you are aggressively raising and reraising in every pot, do not expect good
players to assume your raises must indicate strength. If you have been overly tight for the last
hour, either because you have been card dead or you generally play a tight strategy, you should
expect your good opponents to fold when you apply pressure. Use this knowledge to your
advantage and do the opposite of what they expect you to do. If you find that your opponents
always fold to your aggression when you have a premium hand, you are most probably playing
too tight.
Against good, tight, aggressive players, you can call the flop with a wide range and then bet the
turn when it is checked to you. This is referred to as ‚Äúfloating‚Äù the flop. Additionally, you can
also raise if they bet the turn with a decently wide range. Most good players in small stakes
cash games assume their opponents will only raise the turn when they are willing to get their
stack in. This means that in order for them to continue against a turn raise, they think they
must have a premium hand. Since it is difficult to have a premium hand, they will usually
concede the pot.
Suppose a good, tight, aggressive player raises to $6 from middle position out of his $300 stack,
the Button (a tight, passive player calls) and you call with A -3 in the big blind. The flop
comes 8 -5 -2 . You check and the initial raiser bets $10. The Button folds. Both checkcalling and check-raising are fine options, depending on how you expect your opponent to
react. In general, most players fear turn check-raises more than flop check-raises, so you will
find that check-raising the turn gives you a bit more fold equity. However, your opponent may
not bet the turn, meaning you may not have the opportunity to check-raise. This time, you
decide to check-call. The turn is the (8 -5 -2 )-6 . You check and your opponent bets $23.
This is an excellent spot to check-raise to $57 or so. This will apply immense pressure and make
your opponent think you may be willing to put your entire stack in on the river.
It is important to realize that you can easily have a set or a straight whereas your opponent
almost certainly has either an overpair or unpaired overcards. This means your range should be
significantly stronger than your opponent‚Äôs, assuming you are not check-raising the turn too
often. Of course, he could have a set, but that is quite unlikely, and if he does, he may reraise
immediately on the turn, allowing you to abandon your bluff.
If you check-raise the turn and your opponent calls, you should occasionally consider bluffing
on any river besides an Ace or 4. If you are convinced your opponent has an overpair, he will
almost certainly not fold to a typical less than pot sized bet. Instead, you should make a giant
bet, electing to go all-in for $227 into the $153 pot. Of course, if your opponent is not capable
of folding an overpair, bluffing would be like lighting money on fire.
Remember the earlier discussion about how often a bluff needs to succeed in order for it to be
profitable. In this case, your bluff needs to work 227/(227+153) = 60% of the time to make you
money. While 60% may sound like a huge amount of the time, most good, tight, aggressive
players will not want to put their entire remaining 113 big blind stack in with only an overpair
when they could easily be facing the nuts. Notice by taking this aggressive line, you take almost
all of your opponent‚Äôs premium preflop hands and turn them into marginal bluff catchers. You
will find that most players will give you the pot because the vast majority of the $1/$2 player
pool only makes this play when they are a lock to win the pot. Of course, if you make this play
too often, your opponents will get suspicious and start looking you up. If that happens, you
should revert to a balanced game plan. Notice that if you can play your premium hands in this
manner and expect to get paid off because you have developed an overly aggressive image, you
will realize gigantic implied odds; meaning when you are fortunate enough to complete your
draws, you stand to win a huge amount of money.
In general, you will find that the first time you make a huge overbet as a bluff, it will succeed a
high percentage of the time. If you do it a second time, it becomes more likely that it will be
called. If you do it frequently, you will start getting looked up by any decently strong made
hand. You can use this to your advantage by bluffing with the overbet the first time, either
value betting or bluffing the second time, then primarily value betting for the remainder of the
session.
Another added benefit of applying immense pressure to your good, tight, aggressive opponents
is the fact that they will be inclined to stay out of your way, effectively turning them into
straightforward, tight, aggressive players who are easy to exploit. If you can play in a manner
that strikes fear in the hearts of your opponents, you will be able to have your way with the
table.

### TOPIC: Maniacal Loose Aggressive Players
Maniacs come in many different varieties. The main type of maniac blindly applies pressure
whenever you show any form of weakness. If you show significant strength, they will get out of
the way. Even maniacs realize that if you are willing to put your stack in against someone who
appears to be crazy, you must have a premium hand. For this reason, against maniacs, you
should tend to call with your decently strong hands in order to induce bluffs and occasionally
bluff in situations where you think the maniac will assume you must have a premium hand.
It is important to realize that hand values shift dramatically when playing against maniacs. This
is because the range of hands they start with is significantly wider than tighter players. For
example, if a maniac raises to $8 and you call on the button with Q -T , you should happily
look to call down on a J -T -5 -4 -7 board, assuming you know your opponent will
three-barrel with all of his bluffs when given the opportunity. While it is quite scary to put in a
large portion of your stack with only middle pair, if you do so in a passive manner, you will have
your opponent‚Äôs range crushed. If your opponent raises with 40% of hands preflop, which is
2-2+, A-2+, K-2s+, K-8+, Q-8s+, Q-9+, T-9, 9-8, 8-7, and all decent suited connectors, you have
71% equity if he three-barrels with that entire range. That is an extreme example, but clearly, if
your opponent is wild, calling down with middle pair is rarely an error, especially given you will
usually be getting 2:1 pot odds or better on each street.
Do not make the mistake of raising this type of maniac after the flop with your premium hands,
even on draw-heavy boards. If a maniac raises before the flop and you call with 9-9 (as you
frequently should unless you are confident you can get your entire stack in profitably before
the flop), if the flop comes J -9 -7 , it would be a huge error to raise your maniacal
opponent‚Äôs continuation bet. If you raise and he has nothing, he will easily fold. By calling, you
force him to stay in the pot with his entire range. While you will occasionally get outdrawn, it is
well worth the risk in order to induce him to continue bluffing. In fact, it is probably best to call
down until the river, only raising at that point if you improve to a full house or two small cards
come on the turn and river.
Be aware that you can successfully bluff these players from time to time. Suppose you call a
maniac‚Äôs raise, this time with Q -J , and get a K -9 -7 flop. When facing your opponent‚Äôs
continuation bet, you should often raise. Notice that if you get called, you have four fairly clean
outs to improve to a straight. You can also continue bluffing when a spade comes. A Queen or
Jack could give you the best hand. If you expect your opponent to give your flop raises too
much credit, do not be afraid to get well out of line.
There is another type of maniac who reraises before the flop with an overly wide range, hoping
to push you off almost your entire range. It is quite common in small stakes cash games for
someone to raise to $7 only to have a maniac reraise to $35. It is important to differentiate
between maniacs who reraise huge and tight, passive (or tight, aggressive) players who reraise
huge. Maniacs make this reraise frequently whereas tight players only do it with premium
hands. Against a maniacal player, you should accept that if you have a strong hand, you are
going to play a huge pot, usually for all your money. Both reraising the $35 reraise and calling
are great options with hands that typically have the maniac‚Äôs range crushed, such as 9-9 and
A-Q. While these hands would never be worthy of playing an all-in pot versus a tight player,
they are quite strong versus a maniac. If you think the maniac will fold to a $70 reraise or an
all-in push for $200, you should tend to call, forcing him to stay in the pot with his entire range.
If you think he will be willing to invest his entire stack with whatever junk he reraised with, feel
free to get your stack in with what is probably the best hand.
One other form of maniac you are likely to encounter is the type who blindly applies pressure at
all times, assuming he thinks you are reasonably active, whether or not you have shown
weakness. Against these players, it is important that you remain at least somewhat active
preflop and on the flop so they don‚Äôt mind giving you action. You will find that most maniacs
despise paying off overly tight players. Once they determine you are ‚Äúactive enough‚Äù, they will
gladly give you action. Feel free to raise and reraise with your premium hands when you are
happy to get your stack in. Against these players, A-9 on A-K-8, 8-7 on 8-5-2, and 7-7 on 6-3-2
are almost certainly strong enough to play for 100 big blind stacks.
You must bear in mind that maniacs will wake up with premium hands from time to time. Do
not let this discourage you from playing significant pots against them. If someone at your table
told you they would put their entire stack in the pot with 40% equity, you should happily hop in
every time, even though you will lose your stack 40% of the time. While you will certainly
encounter larger swings to your bankroll when playing against maniacs, as compared to tight
players, if you can remain emotionally stable, they will eventually deposit their stacks into your
bankroll.
You may notice that much of the advice in this section flies in the face of conventional small
stakes cash game wisdom that states you should bet and raise to protect your strong hands.
You must accept and understand that you make money by giving your opponents the
opportunity to make errors. If you force your opponents to fold when you have them drawing
thin, you will almost never win big pots unless you have A-A against K-K. Of course, you will lose
when the situation is reversed and you have K-K versus A-A. You must learn to effectively
ignore ‚Äúcold deck‚Äù situations and focus on ways to win your opponents‚Äô stacks in situations
where they will not get yours when the situation is reversed. Putting your opponents in
situations where they can realistically make errors is the key to making money from weak
opponents.

### TOPIC: Calling Stations
Some of your opponents will not be capable of folding any hand they deem to have any amount
of potential on the flop, turn and perhaps even the river. These calling stations simply never
fold! While these players are easy to demolish, they give most amateurs fits because they seem
to ‚Äúalways‚Äù get lucky on the turn or river. Many amateurs fail to realize that they are actually
committing huge errors by paying the calling stations off whenever they improve to a premium
hand. Even 8-2 is going to beat A-A on a J-8-3 board 19% of the time. If you pay attention, most
calling stations will make it clear when they have the best hand.
You will find that most calling stations act in a generally passive manner unless they have a
strong hand, effectively putting them in the straightforward, loose, passive category. However,
they are willing to call much larger bets with a much wider range than they should. This means
you should be more inclined to reraise them for value before the flop. Compared to the
polarized reraising range discussed when playing against good, tight, aggressive players, you
should reraise with an unpolarized range against calling stations. This range is roughly 7-7+,
A-T+, K-J+, and Q-Js. Notice that there are effectively no pure bluffs in this range. Remember, if
your opponent is not capable of folding, there is no point in bluffing. Since your opponent will
call your reraises with junky hands, such as A-3, K-8, and 7-5, you can reraise with a much wider
range purely for value because you expect to be called by numerous hands you dominate.
After the flop you should value bet relentlessly. Against the most extreme calling stations who
will call bets on all three streets with any pair, if you flop a hand such as J-T on Q-J-6-7-2, you
can realistically value bet all three streets.
Previously it was discussed that when choosing your bet size you should generally bet smaller
when your opponent‚Äôs range is weak. That advice goes out the window against extreme calling
stations who do not care how much you bet. As long as your bet is not exorbitantly large, they
will find an excuse to call. With J-T on Q-J-6-7-2, feel free to bet fairly large, perhaps 80% of the
size of the pot, on all three streets.
When value betting on the river, which is where most amateur small stakes cash game players
fail to apply pressure, your bet needs to get called by a worse hand at least 50% of the time in
order for you to profit. If you expect your calling station opponent to call your river bet on the
Q-J-6-7-2 board with any one pair hand or better that would realistically call a preflop raise, J-T
will win roughly 65% of the time, making it an easy value bet. If you fail to make thin value bets
against calling stations, you are leaving significant money on the table.
It is mandatory to keep in mind that if a calling station, known for his passive play, decides to
raise or check-raise, you must have the discipline to make a big fold, at least until you have
proof he is capable of running an aggressive bluff when you are applying pressure. Just because
a player is involved in lots of pots does not mean he is aggressive. Against typical calling
stations, you should value bet overly wide but fold when they show the first sign of strength.
This will allow you to extract maximum value while getting off the hook whenever they get
lucky to outdraw you. The inability to get off the hook when outdrawn is another spot where
most amateurs spew significant money.

### TOPIC: Which Strategy is Ideal?
The strategy you should employ depends almost entirely on how your opponents are playing. If
they are primarily tight and passive, you should play like a maniac, at least until it becomes
clear that your opponent is not going to fold a decently strong hand. If your opponents are all
blatant maniacs who cannot resist the temptation to bet when you check to them, you should
play in a tight, passive manner, giving them every possible opportunity to bluff.
While getting well out of line to exploit your opponents feels amazing, you will find that, as a
default, you should play a tight, aggressive strategy in most small stakes cash games. This is
because the general player pool usually plays in a loose, passive manner. These players are
incapable of folding marginal made hands even when it is clear they are beat. If your opponents
tend to rarely fold, there is little reason to attempt to bluff with a high frequency.
For example, it is quite common for five players to limp, you raise on the button to $12 with
A-Q, and three of the five limpers call. The flop comes Q-T-7. Everyone checks to you, you bet
$30, and one player calls. The turn is a (Q-T-7)-3. Your opponent checks, you bet $44, and he
calls. The river is the (Q-T-7-3)-5. He checks, you go all-in for $114, and he proudly calls with
Q-J, doubling you up with almost no risk.
Other times, the player with Q-J will check-raise on the flop because he assumes that if you only
call the check-raise, you cannot have top pair or better. Instead of check-calling your $30 flop
bet, he may instead check-raise the minimum, to $60. At that point, you should usually call $30
more and not fold to additional pressure. Of course, you could be beat, but if you know your
opponent overvalues top pair, you will have the best hand most of the time. It should be clear
that going all-in on the flop is usually not a good idea because that will tip your opponent off to
the fact that you actually think your hand is strong, possibly allowing him to make a snug fold.
In order to exploit players who hang around way too long with marginal one pair hands (which
will be most of the player pool) you generally need to start with either superior preflop hands
or hands that can easily flop well, such as 2-2, K-Q, and 7-6s. In order to start with better hands
than your opponents, you must play a reasonably tight strategy.
As your postflop skills increase, you should start playing a bit looser before the flop, opting to
call raises and limp along a bit more often with the intention of attacking the pot with multiple
postflop bets when it is clear your opponents have weak holdings. This will allow you to slowly
grind up your stack with minimal risk. However, if you do not navigate tricky postflop situations
well, you can easily spew off a ton of money. On the other hand, if you never get involved in
tricky spots, you will never gain the experience required to excel.
For example, if three players limp, there is nothing wrong with calling from the cutoff or button
with a wide range of marginally playable hands, such as A-4, 2-2, K-9, and 8-6. If everyone
checks to you on the flop in a manner you perceive to be weak, you should take a stab at the
pot, betting 65% of the size of the pot, whether or not you have a strong hand.
As you better develop your hand reading abilities, you will be able to steal an increasing
number of pots that do not belong to you, while also getting off the hook with an otherwise
strong hand when you happen to be crushed. I frequently find myself in spots where someone
raises, someone calls, and I call with a decent hand like A-J, then flop J-T-7 or A-Q-6. The initial
raiser bets and the other player calls. While my hand could easily be best, if I get the vibe that
one of my opponents thinks he has a premium hand, I will fold. There are other times where I
will call or even raise, depending on my read. As you gain more experience at the poker table,
you will be able to navigate these tricky situations much better.
So, which strategy is best? It is one that maximally exploits your specific opponents‚Äô errors. If
you make a point of constantly identifying what your opponents do incorrectly, figure out the
adjustments you should make to take advantage of them, and then have the courage to get out
of line in order to exploit them, you will probably be the best player at the table.

### TOPIC: Preflop Strategy
While the most beneficial thing you can do to maximize your win rate is to get out of line in
order to exploit your opponents, it is important to have a fundamental understanding of how to
play technically sound poker. Although my overall strategy is quite robust (as outlined in
Jonathan Little on Live No-Limit Cash Games, Volume 1), I will outline some general principles
here. Unlike most high stakes poker games, you will find that a large portion of the pots in small
stakes games are limped. While I will discuss my strategy for raising and dealing with raises first,
be sure to pay attention to how I combat limpers later in this section.

### TOPIC: Preflop Raise Sizing
Before discussing which hands to play before the flop, I must address preflop bet sizing. If you
observe the average $1/$2 game, when someone raises after the action folds around to them,
they typically raise to between $8 and $15. When asked why they picked this sizing, they reply
‚Äúbecause that is how much we raise in this game!‚Äù It should be clear that this is not a
thoughtful answer. When you choose any bet size, you need to know why you are making that
decision.
In general, as your stack size increases, your preflop raise size should also increase. This is
because pots grow exponentially in no-limit games. You will find that if you make 2/3 pot bets
on the flop, turn and river, you will play much larger pots when you see a flop with 15 big blinds
in the pot compared to when there are only 7.5 big blinds in the pot. However, this does not
mean you should blindly choose large sizes.
As your postflop skill level increases compared to your opponents‚Äô, you want to see flops with
as little money in the pot as possible. The reason for this is that while you often don‚Äôt have a
large advantage preflop, you can have a very large advantage postflop. The more money you
put in the pot before the flop, the less you can capitalize on your postflop skills. The best
players, especially in the high stakes games (i.e. the players you should model your strategy
after), play a wide range of hands for small amounts of money before the flop. Their typical
raise size before the flop is 2 big blinds, which would be $4 at $1/$2. While I do not advocate
min-raising, I suggest you raise to 2.5 or 3 big blinds when everyone folds around to you,
assuming 100 big blind effective stacks. This sizing will allow you to easily play sizable pots
when you happen to flop a strong hand while giving you plenty of room to apply multiple
streets of aggression.
Perhaps most importantly, small preflop bet sizes allow your opponents to call with a wide
range of junk that will be relatively unplayable on most flops. The biggest problem with raises
larger than 3 big blinds is that they force reasonable opponents to play correctly. For example,
most decent players know to fold hands like A-9 and K-T to a 5 big blind preflop raise, but if you
raise to 3 big blinds, they will be tempted to call, or even reraise. By keeping your opponents in
with a wide range, you will be better able to extract huge amounts of value when you flop well,
while also pushing them off their hands when they flop poorly.
If you happen to find yourself in an overly soft game with players who never fold before the
flop to any raise size, you should simply play tight and make large raises. Still, in my experience,
even in soft games, when I raised to $15, I got far fewer callers compared to when I raised to
$6. This means that my opponents were making intelligent folds. The last thing you want to do
is force your opponents to play intelligently.
While you may feel uneasy using a bet size that is drastically different than the one everyone
else uses at your table, you must realize that you are learning to play in a manner that will force
your postflop skills to improve. Improving your postflop skills will help you become a better
poker player. The real reason most small stakes players use huge bet sizes is because they don‚Äôt
want their strong hands to get outdrawn. Their simple strategy is to limp with their marginal
hands, hoping to see a cheap flop, and raise huge with their premium hands. What they are
actually doing is playing in a blatantly straightforward manner that makes them easy to play
against. This strategy may work against their worst opponents, but when they face competent
competition, they get demolished.
You must accept that when you choose a smaller sizing, you will get outdrawn more often.
Getting outdrawn is not the end of the world, although you would not know that if you listened
to small stakes players converse. As your postflop skills increase, you will be able to navigate
tricky situations and make tight folds when your normally premium hand is in bad shape. For
example, suppose you raise with K-Q to $6 out of your $200 stack from early position and five
players call. The flop comes K-J-6. You bet $18 and an overly tight, straightforward player raises
to $70. This is a fairly easy spot to fold because your tight opponent would probably only make
this raise with a set or two pair. Most amateurs are simply unable to fold K-Q and get stacked,
whereas good players lose only a small amount.
While most amateurs view this as a reason to raise larger preflop, you must understand that
not every hand plays out in this manner. More often, instead of someone raising to $70,
someone calls the $18 bet with a hand like K-9 or Q-J. This player will then be unable to fold to
additional bets on the turn and river, allowing you to extract huge amounts of value. When this
happens, many amateurs don‚Äôt think much of it, but when they get outdrawn or have to make a
big fold, they are miserable. You must learn not to worry about whether or not you are winning
or losing in the short run because the short run is not what matters.
If you model your game after your $1/$2 opponents, you should expect to stay in the $1/$2
games for quite a while. If you instead model your strategies after high stakes players, you will
have a much better chance of reaching their skill level. Do not fall into the habit of choosing a
specific strategy simply because that is what everyone else does at your table.

### TOPIC: When the action is folded to you
When everyone folds to you, you should almost always enter the pot with a raise to roughly 3
big blinds. This will disguise your range of hands, which will make you difficult to read,
especially compared to most of your opponents who raise with their strong hands and limp
with their marginal hands. I strongly suggest you play your entire playable preflop range in the
same manner. This means acting exactly the same and raising to the same amount with each
hand. Your goal should be to give away as little information as possible. There is no need to get
fancy by limp-reraising with A-A, hoping to trap someone, or raising huge with 7-2 in an
attempt to steal the blinds and stroke your ego.
It is worth pointing out that the range of hands I suggest you raise with is a bit looser than I
would suggest to the typical amateur. Remember, my goal is to make you a skilled postflop
player who is capable of combating both strong and weak opponents. This means being
comfortable playing both tight and loose ranges. If you are doubtful about your postflop skills,
feel free to tighten up the ranges, but realize that you will only improve by getting experience
outside your comfort zone.
From early position, you should play a strong range of hands because you have to worry about
everyone else at the table waking up with a stronger hand. While some players opt to have a
raising range and a limping range from early position, I do not think that is necessary if you use
the 2.5 to 3 big blind raise size I suggest. With $200 stacks, you do not want to raise to $12 with
6-6 from first position because if you get reraised to $35, you have to fold. However, you can
raise to $5 and call a reraise to $15. With your small pairs, you need to be getting 10:1 implied
odds to justify a call, meaning the effective stack needs to contain at least 10 times the amount
you have to put in now. Since you have to put in $10 more, you are getting 20:1, assuming $200
stacks. With suited connectors and suited Aces, you need to get 20:1, which will often make
calling reraises with these hands unprofitable.
The range of hands I open raise from early position does not change too much based on my
opponents because the overriding factor is that someone yet to act will pick up a strong hand a
decent amount of the time. As your position improves, you can play a wider range that widens
even more based on your opponents‚Äô tendencies. Remember, the ranges below assume
everyone folds to you. If someone raises before the action gets to you or someone limps,
everything changes.
From early position, this is my typical raising range:
You may find this range to be overly tight, but when you are out of position against the entire
table, the normally outdated adage of ‚Äútight is right‚Äù applies. The purpose of raising 9-8s and
2-2 is that you want to be able to realistically represent the nuts on all flops. If you only raise
with premium pairs and premium big cards, you will be exploitable on middle and low flops
because the best hand you can ever have is an overpair. You always want at least some
potential to have the nuts after the flop. Conversely, if your opponents are overly aggressive
before the flop, you should expect to get reraised a decent amount of the time and generally
should fold small pairs and suited connectors.
From middle position, this is my typical raising range:
Notice this range is significantly wider than the early position range, but still not too crazy. If I
have reason to believe my opponents will frequently reraise before the flop, I will tighten up a
bit. If I expect my opponents to rarely reraise, I add in a few more hands with potential, such as
all suited Aces and a few more suited connectors. It is important to realize that from early and
middle position, hands like Q-Jo and A-8o should almost always be folded because it is likely
you are dominated by someone yet to act who will not fold to a preflop raise. You will find that
most small stakes players vastly overplay these hands because they perceive them to be strong
whereas in reality, they are quite weak.
From the cutoff, this is my typical raising range.
From late position, my range is based much more on the players yet to act. Again, if I expect
them to frequently reraise, I will tighten up. If I expect them to play in a tight, straightforward
manner, I will raise an even wider range. If you expect the players yet to act to be overly tight,
feel free to raise a significantly wider range.
From the button, this is my typical raising range.
Similar to the cutoff, my button raising range depends entirely on the players in the blinds.
There are times when I have a fairly snug button raising range and other times when I raise any
two cards. Always quantify how you expect your opponents to react and then adjust your range
accordingly.
From the small blind, your strategy should depend entirely on your opponent in the big blind.
Limping becomes a reasonable option, especially if you think the Big Blind will play in a very
straightforward manner. If you decide to limp with a wide range of junky hands, such as J-6o
and 7-4o, you should also include some premium hands in your limping range so you are not
easily exploited. If your opponent is somewhat tight, it is generally best to raise a wide range,
perhaps as wide as any two cards, but that strategy is becoming much less effective as players
have improved their big blind defending strategy over time. If your opponent is overly loose
and aggressive, there is nothing wrong with simply folding your junk, opting instead to play
most of your pots in position. I would approach a generic small blind situation by raising most
of the time, but my strategy would be quite fluid, depending on my opponent.
In most small stakes games, the players in the blinds can agree to ‚Äúchop‚Äù. This is where both
blinds take back their money and move on to the next hand. Assuming the rake is low, perhaps
$4 at the most, I do not chop. If the rake is large, chopping becomes a good idea because, even
with masterful play, you cannot overcome the house‚Äôs edge. While I have numerous reasons for
why you should typically not chop, the main reason is because you should get experience
playing out of position and short-handed. If you never get experience in these situations, you
will be ill-prepared for when you move up to the higher stakes games, where the blinds rarely
chop. You will also find that the vast majority of the $1/$2 player pool is completely unaware of
how to play blind versus blind. Some players will be too loose while others will be too tight. If
you work hard on this aspect of your game, you will be able to hold your own from the small
blind and win a large amount when you are in the big blind.

### TOPIC: When your opponents will call large preflop raises
Occasionally, you will find yourself in a game where your opponents are willing to call your
preflop raises with an extraordinarily wide range. Some of these players will be completely
oblivious to your preflop raise size. They will stop at nothing to see a flop with the entire range
of hands they deem playable. These are the easiest players in the game to beat. All you have to
do is wait around for a value hand and then apply significant pressure.
Imagine you are in a game where your opponents will call up to $30 before the flop with the
top 30% of hands. You should raise huge with your premium hands, perhaps 9-9+ and A-J+, and
raise smaller, perhaps to the ‚Äústandard‚Äù $6 with your Broadway and drawing hands. This will
result in you getting as much money in the pot as possible when you have a huge edge while
having the possibility of playing a huge pot postflop when you improve to a premium hand. Be
aware most players will quickly figure out this simple strategy and will adjust by only playing
strong hands against you. I also do not think there are many players who will call a 15 big blind
preflop raise with hands like K-8o whereas many would likely call a 3 big blind raise. However, I
recognize that some games are extremely soft, especially in locations where poker is relatively
new. I will discuss how to attack limpers and how to play postflop versus these players in a later
section, but for now, realize that almost all of your value from these players will come from
piling your chips in when you have what is usually the best hand.

### TOPIC: When you get reraised
When you raise and get reraised, you must figure out the probable range of the reraiser. If the
reraiser is tight, meaning he will only reraise with A-A, K-K, Q-Q, J-J, A-K, and A-Q, you should
fold all but your best hands. If a tight reraiser uses a huge bet size, for example, reraising to $45
over your initial $6 raise, simply fold and wait until you pick up A-A or K-K. This section will
assume your opponent makes a ‚Äústandard‚Äù reraise to between $16 and $24. With A-A and K-K,
you should almost always be happy getting your stack in. With Q-Q, J-J, and A-K, your play
should vary drastically depending on your opponent‚Äôs willingness to get all-in with good, but
not amazing, hands, such as T-T and A-Q. If your opponent will stack off with T-T and A-Q,
getting in with J-J and A-K is great, but if he will only reraise and get all-in with A-A and K-K, you
are best off calling with those hands, opting to see what develops after the flop.
When the reraiser is tight
If the reraiser is tight and you have a marginal hand, such as A-J or K-Q, it is usually prudent to
fold before the flop to anything larger than a tiny raise (perhaps $13 over your $6 raise). For
example, if you raise to $6 with K-Q and face a reraise from a tight player to $24, you should
certainly fold. Moreover, you will find that almost no one in small stakes games folds in this
situation. This is a major leak of the entire player pool. When you are usually dominated or in a
situation where you will have large reverse implied odds, meaning you will either lose a large
pot or win a small one, you should fold.
Notice what happens when you call a tight player‚Äôs reraise with K-Q and you flop top pair. If the
flop comes K-6-4, your opponent will be willing to get all-in with A-A, K-K, and A-K. He will
probably only put in a small amount of money with J-J, T-T, and A-Q before giving up. If it comes
Q-7-3, he will put his stack in with A-A, K-K, Q-Q, and A-Q, all of which crush you, while putting
in very little with J-J, T-T, and A-K. Notice your opponent will always know where he stands
whereas you will be in the dark. Of course, when you completely miss the flop, you will have to
fold. You want to avoid high reverse implied odds situations at all costs. A-J, K-J, and Q-J all fall
into the category of having high reverse implied odds. Avoid playing large pots against strong
ranges with these hands whenever possible. Even though these hands are normally ‚Äústrong‚Äù,
when your opponent‚Äôs range is overly tight, these are some of the worst hands you can play.
When facing a tight player‚Äôs reraise, it is important to recognize which hands have been
demoted to ‚Äúdrawing hands‚Äù: 9-9, 2-2, A-Js, A-2s, K-Qs, and 8-7s are all reasonable hands to call
a reraise with, assuming you are getting the proper implied odds. Remember, with pairs you
want to get at least 10:1 and with suited connectors and suited Aces, you want to get at least
20:1. Assuming $200 effective stacks, if you raise to $7 and your tight opponent reraises to $30,
you should fold all drawing hands because you are only getting 8.7:1 implied odds ((200/(30-7)
= 8.7:1 implied odds). You must have the discipline to recognize when you are not getting the
proper implied odds, even with hands that are normally quite strong. Of course, when you have
a junky hand, you should always fold.

### TOPIC: When the reraiser is loose
Your strategy should be quite different when the reraiser is loose, compared to when he is
tight. If he is willing to reraise with a wide range, perhaps any pair, any Broadway hand, any A-x,
and various suited hands, the biggest error you can make is to fold too often.
With your premium hands, it is usually best to 4-bet, assuming your opponent will not fold too
often. You should go out of your way to ensure he feels roped into the pot. For example, if you
raise to $6 with A-A and your loose opponent reraises to $20, you should usually 4-bet to $40
then make a $32 postflop continuation bet on most boards. Of course, if he figures out this bet
sizing tendency, you should either use a similar sizing with your entire range or switch to
reraising tiny almost exclusively as a bluff, at least until he figures out your adjustment. You will
know your opponent has figured out your bet sizing tendency when he stops paying you off
when you have strong hands.
As an aside, the term ‚Äú3-bet‚Äù comes from the now defunct game of Limit Hold‚Äôem. The first bet
is the big blind, the second bet, or the ‚Äú2-bet‚Äù, is the initial raise, and the third bet, the ‚Äú3-bet‚Äù,
is the reraise. A ‚Äú4-bet‚Äù is a reraise of the reraise.
With your premium hands, you have the option of just calling your opponent‚Äôs reraise. Do not
be afraid to call with your premium hands. While you will occasionally get outdrawn, you
ensure your opponent stays in the pot. This guarantees that he has the opportunity to commit a
major postflop blunder. Suppose you raise to $6 with Q-Q and a loose player reraises to $22 in
position. You know he will fold all of his junky hands, which you think make up a large part of
his range, to any 4-bet. This is an excellent spot to call, especially if he will make multiple
postflop bluffs because he assumes you will not have a premium hand, given you didn‚Äôt 4-bet
preflop. If you 4-bet this type of player, you allow him to get off the hook with a minimal loss.
When you have a good, but not amazing hand, such as A-J or K-Q, it is usually best to just call a
loose player‚Äôs reraise. When you call in this situation, your goal should not be to fold every time
you miss. When you flop any sort of equity, which will often be the case when you have a
gutshot straight draw or better, you should at least check-call and occasionally check-push
all-in. Suppose you raise with K -Q
to $6 and one of these players raises to $22 out of his
$200 stack. You call. The flop comes J -9 -6 , giving you a gutshot straight draw, backdoor
flush draw, and overcards. You should check, giving your opponent the chance to bluff. If your
opponent makes any bet larger than perhaps $20, you should strongly consider going all-in. You
will win the pot every time your opponent has nothing, which will often be the case due to him
having a wide range. Even if you get called, you will usually have a decent amount of equity.
Notice that even against A-J (top pair, top kicker) you will win 40% of the time.
When you have a drawing hand and face an aggressive reraiser, your play depends primarily on
the implied odds you are getting and how wide your opponent‚Äôs range is. It is important to
realize that A-Js and 8-8 are value hands that should rarely be folded when facing a loose
reraiser, whereas they are marginal drawing hands when facing a tight reraiser. Assuming you
are not getting the proper implied odds to call with traditional drawing hands, such as small
pairs, suited Aces, and suited connectors, you should strongly consider reraising as a bluff or
folding. You can also make this play as a bluff with your hands containing a blocker, primarily
A-x and K-x.
Reraising as a bluff with a big card in your hand is referred to as reraising with a ‚Äúblocker‚Äù. The
presence of a big card in your hand makes it less likely that your opponent has a premium hand.
For example, when you have an Ace in your hand, your opponent will have A-A half as often, as
compared to when you don‚Äôt. The reason for this is that there are six combinations of A-A and
you have removed three of them. Similarly, he will only have A-K 75% as often since there are
16 combinations of A-K and you‚Äôve removed four of them.
Suppose you raise 2-2, A-7s, or K-5s to $6 out of your $200 stack from middle position and a
loose player reraises from the button to $20. This is an excellent spot to reraise to $48 with the
intention of folding if your opponent goes all-in, assuming you think he will only be willing to
5-bet all-in with premium hands. If he calls your 4-bet, you can make a relatively small
continuation bet of $32 on the flop and usually steal the pot every time he misses.
Be aware that if your opponent is a calling station, these bluffs are not ideal. Simply wait for
premium hands before putting money in the pot. Having a balanced range containing a mixture
of value hands and bluffs is a skill you must master if you want to succeed at the high stakes
games. The main way you will profit from small stakes games is by having the patience and
discipline to build large pots with your strong hands while getting out of the way with your
weak hands. Fancy plays are not necessary; they will simply get you in trouble.

### TOPIC: When there is a raise before you
Frequently, there will be a raise before the action gets to you. This section outlines my default
strategy for when everyone folds to someone, who makes a preflop raise, then everyone
between you and the raiser folds, with no one calling in between.
It is important to figure out the preflop raiser‚Äôs range and tailor your strategy accordingly. For
example, if you know the raiser loves to limp with all his marginal and junky hands while only
raising with his premium hands, you should assign him a tight range when he raises, even
though he limps almost every hand. Do not fall into the habit of thinking ‚Äúthis guy sees lots of
flops, so he must be weak every time he puts money in the pot.‚Äù
Some players (but certainly not all) adjust their ranges based on their position. Most competent
players play a tight range from early position and a loose range from late position. Most supertight players play only premium hands from every position. Some maniacs are willing to raise
with any two cards from any position. It is not uncommon to find two different players who
have drastically different ranges when they raise, even though they raise with the exact same
percentage of hands. One player may raise with the top 15% of hands from all positions
whereas the other player may raise with 5% of hands from early position, 10% of hands from
middle position, 25% of hands from the cutoff, and 40% of hands from the button. Do not fool
yourself into thinking all ‚Äúreasonably active‚Äù players have the same range in all situations.
As a mild over-simplification, hands can be broken down into strong hands (premium pairs and
premium big cards), marginal hands (junky big cards and A-x), drawing hands (small pairs,
suited connectors, and suited Aces), and weak hands (anything else). It is important to develop
a strategy for playing each type of hand against the various players you will encounter on a
regular basis. The following sections will discuss how to play each type of hand against generic
tight raisers and loose raisers.
It is worth noting that some players will make gigantic preflop raises with their entire range,
perhaps as large as $30. Against most of these players, unless you have a strong hand, perhaps
7-7+, A-J+, and K-Q, you should simply fold and wait for a better spot. If you find yourself in a
game where everyone makes huge raises, sit back and wait for premium hands. At that point,
the blinds effectively do not matter. You are in a game where all you have to do is wait for a
premium hand, then pile in your money. Do not fall into the habit of calling $15 raises with the
same range of hands with which you call $6 raises. Failing to account for preflop bet sizing is a
huge leak of most small stakes players.

### TOPIC: When a tight player raises
When you have a premium hand versus a tight raiser, you must realize that some normally
premium hands, such as A-Q and J-J, become less than premium. This should lead you to call
with most of your strong hands, besides A-A and K-K, unless you can confidently reraise with
the intention of folding if 4-bet. For example, if you have J-J and face a raise from a tight player
who you expect to have a tight range, you can 3-bet with the intention of folding if he 4-bets,
because you know with a high degree of certainty that he will call with hands you beat, such as
9-9 and A-J, and reraise with hands that beat you, such as A-A and Q-Q. While reraising for
information is rarely the correct play, when you are against an overly tight opponent, the
information you receive will usually be accurate. With A-A and K-K, it is almost always an error
to not reraise and get all-in. If your K-K happens to run into A-A, that is simply bad luck.
As for bet sizing, when deciding to 3-bet a tight raiser for value, you can get away with making a
larger than normal 3-bet because your opponent will be incapable of folding his reasonably
strong hands, which should be his entire preflop raising range. For example, if a tight player
raises to $8 out of his $200 stack, feel free to reraise to $28 with A-A because your opponent is
unlikely to fold any part of his range. Of course, if you think he will be disciplined and fold, you
should revert to a standard sizing of $22.
When you have a marginal hand, such as A-J, K-Q, and J-T, versus a tight raiser, you have to
figure out how you fare versus the range. If your opponent is raising with a legitimately tight
range of only big pairs and premium big cards, you should fold your marginal hands because
they will be dominated most of the time. It may feel incredibly nitty to fold K-Q to a preflop
raise, but it is often the correct play when your opponent is abnormally tight. If your opponent
is a bit looser, willing to raise with most pairs, most big cards, and lots of suited connectors, you
should tend to call with these hands. You should consider turning some of them, mainly the
ones that are a bit too weak to call, such as A-9 and K-T, into bluffs by reraising exactly as you
would with your premium hands. This will add a few bluffs to your range and make you more
difficult to play against. Of course, if your opponent will never fold to your 3-bet and be quite
willing to call multiple postflop bets, having lots of bluffs in your range is a bad idea. Do not
attempt to bluff someone who is not capable of folding.
With your drawing hands that have large implied odds, such as 2-2 and 8-7s, you should almost
always call the preflop raise of a tight player. If your opponent is incapable of folding an
overpair after the flop, you desperately want to see as many flops as possible with hands that
have huge implied odds. If you flop two pair or better, you are almost certain to stack your
opponent.
With your junky hands (which is any hand not covered already) you should simply fold. Hands
like A-5, K-9, and 9-8 are simply not playable versus tight raisers, especially when they make
large preflop raises. The last thing you want to do is call a raise with A-5, flop top pair, and then
have to call multiple bets with a marginal bluff catcher.
When I first started playing poker in 2003, everyone in my local game thought you had to play
any hand containing an Ace because it is the best card in the deck. Once I figured out the
concept of reverse implied odds, I started to fold my weak Aces, particularly when facing a raise
from a tight player. My win rate went through the roof. Especially against tight players, do not
feel obligated to play any hand simply because it is normally considered to be strong. If your
opponent‚Äôs range is A-A, K-K, Q-Q, J-J, and A-K, hands like A-Q and T-T are in horrible shape.

### TOPIC: When a loose player raises
When you have a premium hand versus a loose raiser, you should play aggressively, assuming
your opponent will believe you are reraising with more than just the most premium hands. If
you have been overly tight, you should strongly consider calling with your premium hands
because most competent players will prudently fold to your aggression. All in all, in a generic
small stakes game, unless you make a gigantic raise, most players will call your reraise with
almost their entire range in order to see a flop.
For example, if an active player raises to $8 at $1/$2 and you have J-J, you should usually
reraise to about $22. This will put your opponent in a miserable situation. While he should
almost certainly fold and concede his initial raise, many players will call with their entire preflop
raising range. If your opponent 4-bets to $60, you should usually fold unless both you and your
opponent have reasonably active images. You will find that very few players 4-bet in small
stakes cash games without the intention of getting all-in. Against a ‚Äústandard‚Äù range, worthy of
getting all-in, A-A, K-K, Q-Q, and A-K, your J-J only has 36% equity. A-K only has 38% equity. This
means that you should typically fold these hands when 4-bet unless you have a good reason to
believe your opponent will 4-bet with more than only premium hands. If you are unsure
whether your opponent will 4-bet in a face-up manner, you should call the initial preflop raise
with hands you are not willing to get all-in. You do not have to reraise every time you are dealt
a typically strong hand. Think ahead in order to avoid situations where you will be unsure of
how to proceed.
While your marginal hands should be played in a cautious manner against tight raisers, they
should be played much more aggressively against loose raisers. This is because loose raisers will
be involved with numerous hands that are dominated by marginal big cards. Typically, this
should lead you to reraise hands like A-J, K-Q, and Q-T when facing a raise from a loose opener.
You should reraise these hands exactly as you would your premium hands. While it may feel
risky to reraise with Q-T, you will find that most of the time, the initial raiser will call and then
check-fold the flop to your half pot continuation bet when he misses. This will result in you
scooping these pots about 60% of the time due to your fold equity. When combined with the
fact that you will make the best hand sometimes, this play is hugely profitable.
As a simple example of this concept, imagine what happens when a loose player raises, you call
with K-J, and the flop comes T-8-4. Your opponent is going to make a standard continuation bet
and you are going to fold. Instead, if he raises to $7 and you 3-bet to $20, he is going to call
preflop and then check-fold to your continuation bet on T-8-4 when he fails to improve.
Just as against tight raisers, you should look to flop a strong made hand or draw with your
drawing hands. The only time you should consider reraising preflop with your drawing hands is
when the initial raise comes from late position and you expect your opponent to frequently call
your reraise and then check-fold the flop. This is because your opponent probably doesn‚Äôt have
a hand that can pay you off if you improve to a premium hand after the flop, meaning you don‚Äôt
actually have huge implied odds. Turning these drawings hands into preflop semi-bluffs (an
aggressive action with a hand that is probably not best at the moment but could easily improve
to be the best on a future street) is probably a better play. Notice that this situation is similar to
when you have a marginal hand and reraise a loose raiser, except drawing hands have a realistic
chance of flopping the nuts.
With your junky hands, you should generally fold. The only time you should consider playing
junk is when you expect the initial raiser to fold if you reraise. Suppose a loose raiser makes it
$8 from the cutoff and you are in the small blind with A-6, K-5, or 9-8. None of these hands are
strong enough to call. Therefore, if you expect to have a large amount of fold equity, meaning
you think the initial raiser will fold most of the time to your reraise either because you have a
tight image or you expect your opponent‚Äôs range to be full of trash, you should reraise. From
out of position, you should reraise a bit larger than normal to discourage action because you
want to avoid playing large pots from out of position. So, make it $28 or $32. This will
frequently result in your opponent folding. When he elects to call, you can make a continuation
bet of $30 on most flops and frequently steal the pot. If your opponent doesn‚Äôt fold, you should
generally only continue bluffing when a scary card comes on the turn or when you have
improved to a strong hand. Remember that it is perfectly acceptable to concede the pot when
it is clear your opponent has a strong hand which he isn‚Äôt going to fold.

### TOPIC: When there is a raise and a caller
When there is a raise and one caller before the action gets to you, your main focus should be
on the initial raiser‚Äôs range. Again, you have to assess if he is raising with a tight or loose range.
You usually don‚Äôt have to worry too much about the caller because unless he is overly tight and
passive, he probably would have reraised if he had a strong hand.
When the raiser has a tight range, you should still reraise with your premium hands, A-A, K-K,
Q-Q, and A-K and you should tend to make a reraise that is a bit smaller than the size of the pot.
With your strong hands, such as J-J, T-T, 9-9, and A-Q, as well as your more marginal hands, it is
usually best to call and see what develops. While there is a bit of value in protecting your
strong, but not amazing, hands, you will find that most of your value comes from flopping top
pair or better before investing too much money. Remember that most of your value from small
stakes cash games will come from extracting maximum value from your strong made hands, not
bloating the pot preflop when you are slightly ahead. You should also call with all of your
drawing hands. With your hands that are usually dominated, such as A-9, K-10, 8-6, and 7-3,
you should fold. There is no point in getting involved with hands that are drawing thin.
When the raiser has a loose range, you can consider getting a bit out of line, especially if the
initial raiser is prone to fold when reraised. If he calls a reraise with his entire opening range,
you should tend to reraise primarily for value, although you must recognize that your value
range will be much wider compared to when you face a tight raiser.
If the initial raiser folds most of his hands to a pot sized reraise, feel free to get out of line as
often as possible, at least until you think your opponent has adjusted. Hands like A-x and K-x
are excellent candidates to reraise because they are too weak to call and see a flop, even
against a loose opener. You should strongly consider reraising a bit larger with your bluffs,
perhaps to 1.2 times the size of the pot, compared to your value hands. You will find that most
players are unaware of changes you make to your bet sizing. They see a large bet and think ‚Äútoo
rich for my blood!‚Äù They see a reasonable bet and think ‚ÄúI can afford that.‚Äù Of course, if your
opponents are paying attention, you should probably size all your bets the same. However,
given that most of your opponents will not recognize your bet sizing adjustments, you should
experiment with getting out of line.
Once it becomes clear that the initial raiser will rarely fold to any reasonably sized reraise, you
should reraise to that size exclusively for value. Hands as weak as A-T and K-J can be reraised
against this type of opponent because they will call with many inferior hands. Of course, once
the initial raiser calls your reraise, the caller will be somewhat prone to see a flop as well.
However, if you frequently have your opponents dominated, you should not mind three-way
action. As long as you play intelligently after the flop, you should welcome investing a
reasonable amount of money before the flop when you tend to have at least one of your
opponents dominated.
Marginal high card hands are difficult to play versus players who will frequently call reasonably
sized reraises. If your opponent generally folds to a large reraise, turning hands like A-8 and K-9
into bluffs by reraising large is probably the best play. If your opponent calls almost any reraise,
you can profitably call with these hands, assuming you play well after the flop. You must be
aware that when you flop top pair, you do not have the nuts. When you flop top pair, you
should call one or two postflop bets but then concede the pot to additional aggression. As in
most situations, you should call with your drawing hands and fold your junk.
It is important to recognize that some preflop callers only call raises with strong hands. Against
these callers, you should be less inclined to reraise with your bluffs and instead only reraise for
value. If you expect the caller to be abnormally strong, you should only reraise with only
premium hands. Always be sure to account for each player in the pot because the presence of
one specific player could drastically change the way you approach a situation.
As I said before, when there is a raise and multiple callers, you should focus primarily on the
initial raiser. Again, this is because if any of the callers had a premium hand, they would
typically reraise. Given that there will be more dead, or almost dead, money in the pot, you
should be even more inclined to make a squeeze play with your hands that do not flop well,
such as A-x and K-x. You should also reraise your premium hands for value. I urge you to
experiment with various bet sizes to determine if there is an amount you can regularly reraise
to that steals the pot preflop. If you can routinely steal the pot with a bluff by reraising to $47
when a loose player raises to $7 and three people call, you will scoop up lots of dead money in
the long run. While this play may feel quite risky (because you are investing 1/4th of your 100
big blind stack), it only needs to succeed 60% of the time to show an immediate profit; and that
profit will be greater when you flop a hand you can continue with. You will find that $47 is ‚Äútoo
expensive‚Äù for most players.

### TOPIC: When there are limpers
In small stakes cash games, it is quite common to see numerous players limp with a wide range.
This is because most players want to see if the flop connects with their hole cards before
folding. It is important to realize that players limp with varying ranges. In order to take
advantage of their weak play, you must figure out the limpers‚Äô tendencies and adjust
accordingly.
Most players who limp preflop will raise their premium hands, limp their marginal and junky
hands, and fold complete trash. These players are comfortable raising hands like A-J and K-Q
but are uneasy about raising with ‚Äúmarginal‚Äù hands such as K-J and 9-7s. When these players
limp, you can effectively remove the top 10% of hands from their range. This means that they
will often fold to a sizable preflop raise and when they don‚Äôt, at best they will flop a marginal
hand such as top pair with a mediocre kicker.
Other limpers limp with their entire playable hand range, either because they realize removing
the top part of their range is not a good idea or because they are blatantly passive. These
players could easily have premium hands in their range, even when they limp and then call your
preflop raise. You must proceed with a bit more caution against these players.
It is also important to realize that some limpers limp with a small range of both monsters and
some reasonably playable hands, such as A-A, 3-3, A-4s, and 7-6s, from early position but a
wide range from late position, such as K-7, 8-6 and 6-3. You must adjust your strategy according
to the range you expect them to have in each position.

### TOPIC: When there is one limper
Your strategy when facing one limper depends primarily on the limper‚Äôs probable range, the
limper‚Äôs position, your position, your image, and your hand. Your position is important because
if you are in early position, you have to worry about everyone else at the table waking up with a
strong hand whereas if you are in late position, you only have to worry about the few remaining
players. Your image is important because if your opponents expect you to raise their limps
frequently with a wide range, they will adjust and fight back. If they expect you to play in a
blatantly straightforward manner, raising when you have premium hands and calling with
everything else, you should actively look for spots where you can steal their limps.
For example, if you have a tight, straightforward image, when a weak player limps at $1/$2
from middle position and the action folds to you, regardless of your position, you should
strongly consider raising to an amount you expect your opponent will frequently fold to with
hands that flop poorly, such as A-4, K-6, and Q-4. If you think your opponent will always call a
raise to $8 but will usually fold to a raise to $12, make it $12. If you happen to have a premium
hand and want action, then you should simply raise to $8. Obviously if your opponents figure
out this strategy, you should adjust to a more balanced strategy of raising to the same amount
with all of the hands you plan to play (probably to $12 because you will have more stealing
opportunities than premium hands). If instead of a tight image, you have a maniacal image or
your opponents will not allow you to easily push them around, you should never bluff and
instead raise almost entirely for value.
It is vitally important that you be aware of your image at the table and then make plays
designed to take advantage of your image. If your opponents expect you to raise with a wide
range, tighten up. If they expect you to be overly tight, steal whenever you have the
opportunity. Realize that your opponents only know what they see. If you have raised or
reraised four times in the last orbit but have yet to show down a hand, your opponents will
think you are crazy even if you have had premium hands every time. If you think that your
opponents think you are tight, whereas in reality, they think you are crazy, you will make
significant errors. That being said, in small stakes games, some players aren‚Äôt aware of image
concerns at all. Don‚Äôt overthink yourself. While your image is a huge concern, the rest of this
section will assume you have a relatively generic image of being reasonably in line most of the
time.

### TOPIC: When facing a limper from early position
When facing one limper from early position who has a wide range and you are also in early
position, you should tend to raise with your reasonably strong hands, such as 9-9, A-J, and K-Q,
and call with your drawing hands, such as 4-4 and 7-6s. You should almost always fold your
junky hands, such as A-x and 9-7. With your marginal hands, such as K-J and J-T, your play
depends on what you expect the players yet to act to do. If you expect them to frequently raise,
assuming both you and the initial limper must be weak, you should either raise or fold these
hands. While folding is a bit tight, it will keep you from playing out of position with hands that
are easily dominated. If you expect the players yet to act to also limp with a wide range, you
should limp with your marginal hands because the limping ranges of the players behind you will
contain many hands you dominate.
It is important to notice that limping with marginal hands will often result in you flopping a
marginal top pair in a multiway pot. For example, suppose a weak limper limps from early
position and you call from early position with K-Js. Four other players limp, including the blinds.
The flop comes K-T-5. Your hand‚Äôs value will vary wildly based on your opponents‚Äô actions. For
example, if it is checked to the initial limper and he bets, you have an easy call. If everyone
checks to you, you have an easy bet. If the Small Blind bets, the Big Blind calls, and the initial
limper raises, you have an easy fold. Do not fall into the trap of blindly playing a large pot every
time you make top pair.
When facing one limper from early position who has a wide range and you are in middle or late
position, you should be more inclined to raise with a wide range because there are fewer
players yet to act. You should tend to raise your entire range of playable hands, including junky
hands like A-x and 9-7. This will result in your raising range being primarily hands that have the
limper dominated, plus a few bluffs. As discussed earlier, you should strongly consider tailoring
your bet size to induce the action you want. Limping behind with a drawing hands is acceptable,
although raising in order to play a heads-up pot in position is usually the best play.
When facing one limper from early position who has a wide range and you are in the small
blind, you should limp with a wide range of hands that are not strong enough to raise for value.
Your raising range should depend almost entirely on how wide the limper‚Äôs range is and how
you expect him to play postflop. If he is difficult to play against after the flop, usually because
he will not play blatantly straightforwardly, you should raise with only premium and other
strong hands, such as 9-9, A-J, and K-Q. If he frequently folds to your preflop raise or calls and
then plays straightforwardly after the flop, you can raise a bit wider, such as with hands like
A-9, K-T, and Q-J. You should tend to limp with your marginal hands and drawing hands. You
can also limp with some of your junky hands, such as A-2, K-7, 8-6, and 5-4, purely due to your
pot odds. However, be careful with hands containing one big card and one small card as those
have huge reverse implied odds, meaning when you flop a decent hand like top pair, you will
usually lose a large pot or win a tiny one.
Suppose a bad limper who will fold to a large raise limps from early position. Everyone folds
around to you in the small blind. You should tend to raise with a wide range because unless the
Big Blind wakes up with a hand, you will steal the pot. With your value hands, such as 9-9, A-J,
and K-Q, you should consider raising a bit smaller to induce the limper to call. Remember, you
don‚Äôt want to force your opponents to fold when you have them crushed. If you happen to
know the limper will call a reasonably sized raise with his entire range and then play
straightforwardly after the flop, you should consider raising to $10 with a wide range with the
intention of continuation betting $12 on most flops. While you will have very little preflop fold
equity, you will have a lot of postflop fold equity. It may feel risky to let your opponent see a
flop with a wide range, but if you manage to steal the $22 pot 65% of the time on the flop, this
play will be hugely profitable. If your opponent plays reasonably well after the flop, you should
be content to steal the pot before the flop by making a larger raise.
When facing one limper from early position who has a wide range and you are in the big blind,
it is usually best to check unless you think the limper will concede the pot to a preflop raise or
to a preflop raise plus a flop continuation bet. If your opponents routinely let you see a free flop
from the big blind, you don‚Äôt want to do anything to discourage that. For this reason, I tend not
to get too out of line versus limpers from the big blind.
If you happen to face a weak limper and you check from the big blind, your postflop play
depends on your opponent‚Äôs strategy. You will find that most weak limpers will simply bet
when they have something and check when they have nothing. When you miss the flop against
this type of player, check and see what develops. If your opponent also checks, you should
usually bet the turn and the river, hopefully making your opponent think you have top pair. If
your opponent will blindly bet the flop with his entire range because he assumes that when you
check you must be weak, consider check-raising when you have any sort of equity.
For example, suppose one of these players limps and you check in the big blind with K -5 or
T-9. The flop comes J -7 -4 . Notice that both of these hands have a decent amount of equity
but not quite enough to justify check-calling. You check and your opponent bets $3 into the $5
pot. This is an excellent spot to check-raise to $9. This applies significant pressure and will
usually force your opponent to fold unless he has top pair, which he should rarely have if he
continuation bets with almost his entire range when checked to. If he calls your check-raise and
you do not improve to a hand that beats top pair or you do not drastically improve the quality
of your draw on the turn, you should usually give up. Be aware that some players are willing to
call a flop check-raise with an overly wide range, such as any pair, any draw, Ace high or
overcards. Against these players, check-raising the flop is not the ideal strategy unless you plan
to continue firing on the turn and river. Lots of amateurs have an arbitrary rule in their head
not to lose a lot of money in a limped pot. If you can find players who will fold most of their
range on the turn or river to a reasonable amount of aggression, you will scoop up way more
than your fair share of these pots.
When facing one limper from early position who has a tight range and you are also in early
position, you should only raise with your premium hands. This is because the initial limper‚Äôs
hand is usually strong and when it isn‚Äôt, you have to worry about everyone else at the table
waking up with a premium holding. You should call with your drawing hands, as you stand to
win a decent pot when you connect well with the flop. With your marginal hands, such as A-9
and K-T, you should fold because you are too likely to be dominated.
With your good, but non-nut hands, such as A-J and K-Q, you should vary your play based on
how tight you think the limper is. If you expect him to limp with only premium hands, you
should limp along. If you expect him to limp with a reasonably wide range including premium
hands, pairs, big cards, and suited connectors, you should raise for value. Your play should
typically vary the most when you have borderline situations. This is where adjusting your
strategy based on your reads becomes vital.
It is worth mentioning that some players will limp with a snug range and when they get raised,
they reraise with their nut hands and call with their non-nut hands. These are the prime players
to raise with hands like A-T and K-J because they will reraise when you are crushed and call
when they are crushed. By making a reasonable raise, perhaps to $8 preflop over their $2 limp,
you will get accurate information and also have a good chance to play a bloated pot in position
when you have your opponent dominated. Of course, when you are limp-reraised by this type
of opponent when holding hands like A-T and K-J, you should fold.
When facing one limper from early position who has a tight range and you are in middle or late
position, you should continue to play as if you were in early position. The limper‚Äôs strategy is
the main factor that determines your play. If your opponent frequently has a strong hand, there
is no point in getting out of line.
When facing one limper from early position who has a tight range and you are in the small or
big blind, you should be happy to see a cheap flop with all decent hands. Especially when you
are out of position against a strong range, you only want to raise when you have your opponent
in bad shape. Do not be afraid to play a cheap flop out of position, even with a hand that is
normally strong, such as A-J. Having a ‚Äústrong‚Äù hand is not a good enough reason to raise. I
recognize I am suggesting you play overly tight when facing a tight limper. You must also
constantly quantify your opponents, so you can adjust your strategy if it becomes clear that
they have a limping range that is reasonably wide. If you play as if one of your opponents is a
tight limper whereas in reality he is a loose limper, you will leave significant money on the
table.

### TOPIC: When facing a limper from middle or late position
When facing one limper from middle or late position who has a wide range and you are also in
middle or late position, you should tend to raise with all your playable hands and some of your
junky hands in order to either get the pot heads-up or to steal the pot preflop. Hands such as
A-A, 2-2, A-Q, A-3, K-T, K-5, Q-J, Q-9, and suited connectors should all be raised. Notice this
range is quite wide. You must actively be aware of your image so you don‚Äôt induce your
opponents to make intelligent adjustments. If you have been abusing your opponent a lot
recently and he is getting fed up, pass on a spot to raise as a steal with a marginal hand. If you
have not raised as a steal in a while, or at all, strongly consider doing it.
When facing one limper from middle or late position who has a wide range and you are in the
small or big blind, it is usually best to see a cheap flop with all of your non-premium hands.
With your best hands, you should still raise for value. Of course, if you think you can make a
sizable raise or a raise plus a continuation bet as a bluff and steal the pot a huge portion of the
time, feel free to attempt that bluff.
When facing one limper from middle or late position who has a tight range and you are also in
middle or late position, you should be a bit more willing to raise with your high card hands,
such as A-T and K-J, because your opponent‚Äôs range is probably wider compared to when he
limps from early position. Raising to play a bloated heads-up pot in position will tend to work in
your favor. Granted, unless your opponent will frequently fold to your preflop raise or your
preflop raise plus continuation bet, it is probably not a good idea to raise with blocker hands,
A-x and K-x.
As when the limper is in early position, when facing one limper from middle or late position
who has a tight range, you should be content to see a cheap flop from the small or big blind.
You want to play big pots in position and small pots out of position.
Even against only one limper, there is a lot to consider. You should be constantly assessing your
opponent‚Äôs limping range, his strategy when faced with aggression, your position, and your
image. If you are keenly aware of these factors, you will be able to approach each situation
intelligently.

### TOPIC: When there are multiple limpers
When multiple players limp, your main concern should be the strategy of the initial limper, just
like when you are facing a raise and multiple callers. This is because most players tend to raise
with their premium and reasonably strong hands when someone limps in front of them. This
should lead you to assume the additional limpers have weak ranges. Although, some players
limp with their entire range whenever possible. They happily limp behind with hands like J-J or
A-K, hoping to flop well before investing significant money. This section will assume the initial
limper, as well as the other limpers, have weak ranges. If they have premium ranges, you
should play in a cautious manner, namely raising with your premium hands, limping your
decent high card hands and drawing hands, and folding everything else. Remember, if
someone‚Äôs range is abnormally strong, there is no need to get out of line.
With your premium hands, you should raise for value. Even if you know the initial limper has a
strong range, you should raise with your best hands. As the limpers become more prone to
have wide ranges, your value range should widen. If a strong limper limps from first position
and three people call, you should not raise T-T and A-Q if you expect to frequently get reraised.
If you expect most of your opponents to limp and then call your raise with a wide range of
junky hands, you can raise hands as weak as 7-7, A-T, and K-J for value.
As discussed earlier, you should experiment with adjusting your bet size to get the result you
desire. If you want everyone to fold, raise large, and if you want them to call, raise to a bit less
than the size of the pot. Remember, to figure out the amount of a pot sized raise, multiply the
last bet by three then add any additional money that is in the pot. So, if four players limp and
you want to raise the size of the pot from the button, make it $2(3) + $3 + $2 + $2 + $2= $15. In
general, if you want your opponents to fold, raise a touch larger, and if you want them to call,
raise a bit smaller.
With your marginal high card hands, such as Q-J and J-T, feel free to limp along. As long as you
play well after the flop and do not overplay top pair with a marginal kicker, these hands are
quite profitable to limp. As your hand gets weaker, such as when you have Q-9, J-8, or T-9, you
must proceed with a bit more caution because the hands you are likely to flop will be weaker. If
your opponents are overly weak, you can limp along with these hands, but in order to do so,
you have to expect to have a sizable postflop edge.
Be more willing to see flops with all drawing hands, even those as weak as K-2s and 8-5s, but
realize that all draws are not created equal after the flop. For example, if four people limp and
you limp along with 8 -5 , if the flop comes K -9 -4 , the initial limper bets, and all the
other limpers call, unless they are known to call with all sorts of junk, you should strongly
consider folding. This is because it is too likely that someone has a better flush draw than you.
While folding a flush draw on the flop may seem a bit premature, it will allow you to sidestep a
huge reverse implied odds situation. Notice if you make your flush on the turn and your
opponents all have top pair and worse, which will frequently be the case, they will check-fold. If
someone else has a larger flush, they will bet and you will be handcuffed into calling down. This
is not a situation you want to be in.
Some players love to raise small over multiple limpers when they have drawing hands, thinking
that if they connect well with the flop, they will be able to easily get their stacks in. I do not like
this play because you will occasionally get limp-reraised, forcing you to fold a strong drawing
hand. Also, there is no need to build the size of the pot preflop because it is usually not too
difficult to play a significant pot when you flop a premium hand due to most players‚Äô
unwillingness to fold top pair. You should be content to see a cheap flop when you have a
drawing hand.
As more players limp, you should become more willing to raise with blocker hands, A-x and K-x,
assuming the initial limper is weak and the other players are not known to limp behind with
premium hands. Raising with a blocker against multiple opponents is a strong play because you
can justify making a large raise relative to the size of the pot, and unless your opponents have
strong hands, they will probably fold. However, if your opponents rarely fold to large preflop
raises, you should take this play out of your arsenal because it will frequently fail. If you raise
with blockers and one person calls, you should make a roughly 35% pot continuation bet on
most flops. This will usually result in your opponent playing in a straightforward manner
because most players will think you are ‚Äúobviously‚Äù trying to get action, based on your small
bet size. If multiple limpers call your preflop raise and you miss the flop, you should check-fold
unless the board is very dry, such as A-7-2 or K-8-4. In that situation, if it is checked to you, you
can make a relatively small bet.
If you hit top pair when you raise the limpers with blockers, you should usually go into pot
control mode (checking with the intention of getting to showdown cheaply). This is because it is
reasonably likely that if a lot of money goes in the pot after the flop, your opponent will have
your top pair, bad kicker beat. Suppose you raise with A-2 over multiple limpers and your
opponents have some combination of 8-8, 7-7, A-J, K-Q, Q-9, and 9-8. The flop comes A-7-4.
When your opponents have nothing, they will be drawing thin, meaning you don‚Äôt mind if they
see a free turn. When they have you crushed, they will never fold. This is an ideal time to try to
see a cheap showdown. There is no need to bet for value or protection when your opponents
are either drawing thin or have hands that crush you, which they will never fold.

### TOPIC: Limp-reraising
It is quite common to see players limp and then reraise in small stakes cash games. These
players usually have either very tight or very wide ranges. Some players limp with a wide range
and then reraise with their best hands and call with their marginal hands. More maniacal
players limp-reraise with their premium hands and sporadic bluffs. If you expect your opponent
to only limp-reraise with his best hands, you should continue with a very snug range when he
limp-reraises. For example, if you think your opponent only limp-reraises with A-A, K-K, Q-Q,
and A-K, when you get limp-reraised, assuming the raise size is large enough that it makes
calling with drawing hands unprofitable, you should only continue with A-A and K-K. Do not fall
into the trap of paying off these blatantly straightforward opponents with Q-Q, J-J, A-K or
worse.
When the limper is known to limp-reraise with all of his premium hands and some bluffs, you
are in a significantly more difficult situation. The main problem you will run into is that if you
reraise the limp-reraiser, he will only continue with his best value hands. This should lead you
to call the limp-reraise with your entire range that is profitable to play. Your calling range
depends on how wide you think your opponent is limp-reraising and how you expect him to
proceed after the flop. As the limp-reraiser‚Äôs range gets wider, meaning he has more bluffs or
overvalued marginal hands in his range, your calling range should also widen. After the flop,
assuming your opponent will continuation bet his entire range, you should tend to call with all
of your top pair or better hands and proceed to the turn. From there, you will often face a
decision for your stack, but if you have a rough idea of your opponent‚Äôs strategy, you can make
sound decisions.
Suppose one of these players limps from early position, four other players limp, and you raise
to $15 with T-T from the button. The initial limper reraises to $40. At this point, if you were to
go all-in, your opponent would call with A-A, K-K, Q-Q, and A-K. Against this range before the
flop you only have 36% equity, so getting all-in is a horrible result. However, if your opponent is
limp-reraising with various trash hands, such as A-4 and 8-7, folding would be criminal. It should
be clear that if your opponent is reraising with every A-x combination, he will have way too
many bluffs in his range. If he only limp-reraises with his premium hands and exactly A-6, you
should be fine with letting his bluffs succeed because he will be bluffing infrequently. In my
experience, most players either limp-reraise with only the nuts or with a range much too
heavily weighted towards bluffs. It is also important to figure out which hands your opponent
will turn into limp-reraise bluffs. The boards you can continue on change drastically based on
the hands in your opponent‚Äôs bluffing range. To complicate things further, some players
limp-reraise with all hands they perceive as ‚Äústrong‚Äù. This is often a range of 9-9+ and all
Broadway hands.
In general, if your opponent has too many bluffs in his range, you should call his $40 limpreraise with your T-T. If the flop contains an Ace, you should usually fold to any additional
pressure because it is too likely that your opponent either has a premium hand or an A-x hand
that improved to top pair. If there are two cards higher than your T-T, such as K-J-x or Q-J-x, you
should also fold to a bet. If there is only one non-Ace overcard to your pair, you should often
resign yourself to calling down. If your opponent‚Äôs limp-reraising range contains too many
bluffs, you simply can‚Äôt fold. One of the benefits of being a loose, aggressive player is that your
opponents must pay you off when you have a premium hand. Luckily, most players will be
nowhere near balanced, allowing you to adjust well to their tendencies.
I want to make it perfectly clear that I think limp-reraising is usually a horrible play. Take the
most standard limp-reraising spot as an example. You pick up A-A in first position and limp.
Four other players limp and the Button makes it $16. You reraise to $60. Everyone folds and
you profit $27. While winning $27 without the risk of being outdrawn may seem like a great
result, you left a huge amount of equity on the table. Imagine instead you raised to $6 from
first position, four players called, then the Button reraised to $24. You could then reraise,
profiting $48 when everyone folds. Or you raise to $6 and four players call. Someone flops top
pair and refuses to fold, giving you his entire stack. That is actually the most common outcome
when you see a multiway flop with A-A. Of course, you will occasionally lose your stack when
someone makes a concealed two pair or hits a set.
Suppose you raise with A -A to $6 from first position and four players call. The flop comes 8
-6 -4 . You bet $20 into the $33 pot. One player calls and another player, known to
generally play in a straightforward manner, raises to $90. You now have a relatively easy fold. If
your opponent has a premium made hand, either a set or two pair, you are drawing thin. If he
has a premium draw, you are flipping. This is a situation you want to avoid. Of course, if your
opponent overvalues any overpair, you should be content to stack off. One of the main skills
you must develop in order to crush small stakes cash games is the ability to get off the hook
when you are clearly beat. You must learn to be disciplined enough to not go broke every time
you get outdrawn. So, learn to play postflop and don‚Äôt be content to win a small pot with A-A
by limp-reraising.
In my opinion, there are two spots where limp-reraising makes sense. The first is when you are
in early position and have a playable hand, such as 3-3, A-4s, or T-9s and want to limp. If
everyone limps and you see a cheap flop, that is an acceptable result. If someone yet to act
raises and you think he has a weak range because he loves to blindly attack the limpers, you
should strongly consider turning these hands into bluffs. If your opponent calls, he will
frequently put you squarely on a premium hand. This will allow you to represent premium
preflop hands and to occasionally improve to a premium postflop hand. This will result in your
opponent making many postflop errors because he will fold too often when you are bluffing
and call too often when you are fortunate enough to flop the nuts.
For example, suppose you limp for $2 with A-4s from early position, three players limp, then an
aggressive player who likes to attack the limpers raises to $16 from late position. You are not
getting the proper implied odds to call, but you should strongly consider reraising. To call his
raise profitably, you want at least 20:1 implied odds with suited Aces and suited connectors,
but you are only getting 14:1, assuming $200 stacks. If you make it $40, your opponent will be
in a miserable situation with all his non-premium hands. If he goes all-in, you can easily fold. If
he calls and you see a heads-up flop, you can continuation bet $32 (into the $88 pot) on most
boards, resulting in you frequently stealing the pot. Always be sure you pick your spots well. If
you attempt this play against someone who actually only raises limpers with a premium range,
you will light your stack on fire.
Another time to limp-reraise is when a few people limp and you realize someone yet to act
plans to raise, based on your knowledge of the players or a physical tell. When that is the case,
if you have a premium hand, you should limp where you would normally raise. This will result in
a raise by the player yet to act. Quite often, all of the limpers will call, allowing you to then
reraise, locking up a huge amount of dead money while also appearing as if you are trying to
take advantage of the situation with a marginal hand.
Suppose three players limp and you have K-K. This would normally be an easy raising situation,
but you realize the player behind you is getting ready to raise. So, you limp. The player yet to
act raises to $14. The initial three limpers all call. You can now reraise to $55 or so, putting
everyone in a horrible spot. If everyone folds, you pick up $59 in profit, and if anyone calls, you
certainly have the best hand and can happily proceed to the flop.

### TOPIC: When the limpers don‚Äôt fold to preflop aggression
Some players limp with a wide range and are willing to call huge raises, perhaps as large as $30,
with their entire range. These players will stop at nothing to see a flop with the entire range of
hands they deem playable because they can‚Äôt stand the idea of folding a hand that could have
been the winner. Your strategy against these players is simple: wait for the nuts and then put
your stack in. That being said, most people have some arbitrary amount they feel is too
expensive to see a flop with the vast majority of their non-premium range. For some players,
this is $12, and for others, it is $40. Once you figure out how much someone will reliably call
with their junk, you can tailor your strategy to take advantage of their weakness. When your
limping opponents will call huge raises, you should simply wait for the nuts and then extract
maximum value.
If you can engineer situations where you can make the pot huge when you are in position with
a hand that is likely to be superior, you will crush your opponents. While you normally don‚Äôt
want to invest significant money with hands like A-9 and K-T, if you know that the limpers have
weak ranges (perhaps because they always raise with their strong hands) but will nevertheless
call most raises, you can make a sizable raise in position, then frequently win the pot after the
flop with a continuation bet. While small continuation bets work well against most standard
players, if your opponents are calling stations, you may find that a larger continuation bet is
mandatory to ensure you have fold equity.
With your drawing hands, you should rarely raise because you do not want to bloat the pot
with a hand that thrives in high implied odds situations. When multiple players limp before the
action gets to you, there is almost never a great reason to raise with 2-2, A-3s, or 8-7s. Be glad
that your opponents constantly let you see cheap flops with hands that flop well.

### TOPIC: Abnormal Stack Sizes
As stack sizes change, your strategy should change. This entire preflop section has assumed you
are playing with 100 big blind stacks. When stacks get deeper, which will often happen as the
session progresses, you must realize that hands which can easily improve to the effective nuts,
such as 2-2 and 8-7s, go up in value and hands that are usually one pair, such as J-J and A-K, go
down in value. This is because you usually have large implied odds with your drawing hands and
large reverse implied odds with your high card hands. This does not mean that high card hands
are unplayable. It simply means you must be aware that one pair after the flop is nowhere near
the nuts, as stacks get deep.
As stacks get shorter, big pairs and high cards gain value, and drawing hands lose value. This is
because if you hit your draw, you will not be able to win much money. If you have $60 at $1/$2
and someone raises to $7, you should either fold or go all-in with your small pairs, suited
connectors, and suited Aces. You will simply not flop a strong hand often enough to justify
investing such a high percentage of your stack before the flop. I am sure you see players
misplay this situation on a regular basis. While you should usually fold these hands, you should
go all-in when you expect to have a decent amount of fold equity.
If you are short stacked and a tight player raises from first position, you should fold your
drawing hands, but if a loose, aggressive player raises from late position, you should probably
go all-in. Pushing all-in takes advantage of your hand‚Äôs raw equity and your fold equity. The
formula for figuring out if raising all-in is profitable is: (percent you steal the pot)(size of the
pot) + (percent you get called)((your equity in the pot)(total size of the pot) ‚Äì amount you put in
the pot)).
Suppose a tight player who only raises with premium hands and a few sporadic bluffs raises to
$6 from first position. Everyone folds to you on the button with 8-7s and a $60 stack. Let‚Äôs
assume your opponent will call your all-in 90% of the time. Your equation would be: (.1)($9) +
(.9)((.31)($123) - $60)) = $.90 - $21.87 = a $20.97 loss. Clearly pushing in this situation is a
horrible idea. Notice we didn‚Äôt even account for the times the blinds wake up with a premium
hand, which will be about 4% of the time each. Just so you know, the .31 in the equation is your
equity in the pot (31%) versus your opponent‚Äôs calling range, and was determined using an
online poker equity calculator, such as the free program, Equilab.
Alternatively, you should push if a loose, aggressive player, who you know raises a wide range
when everyone folds to him, raises to $7 from the cutoff and you have 8-7s on the button.
Suppose your opponent raises 70% of hands and will call your all-in with the top 7% of hands.
This means he will call your all-in 10% of the time. Against this range, your 8-7s has 32% equity.
So, you have (.9)($10) + (.1)((.32)($123) - $60)) = $9 - $2.06 = a $6.94 profit. Again, I did not
account for the players in the blinds, but their impact is negligible. As you can see, pushing in
this situation is incredibly profitable, so much so that you can profitably push with any two
cards. When your opponent does not call your all-in often enough, your fold equity will make
almost any short stacked all-in profitable. While pushing in this situation is extremely profitable,
be aware that if you go all-in too often, your opponents will figure out your strategy and adjust.
You must also understand that if you have no fold equity because your opponents will happily
call your all-in with their entire raising range because ‚Äúit is only $60‚Äù, you should wait for a
hand that crushes their range and then get all-in.
For a thorough discussion on how to play with varying stack sizes, I suggest you check out
Secrets of Professional Tournament Poker, Volume 1. Although Secrets is about tournaments,
the strategies discussing play with various stack sizes directly apply to cash games.

### TOPIC: Playing with a straddle
A straddle is a voluntary blind bet, usually two times the size of the big blind, placed by the
player in first position. This effectively acts as a third blind that is twice the size of the big blind.
The player to the left of the Straddle goes first before the flop and the Straddle then has the
option to raise once the action gets back to him. I strongly suggest you never make a traditional
straddle unless it is required in your game, which effectively turns the game into a game with
three blinds. In general, players who voluntarily straddle are trying to increase the amount of
action in a game, or they are simply looking to gamble. It should be clear that making pots large
when you are out of position is not a good idea.
The most important thing to realize is that the straddle cuts the effective stack size in half. $200
is 100 big blinds at $1/$2 but only 50 big blinds at $1/$2/$4. This means you should use a
strategy suited for 50 big blind stacks, assuming you have $200. In general, with that stack size,
big pairs and big cards gain value and drawing hands, such as suited connectors, suited Aces,
and small pairs, lose value. Your bet sizes should be adjusted to account for the larger pot size.
A typical preflop opening raise should be to $12.
One play most aggressive Straddlers have in their arsenal is raising from the straddle when lots
of players limp, and reraising when there is a raise and a lot of callers. For example, at $1/$2/$4
with $200 stacks, someone raises to $14 from early position and four players call. The Straddle
can then either raise large or go all-in, forcing everyone to need a decently strong hand to call.
When facing this type of player in the straddle, strongly consider calling initial raises with your
premium hands (rather than reraising). Against Straddlers who only make this raise over
limpers (notice the raise will not be as large due to there being no preflop raise), you can limp
with your premium hands and then either limp-call or limp-reraise, depending on the size of the
Straddler‚Äôs raise and any additional action before you.
Some casinos allow players to straddle from any position. The person to the left of the straddle
goes first before the flop and then the action proceeds as it typically does after the flop. For
example, if the person in the cutoff straddled, the Button would go first before the flop, then
the Small Blind, the Big Blind, First Position, and so forth. If you are on the button when the
Cutoff straddles, you should either limp or raise with a wide range because you will be in
position against the Straddle, who will probably be aggressive with many hands that are worse
than yours. At the very least, you see a cheap flop in position.
Some casinos offer a Mississippi straddle, which is where the person on the button straddles
and then the Small Blind goes first. Posting a Mississippi straddle with a deep stack is often a
good play because it forces the blinds to be in a horrible spot, since they have to go first preflop
and postflop. Notice the Mississippi straddle will usually result in you seeing a bloated flop in
position, which isn‚Äôt a bad thing. From the blinds when a Mississippi Straddle is posted, you
should usually develop a relatively tight limping strategy because you have a bit of money
already invested and you have to worry about the rest of the table picking up a hand. You also
have to worry about the Button making a sizable raise, forcing you to fold. You should limp with
your playable hands and fold your trashy hands. If you think the Button is frequently going to
raise, as many will, you should just fold hands that don‚Äôt flop well. It is amazing how often
people limp from the blinds only to be blown off their hands by a Straddler‚Äôs raise. Do not set
yourself up to be in a bad situation unless you plan to capitalize on it by limping with a premium
hand in the future.

### TOPIC: Postflop Strategy
While executing a balanced strategy is important in middle and high stakes games, in small
stakes cash games you should try to maximize your value from each and every hand you play.
The concept of balance goes out the window unless you play with the same opponents on a
regular basis. Even then, especially if they are not good at poker, they will not be able to
correlate your exploitative plays to specific types of hands.
Before delving too deep into postflop play, you must realize that hand values are not fixed.
They constantly change based on the number of players in the pot, your opponents‚Äô preflop
ranges, your opponents‚Äô tendencies, your image, the board texture, the effective stack size, and
your hand. You will find that overpairs and top pairs can range from being nearly the nuts to an
obviously beat junk hand.
Two examples will better illustrate this concept. Suppose you raise with A -Q to $6 and a
loose, passive player calls from the button. The flop comes Q -8 -7 . You bet $10 and your
opponent calls. The turn is the (Q -8 -7 )-7 . You bet $22 and your opponent calls. The
river is the (Q -8 -7 -7 )-4 . You bet $50 and your opponent calls with A-8, giving you a
nice pot. In this situation, even though the board got a bit rough by the river, your top pair, top
kicker is a premium hand, assuming your opponent shows no aggression.
Instead, suppose you raise with A -Q to $6 and four players yet to act call. The flop again
comes Q -8 -7 . You bet $20 and three players call. The turn is the (Q -8 -7 )-7 . You
check, one player bets $60, another calls, and another folds. Even though you could still have
the best hand, it is highly probable someone improved to trips. The intelligent play, assuming
your opponents are not blatantly crazy, is to fold.
Notice that the number of players in the pot drastically changed your hand‚Äôs strength even
though nothing else changed. Keep this in mind as we proceed through the postflop section.
Players who crush the games extract maximum value from their marginal made hands while
getting away from normally strong hands once it becomes clear they are beat. Compared to
preflop skills, postflop skills are much more difficult to master, primarily because there are
many more situations that can arise. This section will teach you how to tackle the situations you
find yourself in most often. Realize that learning how to play in common situations will only
take you so far. You must actively put your opponents on ranges in each and every pot you
play. Failure to do so will certainly leave money on the table.
In this section I will first discuss how to play the most common situations heads-up and then
how to play them multiway. Please recognize I am not going too in-depth on any individual
situation. For a thorough treatment of how I approach postflop play, please refer to Jonathan
Little on Live No-Limit Cash Games, Volume 1.

### TOPIC: Heads-Up
On the flop, you will have a premium hand, a decent top pair, a junky middle or bottom pair, a
draw, or trash. While the value of each hand in each category will vary, they can be lumped
together for simplicity.

### TOPIC: When you have a premium hand
With your premium hands, you have to figure out whether or not you fear being outdrawn.
With hands where you do not fear being outdrawn, you have to figure out how likely your
opponent is to have a strong hand. For example, if an overly tight player raises to $6 and you
call on the button with 2-2, if the flop comes 5-2-2, you do not need to fear being outdrawn. If
your opponent bets, it is usually best to slow play even though he probably has a strong hand.
However, if you get the vibe that he has exactly an overpair and will never fold to your
aggression, you should raise to get the money in immediately before a card comes that could
scare him off. If instead, you raise with Q-J, one player in late position calls, and the flop comes
Q-Q-J, it is quite difficult for your opponent to have anything. This should lead you to check,
giving your opponent the opportunity to either bluff or improve to a decent, but still secondbest hand.
When you have the nuts but can easily be outdrawn, you should bet. Slow playing these hands
can lead to disaster. For example, if you raise with 4 -4 and you see a 9 -8 -4 flop
heads-up, you should almost certainly bet. Middle card boards are excellent for the preflop
caller, meaning your opponent should have a much stronger range than you. Obviously in this
exact situation, you have a much stronger hand than normal. You should start by betting with
the intention of checking if the turn is a spade and continuing to bet on most other cards, even
ones that complete the obvious straight draws. Notice that 4-4 is not exactly the nuts, but it is
close enough. You usually do not need to play the nuts and the second nuts differently because
both hands are so strong that you will rarely fold. On 9 -8 -4 , top two pair and better hands
can all be played as the effective nuts.

### TOPIC: When you have a strong one pair hand
With your strong one pair hands, you should usually bet as long as it is likely that your
opponent has a worse hand. Just like when you have the nuts but fear a redraw, it is usually
best to check once your top pair loses a large portion of its value. For example, if you raise and
get one caller with A -J and the flop comes J -T -5 you should certainly bet. If the turn is
a spade, King, or Queen, you should usually check with the intention of calling at least one bet.
If the turn is any other card, you should continue betting an amount that marginal made hands
can realistically call. With top pair, it is mandatory that you choose bet sizes that allow worse
hands to call. In this example, you should usually bet about half of the size of the pot on safe
turn cards because marginal made hands will usually fold to a larger bet.
Another concept you must master if you want to have any chance of winning at small stakes
cash games is that you can bet for value with the intention of folding if you get raised. Say you
raise to $6 with A -J
and see the same J -T -5 flop. You bet $10 and your opponent calls.
The turn is the (J -T -5 )-7 . Even though an obvious straight draw completed, there are
many other draws and marginal made hands your opponent could have. Against typical timid
opposition, you should bet $17 for value. If your opponent calls, you should assume he has
either a worse made hand or a draw. If your opponent raises, you should almost certainly fold,
assuming he improved on the turn to a hand that has you crushed. This strategy works
amazingly well, especially against players who play in a relatively straightforward manner on
the turn and river, which will be almost everyone in the player pool besides the maniacs. If you
bet $17 on the turn and your opponent calls, you should continue betting for value, perhaps
$28, on all safe rivers, again with the intention of folding if you get raised.
It is quite common to see small stakes players, when facing a flop continuation bet, raise when
they make top pair because they want to win the pot immediately. Against all but the worst
calling stations, this is a huge mistake. Almost all of the value from top pair comes from
extracting value from worse made hands, not by raising and picking up a small pot when your
opponent is drawing thin. What often happens is that these players raise with top pair and then
face significant aggression. They are usually unable to fold, resulting in them getting all-in with
top pair versus a hand that has them crushed.
For example, you raise with A-A, 8-8, 7-7, A-K, A-Q, J-T, or 5-4. Someone calls on the button.
The flop comes K-7-4. You make a continuation bet and the Button raises with his K-Q. Notice
that with A-A, 7-7, and A-K, you are never folding. With A-Q, J-T, 8-8, and 5-4, you will fold. Your
opponent‚Äôs raise forces you to play perfectly. This means that when your opponent wins, he
wins a small pot and when he loses, he loses a large pot. Routinely raising the flop with top pair
is one of the main reasons amateur small stakes players consistently lose.
Against opponents who you think might raise the turn with a range wider than only premium
hands that beat top pair, you should often check with the intention of check-calling down on
most boards. Most aggressive players realize that their opponents will continuation bet on
most flops. They also realize that most players will give up on the turn when they have a
marginal or weak hand. Against these aggressive players, a powerful strategy is to check to
them on the turn, inducing them to bluff, while also making it very difficult to get pushed off
your hand by a sizable turn or river raise.
For example, suppose you raise to $6 with K-Js from middle position and a loose, aggressive
player calls from the button. The flop comes K-Q-6. You bet $10 and your opponent calls. The
turn is the (K-Q-6)-9. Notice you could easily be crushed by a straight or two pair. If you bet and
get raised, you will have a tough time withstanding the pressure. This is an excellent spot to
check to induce your opponent to bluff. So, you check and he bets $22. Calling is the only play
that has any merit. Notice if you raise, your opponent will know with a high degree of certainty
that you have a strong hand, which will result in him playing perfectly. Notice that there are
very few bad river cards for you. If you check the river and your opponent bets, you should call.
Even though an Ace bumps you down to middle pair, most aggressive players view an overcard
as a card they simply must bluff. If a Jack comes, you have two pair and your opponent may also
view that as a mandatory bluffing opportunity. Perhaps the worst card for you is a Queen, but
even then, it is likely your opponent is trying to blindly attack your ‚Äúobvious‚Äù weakness. So,
once you check the turn, your plan should be to call down almost every time.

### TOPIC: When you have middle or bottom pair
Middle pair and bottom pair are difficult hands to play because, while they often have a decent
amount of value, if significant money goes in the pot, you are almost always beat. Although top
pair is usually strong enough to value bet against most players, middle and bottom pair are not.
As with top pair, it is important to realize that middle pair can be a reasonably strong value
hand or absolute junk. For example A -Q
is quite weak.
on K -Q -2 is fairly strong, but on K -Q -J , it
You will find that the best strategy with middle pair against most players is to value bet the flop
with the intention of pot controlling on the turn, as you should do against loose, aggressive
players with top pair. This will allow you to see a showdown cheaply with little risk of getting
blown off your hand.
Alternatively, with your weak top pairs and strong middle pairs, checking the flop is a
reasonable strategy, especially if you think your opponent will only call your flop bet with a
strong range consisting of middle pair and better. The purpose of checking is to control the size
of the pot and allow you to see a cheap showdown with what is usually the best hand if
relatively little money goes in the pot. You will find that this situation frequently occurs when
you raise with a big pair and an overcard flops.
Suppose you raise with J-J from middle position to $6 and a somewhat straightforward player
calls from the small blind. You assume his range is mostly non-premium pairs, big cards, and a
few suited connectors. The flop comes Q-6-3. While you probably have the best hand, if you bet
and your opponent calls, he should have a Queen a large percentage of the time. However, if
you check and he checks to you on the turn, you can be much more confident that he doesn‚Äôt
have top pair. Also notice there are very few bad turn cards for you besides an Ace or King. If
your opponent bets the turn after the flop checks through, you should tend to call at least once
versus almost everyone because most players will either attack ‚Äúobvious‚Äù weakness or value
bet too thinly with a hand like 8-8 or 6-5. The combination of these two factors should lead you
to call the turn and often the river, assuming you don‚Äôt have a strong read on your opponent.
Checking the flop minimizes the amount you lose when you are crushed while maximizing the
amount you win when your opponent is drawing thin.

### TOPIC: When you have a drawing hand
Draws tend to come in three types, premium draws, marginal draws, and trashy draws.
Premium draws are flush draws with additional equity, such as a straight draw or overcards.
Marginal draws are naked flush draws, open ended straight draws, and gutshot straight draws
with overcards. Trashy draws are gutshot straight draws with one overcard, naked gutshot
straight draws, and naked overcards. It is important to realize that some draws should be
played as if they are premium hands, while others should routinely be check-folded when you
aren‚Äôt the aggressor. Failure to accurately assess a draw‚Äôs strength is the downfall of many
small stakes poker players.
You should play your premium draws aggressively, assuming your opponent‚Äôs range does not
entirely consist of premium hands. This is because they tend to have roughly 45% equity against
even the strongest ranges. For example, suppose someone raises to $7 and you call with T -9
from the button. The flop comes 8 -7 -3 . Your opponent bets $12. Your optimal play
depends almost entirely on your opponent‚Äôs tendencies. If you think your opponent‚Äôs range is
generally weak, you have excellent options at your disposal. You can raise the flop, or you can
call the flop, either with the intention of betting the turn if your opponent checks or raising the
turn if he continues betting and you miss.
If you think your opponent will only continuation bet with his premium hands, there is little
point in raising because he will rarely fold. While investing significant money in a roughly
neutral spot isn‚Äôt too bad, a much better strategy is to improve to the effective nuts before
piling in your stack, especially if your opponent will pay you off when you hit.
When you are fortunate enough to complete your draw to the effective nuts, you should raise
versus some players and call versus others. In the high stakes games where players are capable
of getting away from strong hands when faced with aggression, raising when you make the
effective nuts is almost always an error. A better play is to continue calling, hopefully inducing
your opponent to think you have a marginal made hand. This is often the best play against the
better players in the small stakes games. Remember back to how I suggested you play top pair,
betting for value until you get raised. If your opponents implement that same strategy, raising
when you improve to the effective nuts is a horrible play because they will fold. However,
against players who are incapable of folding top pair, it is usually best to put in a small turn
raise. Against blatant calling stations who are always ready and willing to get all-in with top
pair, put in a large raise, perhaps even an all-in raise.
Suppose someone raises to $8 and you call with 9 -8 .The flop comes T -7 -3 . Your
calling station opponent bets $14 and you call. The turn is the (T -7 -3 )-K . Your opponent
bets $30. This could be an excellent spot to go all-in if your opponent seems to have a hand he
likes and is unable to fold. If instead, your opponent is capable of making a big fold, assuming
you decided to call the flop instead of raising, you should call the turn, looking to raise or call on
the river, depending on the situation.
Marginal draws are a bit tougher to play because you often have to rely on fold equity in
addition to your actual equity to show a profit, especially if your opponents are good enough
not to pay you off every time you hit. This should lead you to play marginal draws a bit more
aggressively than premium draws, assuming your opponents will often fold to your aggression.
Suppose a tight player who only raises premium pairs and premium big cards raises to $7 from
early position and you call with J -T on the button. The flop comes Q -9 -4 . If your
opponent bets $10, you should almost certainly call because the only hand in your opponents‚Äô
preflop raising range he will fold to a raise is A-K. When he has any other hand, you are in bad
shape. Also notice that your opponent may check the turn when he doesn‚Äôt have top pair or an
overpair, giving you the opportunity to steal the pot.
Now suppose a loose, aggressive player raises from middle position to $7, you call on the
button with J -T , and see the same Q -9 -4 flop. If your opponent bets $10, you should
strongly consider raising to $27 because your opponent‚Äôs range is much weaker, meaning he
will frequently fold to your aggression.
When you complete your marginal draw on the turn and your opponent continues betting, it is
usually best to call unless he is a calling station. Remember, you don‚Äôt want to do anything that
will allow your opponent to drastically narrow your range to entirely premium hands. That
being said, if you have J -T on a Q -9 -4 board and call a continuation bet, if the turn is a
heart and your loose, aggressive opponent continues betting, you should strongly consider
raising as a bluff to represent the flush. You must understand which cards would be great for
you and horrible for your opponent. As long as you are known to be capable of calling, instead
of raising with your drawing hands on the flop, you can easily represent any draw that comes in
on the turn with a raise. Of course, once your opponents figure out you are capable of bluffing
in this spot, you should also raise with your nut hands to keep them guessing.
The concept of maximizing fold equity also applies to your junky draws. Whereas with your
marginal draws you have a reasonable amount of equity, with your weak draws, you have to
rely almost entirely on fold equity. This is because if your opponent has any sort of made hand,
you may have as little as 10% equity. However, this does not mean you must always raise or
fold on the flop with your junky draws.
Suppose someone raises and you call with A -3 on the button. The flop comes J -5 -2 .
Your opponent bets. At this point, you should either raise or call depending on how you expect
your opponent to react. If you expect him to fold immediately when he has nothing, you should
raise. If you expect him to call your flop raise with a wide range, you should call. When you call
your opponent‚Äôs flop bet, you should have a clear idea of how to proceed on various turns. If he
continues betting on the turn and you think he will bet with an overly wide range, you should
raise every time you fail to improve, usually with the intention of checking behind on the river if
you don‚Äôt make a straight. If your opponent will only bet the turn with strong made hands, you
should fold. If that opponent checks, you should bet the turn every time, whether or not you
improve. With draws that are worse, such as 5-4 on 8-7-2, you should usually raise or fold on
the flop because there are so few cards that can come on the turn that you actually want to
see.

### TOPIC: When you have junk
When you have a junky hand, meaning you probably have very little equity, such as with 7-6 on
K-J-3 or A-4 on 9-8-7, if you are the preflop caller and your opponent bets into you, you should
fold almost every time. Unless the board is particularly great for your range and you expect it to
be bad for your opponent‚Äôs range, there is no shame in conceding a tiny pot. However, it is
important to realize that not all junky hands are created equal. K-Q is much better than 4-3 on
J-8-5 and should occasionally be turned into a semi-bluff.
When you have junk as the preflop aggressor in a heads-up pot, you should usually
continuation bet when the board should be good for your range, when the board should be bad
for your opponent‚Äôs range, or when you get the vibe that your opponent missed the flop.
For example, suppose you raise from early position and a player who you know only calls
preflop raises with small pairs, marginal Broadway hands, and suited Aces calls from the button.
You can continuation bet almost all boards because small pairs will fold when big cards flop, big
cards will fold when middle and small cards flop, and the suited Aces will fold when an Ace or
flush draw doesn‚Äôt flop. If instead, your opponent is known to call with suited connectors
because he reraises with all his other playable hands, you should continuation bet all boards
except those containing multiple middle cards because these should connect well with your
opponent‚Äôs range.
Against most opponents, you should check on boards containing three middle cards and also
when you have a marginal made hand, such as top pair with a bad kicker or middle pair. If you
flop a strong hand on a board containing three middle cards, your play should depend entirely
on how you expect your opponent to react. If you think he will attack your ‚Äúobviously‚Äù blind
continuation bet, you can confidently bet, knowing you will get action. If you expect him to
simply fold when he misses, you should consider checking. While checking will occasionally give
away a free card that lets your opponent outdraw you, it will also make you much more difficult
to play against.
Your continuation bet sizing should also depend on how you expect your opponent to react. In
general, as the board contains more draws, you should bet larger. This is mainly because you
want to cut down on the implied odds of the draws. In single raised pots, your continuation
bets should be roughly half of the size of the pot on dry boards, such as K -7 -2 , and 3/4 of
the size of the pot on coordinated boards, such as J -T -5 . In reraised pots, you should size
your bets a bit smaller since you will easily be able to get all-in by the river when using smaller
bets, because the preflop pot is much larger. One of the main benefits of betting large on the
early streets is to let you build a large pot by the river. If the pot is already large because of a
preflop 3-bet, you no longer need to be concerned with building it. Your goal shifts to keeping
your opponent in with all made hands that you crush.
I want to make it perfectly clear that there is nothing wrong with raising A -5
and then
check-folding on J -8 -6 , especially if you get the vibe that your opponent likes his hand.
While continuation betting is a profitable play against most opponents in most situations,
sometimes you are throwing good money after bad.
When you raise preflop, flop nothing, make a continuation bet, and then get called, you have to
figure out if you should fire an additional bluff on the turn. In general, when the board changes
in a way you don‚Äôt think helps your opponent, you should fire again. For example, if you bet 98-3 and your opponent calls, if the turn is an Ace or King, you should bet every time. Notice on
the turn you should have way more top pairs in your range than your opponent. If an obvious
flush or straight card arrives on the turn, you should also consider betting, especially if you
think your opponent will raise on the flop with his draws, meaning most of his flop calling range
is marginal made hands. But if you think your opponent is the type of player who will raise on
draw-heavy flops with his made hands for protection, when he calls your flop bet on drawheavy boards, he probably has a draw, meaning turns that complete the draws are horrible for
you. This same logic applies to when you should bluff the river. If the board changes in a
manner that should be good for you and you think your opponent will fold most of the time,
consider betting again. Bluffing the turn and river is a broad topic that is covered in-depth in
Jonathan Little on Live No-Limit Cash Games. In Volume 2 of that best-selling series, I review
numerous hands where I attempt postflop bluffs, some ending well and some ending in
disaster. As you become a more skilled cash game player, I highly suggest you check it out.

### TOPIC: Additional Tactics
Another common play you see amateur small stakes players make is to lead into the preflop
raiser. You will find that most of these players make this play with marginal made hands in
order to ‚Äúfind out where they are at‚Äù. While a few players will mix up their range such that they
are difficult to play against, meaning they lead with marginal made hands, draws, and premium
hands, once you figure out the leading range of a specific player, you can crush him. For
example, if you know a player always leads with top pair, bad kicker, and middle pair, good
kicker, but folds when raised, you can simply raise him every time he leads. Also notice that
leading with these hands takes them out of his checking range, making his checks much weaker.
If your opponent leads with that same range but never folds to aggression, you can raise for
value whenever you have top pair crushed and call when you are getting the proper odds to
draw.
I strongly suggest you do not have a leading range without having specific reads on your
opponents. For example, some players will always raise when led into. Against these players,
lead with your premium hands then call your opponent‚Äôs raise, inducing him to continue
bluffing on later streets. If your opponent will fold when led into unless he has a premium hand,
you can lead with a wide range of junk. In reality, most players are at least somewhat
unpredictable, meaning you will have a difficult time predicting what they will do in abnormal
situations. Also, leading takes specific hands out of your checking range. I prefer my checking
range to be as strong as possible, especially when I am out of position. The last thing you want
to do is let your opponents know that when you check, you are usually planning to check-fold.
Another situation that frequently occurs in small stakes games is facing a player who will call
any bet, regardless of its size, when he has a hand he thinks is worth playing, but will fold to any
bet when he has nothing. Against these players, at least until they figure out your strategy, you
can bet large when value betting and small when bluffing. This will allow you to extract
maximum value from your strong hands and cheaply bluff with your trash.
One key situation worth addressing is when you find yourself on the river in a sizable pot with a
hand you think has a lot of value. Just because your hand has a lot of value does not mean you
should raise with it every time. In order for a value bet to be profitable, assuming your
opponent will never attempt to bluff you, you must have the best hand at least 50% of the time
when you raise and your opponent calls. Against players who will only call river raises with the
nuts, raising for value with less than the nuts is often a bad idea. Against players who will call
river raises with any made hand, raising the river with a wide range of value hands is ideal.
Suppose someone raises to $7 from middle position and you call with A-Q in the small blind.
The flop comes A-8-6. You check, your opponent bets $10, and you call. The turn is the
(A-8-6)-4. You check, your opponent bets $22, and you call. The river is the (A-8-6-4)-A. You
check and your opponent bets $42. This is a situation where you have either a clear call or a
clear raise. If your opponent only calls a check-raise with a full house, check-raising is a horrible
idea because when you check-raise and get called, you lose. If your opponent calls a check-raise
with any made hand, such as K-8 and better, you should raise because your opponent will call
with a wide range of made hands that you crush.
When choosing a river check-raise size, your opponent‚Äôs tendencies and probable calling range
are your main concerns. If your opponent is prone to calling with a wide range, such as with 9-9
in the previous example, unless your opponent is a blatant calling station who is oblivious to
bet sizing, you should raise somewhat small, perhaps to $89. If your opponent doesn‚Äôt care
about bet sizing and simply thinks he has a hand too good to fold, you should go all-in. If
instead you find yourself in a situation where you have the nuts and you think your opponent
has the second nuts, you should make a large river raise because he will call any raise size.
A common leak of some small stakes players is to always raise huge or always min-raise on the
river. If you blindly choose a specific bet size in every generic spot, you are leaving money on
the table. Always think about your opponent‚Äôs tendencies and the range of hands you are trying
to get value from, then size your bets accordingly. For example, suppose you have K -9 on
an 8 -7 -6 -2 -5 board, giving you the straight flush. If your opponent bet the flop, turn,
and river, you should certainly raise large because he either has the Ace high flush, the lower
straight flush or nothing. Min-raising in this situation would be a disaster because most people
are incapable of making a big fold with the second or third nuts.

### TOPIC: Multiway
The main difference between multiway and heads-up pots is that someone is more likely to
have connected with the flop. While you can usually get away with continuation betting
somewhat blindly in heads-up pots, as more and more people see the flop, you should revert to
playing straightforwardly. For example, if you raise with Q-J and one or two players call, you can
justify continuation betting on K-7-2, but if four to eight players call (as will usually be the case
in the softest games), you should check with the intention of folding to a bet. When you have
nothing in a three-way pot and the flop is coordinated, such as J -T -6 or 7 -6 -4 , you
should usually be content to check-fold. While you should attack heads-up pots aggressively,
you must be more selective in multiway pots.
Advisedly, you should not play blatantly straightforwardly in multiway pots. One prime situation
you should look to attack on a regular basis is when you are in position and everyone checks to
you, especially when you are not the preflop aggressor. Suppose a straightforward player raises
to $6 from second position, a passive player calls in middle position, you call on the button with
K-J, and the Big Blind calls. The flop comes Q-7-4. Everyone checks to you. Most Big Blinds will
check their entire range, meaning you cannot narrow his range very much, other than removing
premium preflop hands because he would have probably reraised preflop with them. The initial
raiser probably missed the flop because he would continuation bet with top pair or better. The
first caller probably missed as well because he would also bet with top pair or better. Both the
preflop raiser and the first caller are ‚Äúcapped‚Äù at having middle pair and worse. This means you
are essentially betting into one player, the Big Blind, who could have anything other than
premium preflop hands. Even though this pot is multiway, you should take a stab, betting about
$15 into the $25 pot. If the Big Blind calls, you should proceed with caution. If one of the other
players calls, you should assume they have, at best, top pair with a marginal kicker, and be
prepared to bluff again on the turn and river. Unless your opponents are blatant calling
stations, you will usually be able to make them fold top pair, bad kicker and worse made hands
by the river. In general, if you have reason to believe most of your opponents in a multiway pot
are not interested, do not be afraid to attack, especially if you could realistically have a strong
hand. While you will occasionally be able to steal multiway pots, most of the time you will have
to rely on your cards.

### TOPIC: When you have a premium hand
When you have a premium hand, it is usually best to simply bet for value, whether or not you
can easily be outdrawn. This is because it is likely one of your opponents has a decently strong
hand you beat. The only time you should consider slow playing is when it is clear that if you bet,
you will only get action from a hand that will pay you off regardless of how you play your hand.
You do not want to slow play when slow playing may let a good, but second best, hand off the
hook.
For example, suppose someone raises from early position, you call with A-J, and six other
people call, including the blinds. The flop comes A-A-J. The blinds and the initial raiser check to
you. Notice if any of the players yet to act have an Ace, they will bet, allowing you to play a
large pot. In this situation, slow playing has some merit. If instead, the same number of players
saw the flop but you were on the button and they checked to you, you should bet because if
you check, someone with an Ace will be able to see the turn with a much smaller pot, making it
difficult for you to play for stacks. All of this being said, slow playing in multiway pots, especially
when you are susceptible to draws, is a costly mistake. Slow playing hands like trips or two pair
is almost always wrong.
When you have a premium hand on the flop, make a bet, and get some callers, if the board
drastically changes on the turn in a way that makes your hand much worse, it is usually ideal to
check and see what develops. If the turn checks through, you should usually continue checking
on the river unless your opponents are calling stations. If the board gets even worse for you,
continue to check.
For example, you raise to $6 with 8 -8 from early position and five players call. The flop
comes 8 -7 -5 . You bet $20 and three players call. If the turn completes an obvious straight
or flush draw, you should check, looking to check-call when you are getting the proper implied
odds to draw to your full house and fold when you aren‚Äôt. This may seem overly tight, but when
numerous players see the turn, some of them will have draws, especially when you have a
premium hand (taking premium cards out of your opponents‚Äô ranges). If the turn is a safe card,
you should continue betting for value, usually about 70% pot.

### TOPIC: When you have a strong one pair hand
Top pair and overpairs are tricky hands to play postflop, but if you listen carefully to what your
opponents tell you, you will be able to fold when you are crushed. As when playing heads-up, if
you bet and get called, you can generally assume you have the best hand, and if you get raised,
especially by reasonably straightforward players, you can assume you are beat. As with your
premium hands, if you see a horrible turn in a multiway pot, check-folding is perfectly
acceptable.

### TOPIC: When you have middle or bottom pair
Middle pair and bottom pair are hands that should be played incredibly cautiously in multiway
pots. It is important to realize that these hands are acceptably playable in three-way pots but
are trash in seven-way pots. Suppose someone raises, three people call, and you call with
9 -8 on the button. The flop comes K -8 -7 . The initial raiser bets and someone calls.
Even though you have middle pair and a backdoor straight draw, assuming the bet is not
abnormally small, you should fold because one of the two players probably has a superior made
hand and the other probably has a draw. This means that some of your outs may not be good.
For example, the 9 is almost certainly a bad card. Occasionally, you will be against K-K or 7-7
and lose a large amount of money when you improve. While most players recognize middle pair
is a drawing hand in this situation, they fail to realize it has huge reverse implied odds. You
want to draw to hands you can confidently continue with versus numerous opponents. Middle
two pair when facing aggression on the turn is not a situation you want to be in.

### TOPIC: When you have a drawing hand
Playing draws is tricky on multiway flops because when someone bets and numerous players
call, some players have made hands and others have draws. If you have a clean draw to the
nuts, such as A -3 or K -Q on J -T -5 , you should be happy to call and see what
develops. If instead you have 4 -3 , you should consider folding to one flop bet if it is clear
that many players will see the turn.
As your draw gets worse in multiway pots, you should consider ditching it early. However, there
are times when you can profitably call with a junky draw, especially when it is to the effective
nuts. Suppose someone raises to $6 from early position, four players call, and you call with
A -4 on the button. The flop comes K -5 -3 . The initial raiser bets $8 and all four players
call. This is a situation where you can justify calling $8 to win $73 with your gutshot. You must
be aware that the 2 is not the ideal card for you. If you improve to top pair when the flush
draw misses and face a turn bet, you should probably call then fold to additional river
aggression. As long as you approach these situations cautiously, they can be profitable.
There are times when you should apply pressure with your draws, especially when it is clear
that most of your opponents have weak ranges. For example, if you flop a draw and everyone,
including the initial raiser, checks to you, you should usually bet the flop with the intention of
betting most turns, assuming you see the turn heads-up. Suppose someone raises, four people
call, and you call with T-7 from the big blind. The flop is 9-8-3. Everyone checks to the Button,
who bets. You should strongly consider check-raising to roughly 2.7 times the Button‚Äôs bet if
you think he is aware he can steal this pot a decent amount of the time. However, if you think
the Button will only bet with a strong hand, perhaps because he is known to be a
straightforward player, you should call and see what develops.

### TOPIC: When you have junk
When you miss the flop in a multiway pot, it is usually best to simply check-fold. While this may
seem quite weak, it is likely that someone else has a decent hand. There is no point in trying to
bluff people off decent hands. A common mistake amateur players make is to raise a hand like
A-K from early position, get multiple callers, and then continuation bet when they fail to
improve to at least top pair on the flop. These players often compound the error by continuing
to bet when they still have nothing on the turn. Do not fall into the trap of vastly overvaluing
strong preflop hands that become weak after the flop.

### TOPIC: When the pot is large
You will find that hand values drastically change as the pot size increases. For example, you
raise A -A to $6 from early position and five players call, including the blinds. The flop comes
9 -8 -4 . The Small Blind leads for $24 and the Big Blind raises all-in. Even though you could
have the best hand, you should typically fold unless your opponents are bonkers. Instead,
suppose someone raises to $6, three people call, you raise to $34 from the button with A -A ,
and they all call. The flop comes 9 -8 -4 . In any reasonable scenario, even though you are
against the four players, you simply cannot fold because the pot is too large. The only time you
should consider folding is when all three players before you push all-in. When you have a
reasonably strong hand in a huge pot, your goal should not be to fold without an excellent
reason.
Be aware not to take this concept too far, especially when you are against someone who has a
strong range. Suppose you raise from early position with A-Js to $6, three players call, and then
a somewhat tight, straightforward player reraises from the button to $30. It should be clear
that folding preflop is a perfectly acceptable play. Instead, you decide to call. The flop comes
A-T-5. Everyone checks to the Button, who bets $80. Even though you have top pair, you should
fold. The only hands in your opponent‚Äôs range you beat are K-K, Q-Q, and J-J, which he may
check behind on the flop. If instead, the preflop reraiser is a blatant maniac, you should either
call or go all-in on the flop because you crush numerous hands in his range, such as A-3, K-Q,
and 8-7. Always be sure to assess your opponent‚Äôs range and adjust accordingly.

### TOPIC: Overbetting
When you see most small stakes players make a huge overbet before the river, they are usually
trying to protect their decently strong made hand. They want to do everything in their power to
ensure they don‚Äôt get outdrawn. When they overbet the river, they know they have the best
hand and want to get full value. As discussed earlier, this strategy is horrible because it forces
their opponents to play well. If you find yourself against one of these players, refuse to pay
them off.
There are some players, especially in 3-bet pots, who will overbet with their unpaired hands,
such as A-K on J-8-4, and bet smaller with their made hands, such as K-K and A-J, on that board.
Against these players, you should be somewhat inclined to call their overbets (which will usually
be all-in due to the preflop 3-bet) with a wide range of paired hands. But clearly this play can
easily backfire if you have the wrong read.
While I generally do not recommend overbetting, there are two main spots where it makes
sense. The first is when you are against someone who refuses to fold, either because he is a
calling station or because you think his range contains almost entirely strong, but second best,
hands. This is a typical spot to make a large overbet: You raise with A -2
from late position
and the Big Blind calls. The flop comes Q -7 -4 . The Big Blind checks, you bet $10, and he
calls. The turn is the (Q -7 -4 )-3 . He checks, you bet $24, and he calls. The river is the (Q
-7 -4 -3 )-K . Your opponent checks. At this point, if your opponent has a Queen or
worse made hand, he will almost certainly fold to any bet. If he has two pair or better, he will
call a reasonably large bet, but he probably won‚Äôt have many two pair hands besides exactly
K-Q in his range. If he has a flush, he will call any bet. This means you should either bet a tiny
amount when you think he has a Queen or worse, or bet a huge amount when you think he has
a flush. Suppose your opponent has a Queen or worse 75% of the time and a flush 25% of the
time. You think he will call a $25 bet with a Queen or worse and a $160 all-in bet with a flush.
To figure out which bet is better, multiply each bet times the percentage of the time that bet
gets called. Notice your opponent may raise the $25 bet with a flush, which we will ignore. He
may not call a $25 bet with his total trash, but we will ignore that too. So, your opponent will
call a $25 bet 100% of the time, meaning this bet size profits $25. When you bet $160, your
opponent will call 25% of the time, meaning this bet profits .25($160) = $40. Even though the
large bet gets called only 25% as often as a small bet, it shows much more profit. Failure to
recognize situations like this will leave a lot of money on the table.
Another time to overbet is when you think your opponent‚Äôs range contains mostly marginal and
weak made hands, which he will fold to a large bet. Suppose you find yourself in the same
situation as the previous example except this time, you think your opponent doesn‚Äôt have a
flush, perhaps because you know he always check-raises the flop with flush draws, you know he
leads the river when he makes a flush, or he makes it clear through his mannerisms that the
river severely diminished his hand‚Äôs value. This is an excellent spot to overbet as a bluff
because, unless your opponent is a calling station, he will fold his entire range. Even if you have
a hand as strong as Q-T, you should consider turning your hand into a bluff because if you bet
small, he is likely to call with all non-flush hands that beat you and only a few hands you beat.
By going all-in, you win the pot every time. Clearly, winning the pot every time is much better
than only winning when you have the best hand. As long as you use this play sparingly, it will
show a huge profit in the long run.

### TOPIC: Other Topics
While you certainly must master the technical side of poker if you want to succeed, there are
many other aspects you can work on that will help take your game to the next level. In fact,
once you progress to the higher levels, where everyone knows how to play their cards
reasonably well, mastery of the non-technical skills is what separates the big winners from the
break-even players.

### TOPIC: Basic Concepts
This section covers the basic terms that are required to understand the advanced strategies
explained throughout this book.

Table Positions
Early Position (EP)
At a 9-handed table (Diagram 1) there are three early positions. If there are fewer players seated
at the table, these are the first positions to be removed.
 UTG (Under the gun) ‚Äì The first player to act pre-flop.
 UTG1 ‚Äì The second player to act pre-flop.
 UTG2 - The third player to act pre-flop.
Middle Position (MP)
 MP or Lojack (LJ) ‚Äì The fourth player to act pre-flop.
 MP1 or Hijack (HJ) ‚Äì The fifth player to act pre-flop.
Late Position (LP)
 Cutoff (CO) ‚Äì The next-to-last player to act on all post-flop betting rounds.
 Button (BN) ‚Äì The last player to act on all post-flop betting rounds.
Blinds
 Small Blind (SB) ‚Äì The next-to-last player to act pre-flop. The first player to act post-flop.
 Big Blind (BB) ‚Äì The last player to act pre-flop. The second player to act post-flop.

Poker Terms
Various terms are used throughout this book in order to discuss poker strategy concisely. While
many of these terms may be familiar to you, some may be new. If you are ever unsure about the
meaning of a sentence due to not understanding the terminology, please refer back to this
section.
Active Players: The players involved in the hand, often referred to as the Hero and the
Villain(s).
Hero: The player from whose perspective the hand is played.
Villains: Any of Hero‚Äôs opponents involved in the hand.
Pre-flop: Any action that occurs before the flop is dealt.
Post-flop: Any action that occurs after the flop has been dealt.
In Position (IP): The player who acts last due to their relation to the dealer/button.
Out of Position (OOP): The player (or players) who do not act last due to their relation to the dealer/button.
Relative Position: A player has positional advantage over another player when he gets to act
after him throughout the hand. For example, in the common situation of BB vs BN, BN gets to
act last on each street for the rest of the hand, so BN is IP and conversely BB is OOP.
First In: Refers to the situation when the action gets to a player and no other player has
previously voluntary entered the pot. For example, if Hero is on the BN and everyone folds
around to him, he has the option to be the first in by either calling or raising.
Stack Size and Stack Depth: Stack depth is always displayed in terms of big blinds.
For example, if a player has 1,000,000 chips and the big blind is 100,000, he only has 10 big blinds (bb).
Effective Stack: The smallest stack size among the active players. In a heads-up pot the
effective stack size determines the maximum amount either player can lose.
Bet-size: Bet-sizes are displayed either in big blinds (for example, Villain bets 2bb, 5bb, 25bb)
or as a fraction of the pot (for example 1/3-pot, 1/2-pot, 2/3-pot).
The Nuts: A poker hand is considered ‚Äúthe nuts‚Äù if it is the strongest possible hand at a specific
moment. For example, AA is the nuts pre-flop. J‚ô£T‚ô£ is the nuts on 9‚ô•8‚ô•7 but is no longer the
nuts if the turn brings another heart, 9, 8, or 7 because stronger hands than a straight are then possible.
Effective Nuts: A poker hand that is not the actual nuts but is strong enough that it should be
played as if it were the nuts. For example, 7‚ô£7‚ô• is the effective nuts on 8‚ô•72.
Speculative Hand: A hand that is unlikely to be best at the moment but can improve to a powerful holding later.
Air: A hand with no showdown value or drawing potential that can only win the pot by bluffing.
Bluff Catcher: A hand that can only beat a bluff.
Pure Bluff: A bet or raise made with a hand that has little or no chance of improving on a later
betting round with the intention of making a better hand fold on the current betting round.
Semi-Bluff: A bet or raise made with a hand that has a decent chance of improving on a later
betting round with the intention of making a better hand fold on the current betting round.
Showdown Value: A poker hand has showdown value if, when compared to Villain‚Äôs range, it
can realistically win at showdown.
Nut Advantage or Nut Threshold: A player has the nut advantage if the effective nut hands
make up a larger portion of his range than the Villain‚Äôs range.
Passive Player: A player who tends to play his strong made hands and bluffs in a more passive
manner than he should.
Aggressive Player: A player who tends to take the betting initiative when given the opportunity.
Regular: A player who regularly shows up in games and is assumed to play well and be
experienced.
Pocket Pair: A starting hand with two cards of the same rank. For example, A‚ô£A, J‚ô†J, or
5‚ô£5‚ô•.
Draw: A player is drawing or on a draw if he has an incomplete hand and needs to improve with an additional card in order to have significant showdown value.
Gutshot or Inside Straight Draw: A draw with four outs to make a straight.
For example, 9-7 on Q-10-6.
Open-Ended Straight Draw (OESD): A draw that has eight outs to make a straight. For example, J9 on QT6.
Broadway: The nut straight, A-T.
K, Q, J, and T are referred to as broadway cards.
Any Two Cards (ATC): Refers to a range containing all possible holdings, often used for
aggressive actions that can be taken regardless of a player‚Äôs holding.
Coin Flip / Race: A situation where both players are all-in and both players have roughly a 50%
chance to win the pot.
Cooler: A situation when two strong hands clash and there is no way for the player with the
weaker hand to fold.
Versus (vs): Another word for ‚Äúagainst‚Äù. For example, Hero‚Äôs AA vs Villain‚Äôs J9.
Toy Game: A simplified game used to model specific aspects of a real game.
Game Abstraction: A game where there are restrictions placed on the players‚Äô strategies
intended to reduce the size and complexity of the game. The main types of abstractions are:
Information Abstraction: A situation where some of the information states are bundled
together. For example, on the flop A‚ô£K‚ô£Q‚ô£, the hands 3‚ô•2‚ô•, 3‚ô†2‚ô† and 32 can be considered
as the same hand for strategic purposes.
Action Abstractions: A situation where some of the actions in the real game are assumed to not
be usable. For example, removing a player‚Äôs strategic option of calling or betting certain
amounts, such as one big blind into a 100 big blind pot, or 100 big blinds into a 1 big blind pot.
Rake: Rake is the commission fee taken by a cardroom running a poker game. Some poker
rooms charge a time-based rake, so each player has to pay a fixed amount per hour that they are
sitting at the table, and other cardrooms charge rake as a percentage of the pot, usually 2.5% to
10% of the pot, depending on the game. There is usually a cap to the amount of money the
casino takes from each pot. For example, in a poker game with 5% rake capped at $5, the
maximum amount the house can take from the pot will be $5 from any pot that is $100 or larger.
Most poker rooms also have the rule that rake is only taken if a flop is dealt, so any action that
finishes without a flop being dealt will not be subject to rake. For example, if MP raises to 2.5bb,
BN 3-bets to 8bb, MP 4-bets to 24bb and everyone else folds, the house won‚Äôt take any money
from the pot because the flop wasn‚Äôt dealt, regardless of how much money went into the pot.
Calling Station: A player who never folds a made hand regardless of the action.

### TOPIC: Player Actions
Call (c): Matching the current bet to continue in the hand.
Limp (l): Entering the pot by calling the minimum bet (1bb).
Raise (r): Increasing the price the other players have to call to enter the pot. Raising is also
known as a 2-bet because the action of posting the big blind is considered as the first bet.
Check (x): The option to pass your turn. Pre-flop, it can only be done from the big blind if no
one else raised. Post-flop, it can be done if you are first to act or if other players have checked to
you.
Voluntary Put Money in the Pot (VPIP): When a player enters the pot by either calling or
raising. Posting the blinds does not count as VPIP because the blinds are forced (not voluntary)
bets.
Raise First In (RFI): When a player is first in and enters the pot by raising. Also referred to as
open raising.
Two-bet (2-bet or 2b): The blinds are considered as the ‚ÄúFirst Bet‚Äù, then the first person to raise
the pot is making a ‚ÄúSecond Bet‚Äù or ‚ÄúTwo Bet‚Äù; RFI is a special case of 2bet when there are no
limpers.
Steal: Raise First In from BN, CO or SB.
Isolate: Raising after someone has entered the pot with the intention of playing heads-up post-
flop vs that player.
Minraise: When a player raises the minimum allowed, which is two times the last bet amount.
Minbet: Making the minimum bet allowed. Post-flop, this is one big blind.
Overbet: Making a bet that is larger than the size of the pot.
Three Bet (3-bet or 3b): Making a re-raise, which is to increase the bet after someone else
raised.
Resteal: 3-betting after someone else steals.
All-in or Push: Betting all of your chips.
Open Shove or Open Jam: Going all-in when no one else has entered the pot before you.
3-bet-Jam, 3-bet-Shove, Reshove, or Rejam: Moving all-in after someone else has already
raised.
Four-bet (4-bet or 4b), 5-bet and any subsequent number of bets: Refers to the number of
bets that have been made during the current betting round.
Cold 4-bet: 4-betting when the player making the 4-bet was not the initial raiser. For example:
UTG opens to 2bb, BN 3-bets to 5bb and the BB cold 4-bets to 12.5bb.
Cold Calling (cc): Calling a single raise when in position, or calling a 3-bet or 4-bet when you
have not previously voluntarily put money in the pot. For example, MP opens to 2bb, CO 3-bets
to 6bb, BN folds and SB cold calls.
Squeeze (sqz): 3-betting after someone raised and someone else called. For example, UTG1
opens to 2bb, CO cold calls, BN squeezes to 9bb.
Continuation Bet (C-bet): Post-flop bet made by the player who was the last aggressor in the
previous betting round.
Donk Bet or Lead Out (DK): When the player who is OOP bets into the aggressor on the
previous betting round, denying the option to C-bet.
Slow Play or Trap: To play a premium holding in a passive manner, hoping to induce a value-
bet from an inferior hand or a bluff.

### TOPIC: Action Lines
A ‚Äúline‚Äù is a specific sequence of betting actions taken by a player.
Limp/Fold (l/f): A player enters the pot by limping (calling the big blind) and then folds to a
raise.
Limp/Raise (l/r): A player enters the pot by limping and then re-raises after someone else raises.
Check/Fold (x/f): A player checks and then folds to an opponent‚Äôs bet.
Check/Call (x/c): A player checks and then calls an opponent‚Äôs bet.
Check/Raise (x/r): A player checks and then raises an opponent‚Äôs bet.
Bet/Bet (b/b): Betting the turn after the opponent called or x/c the flop. Also known as double-
barreling or two-barreling.
Bet/Bet/Bet (b/b/b): Betting the flop, turn, and river after the opponent called or x/c flop and
turn. Also known as triple-barreling.

### TOPIC: Hand Range
When players first start learning to play the game of poker, the first thing they simply must
master is understanding hand values and, as a result, a beginner player only thinks about his own
hand‚Äôs strength. Later, as players become more advanced, they start thinking about their
opponents‚Äô hands as well. Eventually, they get to the point where they don‚Äôt try to put their
opponents on a single hand, but instead assign them a range of possible holdings and work to
narrow that range down based on each of their opponent‚Äôs actions throughout the hand (also
known as hand reading). The best players take this even further and, while thinking about their
opponents range, they also think about their own range and how it fares against their opponents
range, in terms of equity, range polarization, balance, nut advantage and many other concepts
that will be addressed throughout this book.
13√ó13 Hand Grid
The hand grid (Hand Range 1) is a graphical representation of a range. It contains all 169
possible pre-flop hands: 13 pocket pairs (5.88% of all hands) that are located diagonally from top
left to top right, 78 suited hands (23.53% of all hands) located in the upper right half represented
with an ‚Äús‚Äù, and 78 offsuit hands (70.59% of all hands) located in the bottom left half
represented with an ‚Äúo‚Äù.
Example
Game: Live Cash Game
Effective Stack: $200
Players: 9
Blinds: $1/$2 (no ante)
Pre-flop: UTG raises to $10. We have observed this player for a while and our perception is that
he is very tight, opting to only play premium starting hands. We have also noticed that he raises
his stronger hands and calls with medium-strength hands.
 Once a player decides to put money into the pot, they‚Äôve revealed some amount of information
about their range. We can use that information to assign the Villain a starting range of hands.
 Start by asking which hands are consistent with Villain‚Äôs actions, and then add those to the
range one by one.
AA: It is definitely possible for Villain to hold AA at this point, and he would most definitely
want to raise with it (unless he was known to slow play).
KK-99: All pocket pairs between KK and 99 are also likely to be in the Villain‚Äôs raising range.
ATs+: AKs, AQs, AJs, and ATs are also likely to be in Villain‚Äôs raising range.
AJo+, KQs: These are also hands that almost everyone raises from all positions.
In total, these hands make up 7% of all possible hands (Hand Range 2).
 Now consider the next tier of hands the Villain may play from this position, as well as his
possible actions with them.
 ATo, A9s-A2s, KQo, KJo, 88-66, KJs, KTs, QJs, QTs, JTs, T9s, 98s (Hand Range 3), are
all medium strength hands that this particular Villain may not consider good enough to raise but
may be good enough to see a cheap flop. From past experience, you might know this opponent
likes to limp these hands.
 This strategy of raising with the premium hands and limping with medium-strength hands is
not recommended because it is easy to exploit by simply raising when the Villain limps (because
you know their hand can‚Äôt be too strong) and by folding your medium-strength and weak hands
when Villain raises (because you know they have a premium hand). Many Villains may not even
be aware of what their range is in a particular situation but, by paying attention, you can notice
their tendencies and adjust to take advantage of them.
 By splitting his range in this way, Villain also makes his opponent‚Äôs post-flop hand reading a
lot easier. For example, if Villain never raises hands such as T9s or medium pocket pairs then,
after they raise, their opponents will know on a flop like 8‚ô£7‚ô†6 that they can‚Äôt have straights,
sets or two pairs, and that their range will consist only of overpairs and overcards.
Hand Range 2: A Typical 7% Raising Range
 Hand Range 3: A Typical Mixed Raising/Limping Range
 The Villain would be much better-off playing a simpler strategy where they only enter the pot
by raising with all hands they want to play, making them more difficult to read. This is a solid
strategy that will work well from early position (Hand Range 4).
 Hand Range 4: A Typical Early Position Raising Range
 You must be careful about the information you give away after taking certain actions, because
the more information your opponents have about your range, the better decisions they can make.
Professional poker players come to the table with a well thought out plan. They have done the
work off the table and constructed their ranges in such a way that they are not easily exploitable.
Of course, just memorizing a few range charts won‚Äôt make anyone a world-class player but
understanding the ranges in play will help you avoid common mistakes, allowing you to make
better decisions.
Combinatorics
Combinatorics is the practice of breaking down ranges and counting individual combinations
(combos) of hands in order to make better decisions. The formula to find the number of
combinations of k objects you can choose from a set of n objects is as follows (note that in all of
these examples the ‚Äú!‚Äù represents the factorial function, meaning that you must multiply the
number in question by all lower digits, e.g. 6! = 6 √ó 5 √ó 4 √ó 3 √ó 2 √ó 1 = 720):
 Pre-flop there are 169 distinct poker hands but, when we account for suits, the number of
specific two-card poker hand combinations in a 52-card deck is:
Pocket Pairs (PP)
The formula to calculate the number of combinations of PP in a player‚Äôs range is:
 where X is the number of available cards remaining in the deck.
 For any PP, this calculation is:
 The diagonal line in the 13√ó13 hand grid (Hand Range 1) represents PP. There are 13 different
ranks of pairs and 6 different ways to make a PP of any rank, so there are 13 √ó 6 = 78
combinations of pocket pairs.
Unpaired Hands
The formula to calculate the number of combinations for unpaired hands is:
 where X and Y are the number of available cards remaining in the deck for each rank. Take
AK for example. There are four aces in the deck and four kings in the deck, 4 √ó 4 = 16, so there
are 16 combinations of AK (and any other unpaired hand) available.
Suited Hands
Suited hands are represented above the PP diagonal in the 13√ó13 hand grid. There are 78 total
hands above the diagonal and four different suits for each, so there are 78 √ó 4 = 312 total combos
of suited hands.
Offsuit Hands
Offsuit hands are represented below the PP diagonal in the 13√ó13 hand grid. There are 12 ways
to make a non-paired offsuited hand, so there are 78 √ó 12 = 936 total combos of offsuit hands.
Therefore, in total there are 78 + 312 + 936 = 1,326 total different poker hand combos

### TOPIC: Hand Ranges as Combinations
Thinking about hand ranges in terms of combos is much more difficult than ‚Äúputting your
opponent on a single hand‚Äù and requires a lot of practice to become proficient at it, but making
this switch is something all players must do if they want to progress in their poker careers. All
the best players in the world think about situations in terms of ranges and combos, not individual
hands. This process will be difficult and tedious at first, but with practice it will become second
nature.
Example
Game: Live Cash game
Stacks: Hero $1,200, Villain $760
Players: 9
Blinds: $5/$10 (no ante)
Pre-flop: Hero is in the BB with A3.
HJ is a regular. He raises to $25 and everyone folds to Hero, who calls.
 Start by giving HJ a standard HJ opening range of 23% hands. You will rarely know Villain‚Äôs
exact range, so you have to estimate. Hand Range 5 is a reasonable estimate.
 Hand Range 5: A Reasonable Hijack Opening Range
Pre-flop Range Breakdown
Pocket Pairs: Villain‚Äôs range contains all 13 ranks of pocket pairs, and there are 6 combos of
each rank:
Suited Hands: Villain‚Äôs range contains 30 distinct suited hands, and there are 4 suits of each:
Offsuit Hands: Villain‚Äôs range contains 9 distinct offsuit hands, and there are 12 of each:
Total Range
Post-flop Range Breakdown
Now we consider how Villain‚Äôs range breaks down on a specific flop. We will consider the flop
of A‚ô£J‚ô•9‚ô•.
Made Hands
On this flop Villain has a total of 157 combos of made hands, as follows.
Sets (7 Combos)
AA: The A‚ô£ is on the flop, and we block the A (meaning it is in our hand), so the only combo
left is A‚ô†A‚ô•.
JJ/99: Using the pocket pairs formula for JJ:
The J‚ô• is on the flop, so there are only three possible jacks left in Villain‚Äôs range: J‚ô†, J‚ô• and J‚ô£.
The process is exactly the same for 99, so we have a total of:
1 combination of AA, 3 combinations of JJ, and 3 combinations of 99.
Two Pair (10 Combos)
AJ: The A‚ô£ and the J‚ô• are on the flop, we block the A, so there are 2 aces and 3 jacks
remaining.
A9: Villain‚Äôs range doesn‚Äôt have any offsuit A-9. The A‚ô£ and the 9‚ô• are on the flop, so A‚ô£9‚ô£
and A‚ô•9‚ô• are not possible. We block the A, so Villain can‚Äôt have A9, which makes A‚ô†9‚ô† the
only A-9 combo left in Villain‚Äôs range.
J9: Villain‚Äôs range doesn‚Äôt have any offsuit J9. The J‚ô• and the 9‚ô• are on the flop, so there are 3
combos of J9s in Villain‚Äôs range.
Top Pair (38 Combos)
AK: There are 2 aces and 4 kings left:
Do the same process for AQ and AT for a total of total 24 combos.
A8s-A2s: The A‚ô£ is in the flop, and we block the A so there are only 2 suits left for each one of
the 7 different ranks of suited aces: 7 * 2 = 14 combos
Middle Pair (30 Combos)
KJ, QJ: 24 combos (repeat the same process used for top pairs).
JTs, J8s: 6 combos.
Bottom Pair (15 Combos)
K9s, Q9s, T9s, 98s, 97s
Pocket Pair 1/2 (12 Combos)
KK, QQ: Pocket pair 1/2 means pocket pairs between top and middle flop card.
Pocket Pair 2/3 (6 Combos)
TT: Pocket pair 2/3 means pocket pairs between middle and bottom flop card.
Underpair (39 Combos)
33: We have the 3 in our hand so there are only 3 combos left of 33. The other pairs (36
combos) are 88, 77, 66, 55, 44, 22.
Draws
Villain has 72 drawing hands, made up as follows.
Flush Draw: (8 combos)
Straight Flush Draw: 6 combos: K‚ô•Q‚ô•, K‚ô•T‚ô•, Q‚ô•T‚ô•, Q‚ô•8‚ô•, T‚ô•8‚ô•, 8‚ô•7‚ô•
Nut Flush Draw: 0 combos: the nut flush draw is also top pair and it has already been accounted
for when counting the top pairs: A‚ô•K‚ô•, A‚ô•Q‚ô•, A‚ô•T‚ô•, A‚ô•8‚ô•, A‚ô•7‚ô•, A‚ô•6‚ô•, A‚ô•5‚ô•, A‚ô•4‚ô•,
A‚ô•3‚ô•, A‚ô•2‚ô•.
Second Nut Flush Draw: 1 combo: K‚ô•8‚ô•
Other Flush Draws: 1 combo: 7‚ô•6‚ô•
8-Out Straight Draw (18 Combos)
QT: There are 16 combos of QT, but we already accounted for Q‚ô•T‚ô•, so there are only 15
combos left.
T8s: We already accounted for T‚ô•8‚ô•, so there are only 3 combos left.
4-Out Straight Draw (36 Combos)
KQ, KT: There are 16 combinations of each, but we already accounted for K‚ô•Q‚ô• and K‚ô•T‚ô•, for
a total of 30 combinations.
Q8s, 87s: We already accounted for Q‚ô•8‚ô• and 8‚ô•7‚ô•, so there are only 3 suits left of each hand,
for a total of 6 combos.
Air (6 Combos)
Accounting for card removal on the flop (because A, 3, A‚ô£, J‚ô• and 9‚ô• are not available),
Villain‚Äôs range goes from 306 combos to 225 combos, and 219 combos are either a made hand or
a draw, so only 6 combos in Villain range are pure air, these being K‚ô£8‚ô£, K8, K‚ô†8‚ô†, 7‚ô£6‚ô£,
76, 7‚ô†6‚ô†
Full Range Stats
Instead of going through this tedious process by hand each and every time we want to break
down a poker situation, we can use range analysis software such as flopzilla.com or an equity
calculator such as power-equilab.com to get the flop stats effortlessly just by entering the ranges
in play. In this case the range breaks down as follows. Note that the percentages will add up to
more than 100% as some hands fall into two categories.
Set: 3.11%
Two Pair: 4.44%
Top Pair: 16.9%
Mid Pairs: 18.63%
Weak Pair: 26.7%
Flush Draw: 8%
OESD: 8.89%
Gutshot: 17.8%
Air: 2.67%

### TOPIC: Key Metrics
### TOPIC: Pot Odds and Outs
Pot odds represents the ratio between what you stand to gain in a poker hand and what you have
to risk in order to get it. Pot odds are important because, when compared to the probability of
winning the hand, they can help players estimate the profitability of making a call.
 Simply put, pot odds are a reward-to-risk ratio. For example, consider a hypothetical poker
situation where you know Villain holds A‚ô†K‚ô† on A‚ô£8‚ô•7‚ô• and you hold Q‚ô•J‚ô•. The pot is $100,
and Villain goes all-in for another $100.
 You need to decide which line is best, calling or folding. So, how do you know if calling with
your draw is a profitable play?
 First, you need to figure out your pot odds.
 You need to risk $100 to win $200 (Villain bet + starting pot) so pot odds are:
 Pot odds can also be calculated as a percentage using the formula:
 So, in this case:
 This means you need to win at least 33.3% of the time to justify calling, assuming no
abnormal tournament payout or bankroll implications.
 Now to calculate your probability of winning the hand, let‚Äôs introduce the concept of outs.
Outs
An out is any unseen card that if dealt will improve your hand. In the case of Q‚ô•J‚ô•, any heart
will improve us to the best hand because we know Villain has AK with no hearts (unless both
exactly the A‚ô• K‚ô• come on the turn and river).
 There are 13 hearts in the deck, and since we hold the Q‚ô•J‚ô• and the 8‚ô•7‚ô• are on the flop, the
remaining hearts in the deck are: A‚ô•, K‚ô•, T‚ô•, 9‚ô•, 6‚ô•, 5‚ô•, 4‚ô•, 3‚ô•, 2‚ô• for a total of 9 outs. Now
we can use the following formulas to calculate the probability of making our hand based on the
number of outs:
 In the following sections, I will explain each formula in detail, although in this case we are
only interested in the third formula because our opponent is all-in, meaning if we call his bet, we
get to see both the turn and river.
Probability of Catching a Heart on the Turn
A deck of cards contains 52 cards. We know 5 of them, our 2 hole cards and the 3 cards on the
flop. That leaves 47 unknown cards, 9 of which will give us the best hand and 38 will not, so the
ratio of non-flush cards to flush cards is: 38:9 or 4.2:1.
 To convert 4.2:1 to a percentage, simply add the two numbers in the ratio (4.2 and 1) together
and divide 100 by that number:
Probability of Catching a Heart on the River (if Already on the Turn)
A deck of cards contains 52 cards, and we know 6 of them, our 2 hole cards and the 4 cards on
the flop and turn. That leaves 46 unknown cards, 9 of which will give us the best hand and 37
that will not, so the ratio of non-flush cards to flush cards is: 37:9 or 4.1:1.
 Using the same method as before to convert the ratio to a percentage we get:
Probability of Catching at Least One Heart on the Turn or River
 Finally, converting these to a percentage gives:
 Now all we have to do is compare the pot odds to the odds of making our hand. Remember,
the Villain pushed all-in for $100 into a $100 pot (Table 1).
 When using the x:y ratio form (odds against making your hand) the hand odds have to be
lower than the pot odds for the call to be profitable. In this case 2 > 1.86.
 When using the percentage form, the hand odds have to be greater than the pot odds for the
call to be profitable, in this case 35% > 33%.
 A good way to think about this is, ‚ÄúI know I will win 35% of the time and I only need to win
33% of the time. Since 35% is larger than 33%, I have a profitable call.‚Äù
 Here you are getting the right odds, so calling with the flush draw is profitable.
 An easy way mentally to approximate the odds percentage using outs is as follows:
 In our example this works as follows.
 The following table (Table 2) gives the odds for varying numbers of outs.
 The following table (Table 3) identifies the number of outs generated by typical hold‚Äôem scenarios.
Backdoor Draw/Runner-Runner Draw
A backdoor draw is a drawing hand that needs to catch two outs to improve to the best hand. The
probability of completing a backdoor flush draw (BDFD) is given by:
 The probability of completing a backdoor straight draw (BDSTD) with a three-card rundown
such as JT9 is equal to the probability of catching a Q or an 8 on the turn that will generate eight
more outs to complete, plus the probability of catching a K or a 7 on the turn that will generate
four more outs to complete.
 Note that the probability of completing a one-out draw on the turn or river is 4.26%. This
 is almost the same as the probability of completing either of these backdoor draws, so
 having a BDFD or BDSTD on the flop is roughly as valuable as having one extra out.
Further Important Drawing Concepts
The following concepts are also important to keep in mind when considering drawing situations.
 Dead Outs: Dead outs improve your hand to the made hand you are drawing to while at
 the same time improving Villain‚Äôs hand to a hand that beats you. For example, having an
 open-ended straight draw generally means that you have eight outs to improve to the best
 hand. However, if the Villain holds a flush draw, two of your outs will also make the
 Villain a flush. So, in reality, you only have six live outs.
 Drawing Dead: A player is drawing dead when all the outs are dead. So even if Hero‚Äôs
 hand improves, he will still lose to a player who either already has a better hand or will
 improve to a better hand.
 Implied Odds: This refers to how much you may expect to win on future betting rounds
 when you complete your draw.
 Reverse Implied Odds: This refers to how much you may lose on future betting rounds
 in the event that you complete your draw but lose to a better hand.
 Pot Committed: You are pot committed when the pot odds generated by your remaining
 stack are greater than the odds of winning the hand. Thus folding to any bet or raise
 would be an incorrect play.

### TOPIC: Equity (Eq)
Equity is your share of the pot as determined by your current chance of winning or splitting at a
point in the hand. It is how often you would win the pot on average if there were no further
betting and all cards were played out. Equity can be easily obtained using an equity calculator.
 Here are two that you can access for free: pokerstrategy.com/poker-software-tools/equilab-
holdem or propokertools.com/simulations.
 There are various different ways to consider equity as we will now see.
Hand vs Hand Equity
Poker hands cannot be ranked according to strength because each hand‚Äôs strength is relative to
the opponent‚Äôs hand or range of hands.
 Let‚Äôs examine the following three hands using equity and try to decide which one of them is
the strongest: AKo, JTs, or 22 (Table 4).
As we can see, AKo has more equity than JTs, and 22 has more equity than AKo. You would
think that, through logical deduction, 22 must also have more equity than JTs. However, it turns
out that JTs actually has more equity than 22. Therefore there is no way to independently rank
these three hands.
 Even if hand vs hand equity can‚Äôt be used to rank poker hands in a vacuum, it can help us
develop an understanding of the way poker hands match up against each other (Table 5).

Hand vs Range Equity
When playing poker, you will never know for sure what your opponents two hole cards are.
However, you can assign a range of hands based on their actions, and then calculate your equity
against that range.
Example
Game: $100 3-max online Sit & Go
Stacks: BN 30bb, SB 10bb, BB 20bb
Players: 3 (no ante)
Pre-flop: (1.5bb) BN folds. SB is a tight player who goes all-in for 10bb. You are in the BB with
Q‚ô£T‚ô† and have to decide whether to call or fold.
 Using the pot odds formula gives:
 The call will be profitable if your hand can win at least 45% of the time (i.e. has 45% equity).
Since you know Villain is a tight player, you can assign him a tighter range than you would
assign a standard or loose player (Hand Range 6).
Hand Range 6: SB Opening Jamming Range (10bb)
Your hand Q‚ô£T‚ô† does not have enough equity to call vs this range (you will win 43% of the
time but need to win 45% of the time), so you should fold.
Range Versus Range Equity
Range vs range equity is useful in post-flop scenarios where you are concerned about how each
player‚Äôs range gets affected by the community cards.
Example
Game: $109 9-max online MTT
Effective Stack: 40bb
Players: 9 (12.5% ante)
Pre-flop: (2.625bb) Play folds to you in the CO with AA‚ô£ and you raise 2.25bb. Everyone
folds to the BB who is a strong regular. You estimate BB defends vs CO with the following
strategy (Hand Range 7).
 You opened a standard CO range of about 31.2% hands (Hand Range 8).
Hand Range 7: BB defend vs CO 2.25x (40bb)
 ‚Ä¢ 3-bet 9.7% / ‚Ä¢ Call 56.8% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 33.5%
 Hand Range 8: CO (40bb)
 ‚Ä¢ Raise 2.25x: 31.2% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 68.8%
 The equity distribution on various flops of the CO 31.2% range vs BB 56.8% calling range is
as follows (Table 7).
 Comparing range vs range equity, we can see that pre-flop, Hero has the advantage, but the
equity distribution will change depending on the texture of the flop. It is important for Hero to
understand how equities shift on various boards because that has a dramatic effect on the way the
hand will play out. Let‚Äôs consider a specific example with a flop of 8‚ô•7‚ô†5‚ô†.
 According to the equities table, this flop favors the BB. It improved their range equity from
41.5% to 50.33%, making them a tiny favorite. Your overall range equity was reduced from
58.5% to 49.67% which means that, in general, you should play much more cautiously because
BB will have many high equity hands such as straights, sets, two pairs and combo draws. If you
choose to c-bet the flop with a high frequency, the BB can x/r you very effectively. If you choose
to check back the flop, the BB can start betting aggressively on many turns and rivers. Even if
the equity of your actual hand AA‚ô£ is high (70.83%) you should, in general, look to play
passively and check behind with a high frequency of hands that can improve on a variety of
turns, allowing them to easily call bets from the opponent.
 Since AA‚ô£ can call most turn bets and bluff-catch effectively, you check back. Play
continues as follows:
Turn: (6.125bb) 8‚ô•7‚ô†5‚ô†J‚ô• [2 players]
Villain bets the full pot, 6.125bb, Hero calls.
River: (18.375bb) 8‚ô•7‚ô†5‚ô†J‚ô•2‚ô£ [2 players]
Villain moves all-in for 1.7 √ó Pot (31bb). Hero calls. Villain shows T‚ô•3‚ô• for a busted draw.
 In this spot AA‚ô£ is an excellent bluff catcher. All the draws missed and you hold no hearts or
spades in your hand, which makes it a little more likely Villain is bluffing because you do not
block the obvious bluffing hands (flush draws).
 Of course, it is impossible to memorize all possible equity matchups between hands and
ranges, or to make the exact calculations while playing. However, understanding equity is the
key for poker success. You simply must spend some time working with an equity calculator in
order to get familiar with some of the most common situations that you will face on a regular
basis.
 Knowing your own range composition is key, as each hand in your range must be played
 in the most profitable way possible in the context of that range.

### TOPIC: Expected Value (EV)
EV is what you expect to win or lose on average in the long run in a given situation.
Mathematically, EV is the sum of the probability of each possible outcome multiplied by its
payoff.
Where:
%W = How often you win; in other words, your equity in the pot
$W = How much money you can win
%L = How often you lose; in other words, 100% ‚Äì your equity
$R = How much money you have to risk by taking the action
 If the result of this equation is a positive number, the play has a positive expectation
 (+EV) and will win money in the long run.
 If the result of this equation is a negative number, the play has a negative expectation (-
 EV) and will lose money in the long run.
 If the result of this equation is zero, the play has a neutral expectation (0EV) and will
 break even in the long run.
 By definition, the EV of folding is always zero. Once money has been put into the pot it no
longer belongs to you. The EV calculation starts from the point you decide your next action.
Therefore, as folding does not put any more money at risk, the EV of folding is 0.
 EV calculations are very powerful because they dictate how the game should be played. If
players knew the exact EV of each action for every single spot, playing would be trivial as all
they would have to do is always choose the highest EV option.
Example
Game: $100 3-max online Jackpot Sit & Go
Stacks: BN 35bb, SB 15bb, BB 25bb
Players: 3 (no ante)
Pre-flop: (1.5bb) Hero is in the BN with A‚ô†5‚ô†
Hero raises 2x, SB is a regular who goes all-in for 15bb. BB folds and the action gets back to
Hero who has a decision.
 Take your time and analyze the parts of the EV equation one by one.
 Villain is a regular, so you can assign them a standard 20% rejamming range (Hand Range 9).
 Hand Range 9: A Standard SB 20% Rejamming Range vs BN
Using an equity calculator, you will see that your A‚ô†5‚ô† has 43.31% equity vs the SB range. So,
 %W = 43.31%
 You can win the SB stack of 15bb plus the dead money (the big blind plus 2bb that you
raised). So,
 $W = 15+1+2 = 18bb
 The frequency with which you lose the pot is:
 %L = 100% - 43.31% = 56.69%
 The amount you need to call is:
 $R = 13bb
 Putting this all together:
 You decide to call with A‚ô†5‚ô† because it is the higher EV option. When you call, you have an
EV of 0.4 and when you fold, you have an EV of 0.
Win Rate
Another way to visualize EV is in big blinds won or lost per 100 hands (bb/100). Since we are
calculating EV in big blinds, all that is needed is to multiply EV by 100 (EV √ó 100).
 Poker winnings should be measured over the long run. The ability to consistently make better
decisions allows the best players to win in the long run. They take the highest EV action over
and over again.
 As seen in this example, a player who calls every time with A‚ô†5‚ô† will make on average 40 big
blinds per every 100 hands more than a player who always folds.
 Even if 0.4bb might seem like a small reward-to-risk for calling Villain‚Äôs all-in for a big
 portion of your stack, it is these small edges, taken over thousands of hands, that make the
 difference between a world-class player and a rookie. Over the course of a lifetime, these
 edges materialize into hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars.
 Knowing the hand equity vs Villain‚Äôs range can help us predict EV and make better
 decisions.
EV Rescaled
It is often useful to think of EV as a fraction of the pot:
Example
The Pot is $150 and you are given the EV of two different actions, A and B:
 EV(A) = $75
 EV(B) = $100
 The EV rescaled of both actions is:
 Action B captures 17% more of the pot than Action A, making it definitively the better option.

### TOPIC: Fold Equity (FE)
Fold equity represents the extra equity you stand to gain from the likelihood of your opponent
folding to a bet.
Example
Game: $215 Online Tournament
Effective stack: 100bb
Players: 9 (no ante)
Pre-flop: (1.5bb) Hero is in the CO with 87 and raises to 2.2bb. Play folds to the BB who calls
with 33‚ô•.
Flop: (4.9bb) A‚ô†K‚ô†5‚ô£ [2 players]
BB checks. What should Hero do?
 In this example, the BB has 71% equity with the small pair while Hero has 29%. However, if
you bet this flop, you can realistically expect Villain to fold over 75% of the time with their
junky holding. So, using our FE formulas we have:
 However, the term Fold Equity is often used in a less technical sense, simply to refer to the
chance of getting a player to fold.
Example
Game: $109 9-max online MTT
Stacks: BN 35bb, SB 25bb, BB 15bb
Players: 9 (12.5% ante)
Pre-flop: (2.625bb) Hero is in the BB with T5‚ô£
BN raises 2bb. He is an overly aggressive player who plays too many hands but tends to give up
when facing resistance. SB folds, and Hero has a decision.
 Your hand is pretty bad and you would normally just fold it against a regular opponent.
However, you know Villain plays too many hands from the BN. Since a wide range of hands is
more difficult to defend vs re-raises, you suspect Villain might be over-folding (folding too
often) if you move all-in in this spot. So, how much fold equity do you need to go all-in
profitably with T5‚ô£?
 To answer this question, you can use the EV equation making EV = 0 and %Villain Folds =FE
 Now analyze each part of the equation.
 When Villain folds you get to win the entire pot:
 Since you are moving all-in, Villain can no longer re-raise you.
 If you get called, you will play for a total pot of 31.625bb. You are risking an extra 14bb and
estimate T5‚ô£ will have about 31% equity vs the Villain‚Äôs calling range.
 Putting everything together:
 You need at least 47% fold equity to go all-in profitably with T5‚ô£.
 You estimate Villain is opening ~60% hands on the BN (Hand Range 10) and calling the BB
all-in with 28.8% hands (Hand Range 11).
 Hand Range 10: 60% BN Opening Range
BN Calling Frequency:
 Hand Range 11: BN Open vs BB Rejam (15bb)
 ‚Ä¢ Call 48% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 52%
The BN Folding Frequency is:
The minimum fold equity needed is 51% and Hero has 52%. So, moving all-in with T5‚ô£ is a
(barely) profitable play.

### TOPIC: Hand Playability
If there were no betting in poker and players were forced to go all-in every hand, the expected
value for each player would be their hand equity √ó the pot.
Example
In a heads-up gambling game each player has to ante $100 and there is no future betting. Player1
gets dealt 44‚ô† and Player2 gets 9‚ô•8‚ô•.
What is the expected payoff for each player?
The equity of 44‚ô† = 47.26%
The equity of 9‚ô•8‚ô• = 52.74%
 In this toy game both players get to realize 100% of their equity. However, in real poker
games where betting happens across multiple streets, if a player folds before showdown, they
give up equity in the pot which is transferred to the remaining players. This dynamic is known as
equity realization.
Equity Realization (EqR)
Equity realization refers to the fraction of equity that is materialized in EV. Hands that capture a
bigger percentage of the pot than their equity share are said to over-realize their equity. Hands
that capture a smaller percentage of the pot than their equity share are said to under-realize their
equity.
Example
Game: $55 9-max online MTT
Stacks: UTG 50bb, BB 40bb
Players: 9 (12.5% ante)
Pre-flop: (2.625bb) UTG is a regular who raises 2bb. Everyone folds to Hero in the BB with
9‚ô£5 who now has a decision.
 As UTG is a regular, you assume they are opening a standard 16% range (Hand Range 12)
that can easily defend vs 3-bets, so 3-bet bluffing with 9‚ô£5 is out of the question. The decision
is between calling and folding.
 If you were calling for all of your chips, the solution would be to simply compare the pot odds
to your hand equity and call if your hand equity were greater than the pot odds.
 9‚ô£5 equity vs UTG range = 29.5%
 Clearly your hand equity is a lot better than the pot odds. However, as you are not all-in, if you
make the call you will have to play post-flop where different outcomes can occur. Villain can bet
aggressively and sometimes force you to fold the best hand. Villain can make a stronger hand
than yours and you can lose a big pot. You could flop a premium hand but get no action, or even
occasionally stack the Villain. Unfortunately, raw equity (the equity as if you were all-in) does
not account for any of these possibilities.
 Hand Range 12: UTG 16% Opening Range
 How can you know if your call is +EV if you have no idea of the type of situation you will
end up facing?
The equity realization factor tells you how much equity you can expect to realize on average
across all possible scenarios. So, if you know both a hand equity (Eq) and equity realization
factor (EqR), you can calculate the hand expectation for more complex scenarios, including post-
flop play.
 Conversely, if you know the Eq and EV, you can solve the equation for EqR:
 Rescaling EV to %EV:
 Equity realization simplified formula is:
 Calculating the EqR for each poker hand for every single spot is almost impossible, as it
would essentially require having the solution to the entire game of poker. However, there are a
couple ways you can get very good approximations.
 You can use empirical data by taking a sample of millions of hands played in online
 games to compare their equity to the fraction of the pot they capture in every spot.
 You can use modern solvers to obtain the EqR of each hand in various spots and average
 the results.
Equity Realization Heatmaps
The following equity realization heatmaps (Heatmaps 1-4) were generated by Pio Solver. They
show results for situations where the BB is playing a single raised pot against either an EP or the
BN in short stack and mid stack scenarios and they account for a 12.5% ante.
Heatmap 1: Equity Realization (10-20bb) vs EP
Heatmap 2: Equity Realization (10-20bb) vs BN
Heatmap 3: Equity Realization (30-75bb) vs EP
Heatmap 4: Equity Realization (30-75bb) vs BN
 Going back to the example with 95o, input the EqR factor from heatmap number 3 into the EV
equation:
 This shows that calling with 9‚ô£5 has a negative expectation and therefore should be folded
(despite the fact that it has enough raw equity to justify calling).
 Another way to tackle this problem is to start by finding out how much equity the hand 9‚ô£5
needs to realize for the call to break even:
 9‚ô£5 has an EqR factor of 58%, which is 3% lower than the minimum 61%.That means that
even if we have a lot of equity, we just can‚Äôt realize enough of it post-flop to make this call
profitable.

### TOPIC: Elements that Affect Hand Playability
Position
The importance of position is something that almost all poker players understand to at least some
extent. Ever since they began playing, they have been told to avoid playing out of position and
how playing in position is a lot easier, but what they are not told is why having position is so
important.
 When you are in position, you have the advantage of acting last on every street for the rest of
the hand, which means you get to see what you opponent does and can react accordingly. Most
importantly, if your opponent checks to you, you can check behind and are guaranteed a free
card, which makes a huge difference in terms of realizing equity IP compared to OOP. After
checking OOP, you will often face a bet and be forced to fold, denying your equity in the pot.
Hand Strength
If a hand has a lot of raw equity, equity realization becomes less of an issue because high equity
hands are happy, in most circumstances, to play big pots. They also provide a lot of flexibility
because you can either call or raise with them.
 Very low equity hands are also easy to play because, most of the time, the correct play is to
just fold.
 Medium strength hands are the truly difficult ones to play, because they desperately want to
get to showdown or see free cards but struggle to continue if the opponent applies a lot of
pressure.
Hand Suitedness
On average, suited hands realize 16% more equity than offsuit hands due to having access to
both front and backdoor flush draws. This gives them a lot of flexibility to either semi-bluff more
effectively or call bets with higher implied odds.
Hand Connectedness
Offsuit hands with no connectivity, such as Q2o, are among the lowest EqR hands. They are
incredibly difficult to play because they flop either high pairs with no kicker or low pairs and
their drawing capabilities are limited. Therefore, realizing equity with them is quite difficult.
Range Advantage
Having the range vs range equity advantage can help the weaker hands in your range realize their
equity because, if your range is strong compared to your opponent‚Äôs, they simply cannot bet too
aggressively. This allows the weaker hands in your range, that would struggle to withstand a bet,
to see more free cards.
Stack to Pot Ratio (SPR)
SPR is the effective stack size divided by the size of the pot:
 Knowing how big your stack is relative to the pot is crucial. It allows you to plan ahead and
tailor your bet sizes to put yourself in a favorable SPR situation according to the ranges in play.
General SPR Guidelines
 Low SPR (0-5): Hands that can flop made hands such as top pairs and overpairs do better
 in low SPR pots than speculative hands that tend have difficulty realizing their equity due
 to the lack of fold equity and lower implied odds.
 Medium SPR (6-11): The value of top pair type hands becomes demoted and the value of
 speculative hands increases. The equity realization of hands starts to revolve more around
 suitedness and connectedness than high card value.
 High SPR (11+): As stacks get deeper and deeper, more of a hand‚Äôs value comes from its
 potential to make the nuts (nuttiness). Hands such as sets, nut draws, high flushes and
 straights, that offer the possibility of coolering your opponent, increase in value. Single
 pair type hands will struggle to get to showdown in large pots unless they have some sort
 of backup equity.

### TOPIC: Range Morphology
Hand ranges can be categorized according to their equity distribution vs the opponent‚Äôs range.
Linear Range
A linear range is composed of the highest equity hands without gaps in between. Here is an
example (Hand Range 13).
Polarized Range
A polarized range consists of high equity value hands and low equity bluffing hands. A range is
said to be perfectly polarized if it consists of only nuts and bluffs, with no hands in between.
Here is an example (Hand Range 14).
Hand Range 13: Hands with at Least 60% Equity Versus a Random Hand
 Hand Range 14: Hands with Over 65% or Less Than 40% Equity Versus a Random Hand
Depolarized/Condensed Range
A condensed or depolarized range is the opposite of a polar range. It has the top and bottom
hands removed and is comprised of middle equity hands. An example is seen in Hand Range 15.
Capped/Uncapped Range
When a range is missing the strongest hands (the top end), it is said to be capped. Conversely, if
the range has all strong hands in it, it is said to be uncapped.
Example
Game: $215 9-max online MTT
Stacks: BN 25bb, BB 15bb
Players: 9 (12.5% ante)
Pre-flop: (2.625bb) BN raises to 2bb, SB folds and the BB calls.
Flop: (5.625bb) A‚ô•JT‚ô† [2 players]
 On the A‚ô•JT‚ô† flop, the BB range (Hand Range 16) lacks all nut hands such as straights
(KQ), sets (AA, JJ, TT), and most two pairs (AJ-AT), so this range is said to be capped.
Conversely the BN range (Hand Range 17) is uncapped because it has all of those hands in its
range.
Hand Range 15: Hands with Between 40% and 65% Equity Versus a Random Hand
Hand Range 16: A Capped Range
 Hand Range 17: An Uncapped Range
 A condensed range is capped, but a capped range isn‚Äôt necessarily condensed. For example, if
the flop were 5‚ô•43‚ô†, then the big blind range would be condensed but would contain very
strong hands such as straights and two pairs, so it wouldn‚Äôt be capped.
 Caveat: In real poker games, ranges are rarely perfectly polar, perfectly linear, or any
 other precise category. In most situations, they will be a mix of the various range types.


### TOPIC: THE ELEMENTS OF GAME THEORY
### TOPIC: The Core Concepts
The following are important concepts that will be used throughout this book when discussing
game theory.
Game Theory: A whole field of math and science that studies mathematical models of conflict
or cooperation between intelligent, rational decision makers. It can be applied to economics,
military tactics, politics, psychology, biology, computer science, and card games like poker.
Game: Any interaction between multiple people called players in which each player‚Äôs payoff is
affected by the decisions made by others.
Utility: The overall measure of happiness players get from specific outcomes. Higher utility
numbers imply that the outcome is preferred.
Zero-Sum Game: A mathematical representation of a situation in which a participant‚Äôs gain or
loss in utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the other participants. If the total gains
of the participants are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero. (Poker
is a zero-sum game if we neglect rake and ICM [Independent Chip Model] used at tournament
final tables and SNGs; this will be studied later in the book.)
Strategy: A full specification of a player‚Äôs behavior, describing each action a player would take
at every possible decision point throughout the game.
Pure Strategy: A strategy in which the same action is always taken at the same decision point.
Mixed Strategy: A strategy that involves playing more than one pure strategy some frequency
of the time at the same decision point.
Dominant Strategy: When one strategy yields a higher payoff than some other strategy,
regardless of which strategy the other players choose. A strategy is dominated if, regardless of
what any other players do, the strategy earns a player a smaller payoff than some other strategy.
 For two different strategies A and B.
 B strictly dominates A if choosing B always gives a better outcome than choosing A, no
 matter what the other player(s) do.
 B weakly dominates A if there is at least one set of opponents‚Äô actions for which B is
 superior than A, and all other sets of opponents‚Äô actions give B the same payoff as A.
 B is strictly dominated by A if choosing B always gives a worse outcome than choosing
 A, no matter what the other player(s) do.
 B is weakly dominated by A if there is at least one set of opponents‚Äô actions for which B
 gives a worse outcome than A, while all other sets of opponents‚Äô actions give A the same
 payoff as B.
 B and A are intransitive if B neither dominates A, nor is dominated by A. Choosing A is
 better in some cases, while choosing B is better in other cases, depending on the
 opponents‚Äô actions.

### TOPIC: Maximally Exploitative Strategy
A Maximally Exploitative strategy is the most profitable response (set of actions) to an
opponent‚Äôs fixed strategy. To calculate an MES you must know the opponent‚Äôs full strategy. You
can find an MES by finding the most profitable way to play each particular hand individually.
Once that is known, the value of the whole game is the aggregate of the EV of each individual
hand.
 If you figure out the most profitable play with each one of the 1,326 Hold‚Äôem hand
combinations, you have found the MES. Since each hand is always played in the most profitable
way, for a hand to be played in two or more different ways (mixed strategy), the EV of each
action must be the same. Consider the following simplified poker situation.
Example
Game: Heads-Up Sit N‚Äô Go (Players can only push or fold)
BN Stack: 100 chips
BB Stack: 100 chips
Blinds: (5/10)
Pre-flop: BN is playing a strategy where he goes all-in with all of his hands. What is the BB‚Äôs
MES vs the BN?
 Using the pot odds formula:
 BB can call all hands that have at least 45% equity vs Villain‚Äôs range, so BB‚Äôs MES vs BN is
to call 66.21% hands and fold 33.79% (Hand Range 18).
 Hand Range 18: A Calling Range with at Least 45% Equity
 Each hand EV calculation is done independently, so all hands that are +EV calls on their own
are called and all hands that are -EV are folded. There is no such thing as ‚Äúloss leader‚Äù type plays
where one hand is played less profitably than it should for the sake of the whole strategy,
‚Äúbalance‚Äù, or protecting one‚Äôs range. Each hand is either profitable or it is not and should be
played accordingly.
 The aggregate EV of BB‚Äôs MES (calling all +EV hands and folding all -EV hands) weighted
to each hand combinations frequency is 13.77 chips from a 15 chip pot, this being 92% of the pot
(Hand Range 19).
 Hand Range 19: Calculating BB‚Äôs MES
 The aggregate EV of BN‚Äôs exploitative strategy (moving all-in with 100% hands) is: 1.2228
chips from a 15 chip pot, this being 8% of the pot (Hand Range 20).

### TOPIC: Counter Exploitation
MES is calculated vs an opponent‚Äôs fixed strategy, but an adaptive opponent can modify their
strategy to a new strategy that is in turn maximally exploitative vs your own MES, improving
their expectation.
 Hand Range 20: Aggregate EV of BN‚Äôs Exploitative Strategy
Example
Consider the previous example, where the BN played a strategy that consisted of simply going
all-in with all hands for 10bb. The BB‚Äôs MES was to call 66.21% hands and fold the other
33.79% of hands. If the BN knows the BB‚Äôs calling strategy, they can adjust their pushing
strategy to maximally exploit the BB.
 We can find which BN hands are +EV shoves by applying our EV equation to each hand:
 Calculating all hands EV by hand can be very time consuming, so we can also use a push/fold
app like Hold‚Äôem Resources Calculator (HRC) (holdemresources.net).
 Second Iteration: BN counter exploit is to shove 46.61% of hands and fold 53.39% of hands
(Hand Range 21).
 Next, the BB can also change strategy to find the best response vs the new BN strategy.
 Third Iteration: BB best response is to call 30.3% of hands and fold 69.7% of hands (Hand
Range 22).
Hand Range 21: The BN Counter-exploit
 Hand Range 22: BB Best Response
 If this process of both players counter-adjusting continues for a large enough number of
iterations, eventually the players will reach an equilibrium point where neither can improve
upon the strategy they are already playing. At this point it can be said that both players are
maximally exploiting each other. This situation is called Nash Equilibrium.
 It may also occur that the players‚Äô strategies alternate back and forth and never converge to an
equilibrium. In this case, the equilibrium can still be found by making slight changes in the
players‚Äô response. Instead of switching all the way to the best response on each iteration, each
player can adjust their strategy one step at the time in that direction.

### TOPIC: The Nash Equilibrium
In the poker world, GTO (Game Theory Optimal) is often used as a synonym for Nash
Equilibrium.
 Nash Equilibrium is a set of strategies where:
 Players are clairvoyant: each player knows every other player‚Äôs exact strategy.
 All players are maximally exploiting each other simultaneously.
 No player can unilaterally change their strategy to improve their own expectation.
 Equilibrium strategies are maximally exploitative when played vs an unexploitable opponent,
so they inherit all the properties of MES, which are:
 Individual hands are always played in the most profitable way possible, and so GTO play
 never involves playing a hand less profitably than it should be played for the sake of
 balance.
 Strictly dominated strategies cannot be a part of a Nash Equilibrium, as it is irrational for
 any player to use them.
 The only way a hand can be played in more than one way at the equilibrium (mixed
 strategy) is if multiple strategic choices have the same EV.
 The following are Nash Equilibrium solutions (generated with HRC) for the previous example
when playing heads-up with 10bb stacks where pushing and folding are the only options (Hand
Ranges 23 and 24).
Hand Range 23: BN Nash Equilibrium
 Hand Range 24: BB Nash Equilibrium
The value of the push/fold game for both players across the different iterations (Table 9).
 In the push/fold example, if the BB knew that the BN was on the first iteration (where they
would just push with 100% range), BB could improve their EV to 13.77 by applying the MES
strategy of calling 66.21% of hands. But if the BB is wrong about the BN‚Äôs play, or if the BN
outthinks the BB and plays the second iteration strategy (push 46.61%) instead, then BB‚Äôs EV
would actually go down to 8.48. If the BB plays the GTO strategy of calling 37.4% vs a BN
push, their EV is guaranteed to be 10.45, no matter what the BN does.
 One of the main reasons Nash Equilibrium or GTO strategies are powerful is that they
 give you a guaranteed minimum EV. The way they are defined, they assume your opponent
 knows your strategy and that their strategy is the absolute best response to what you are
 doing. This is why GTO strategies are referred to as unexploitable. It is mathematically
 impossible for any opponent to gain an edge on you, meaning you will either break even or
 profit.
 Another advantage of playing the equilibrium strategy is that you don‚Äôt have to try to trick
your opponents by getting into crazy leveling wars. GTO strategies, by definition, don‚Äôt make
specific plays vs specific types of opponents. They assume your opponent will correctly adjust to
whatever you do and thus they focus more on playing solid poker rather than constantly trying to
get inside your opponents‚Äô heads.
 If you play GTO against any opponent who is not perfectly countering your strategy (also
playing GTO), your expectation will be greater than at equilibrium and will increase as your
opponent‚Äôs strategy gets worse. However, equilibrium strategies won‚Äôt earn you as much EV as a
strategy that is perfectly designed to counter the specific mistakes of your opponents. Top
players develop sound baseline GTO strategies so they remain unexploitable vs tough or
unknown opponents, but they also have the ability to take advantage of their opponent‚Äôs leaks by
making exploitative adjustments as they learn more about their opponent‚Äôs play.

### TOPIC: The Indifference Principle
The indifference principle was defined very accurately by Will Tipton in his excellent book
Expert Heads Up No Limit Hold‚Äôem, Volume 1: Optimal and Exploitative Strategies (D&B
Publishing):
 ‚ÄúEquilibrium strategies are, by definition, maximally exploitative strategies when facing
 an opponent who is playing his own GTO strategy ‚Äì in this case, every hand is played as
 profitably as possible. So, the only way a hand can be played in two different ways at the
 equilibrium is if both of those actions have exactly the same EV; that is, if the player is
 indifferent to his choice of actions. This is known as the Indifference Principle: if a player
 plays a mixed strategy with a hand at the equilibrium, then it must be that all of the actions
 he takes with a nonzero frequency have the same EV. This is a powerful statement, because
 it tells us something about the GTO strategy of the player‚Äôs opponent. If a player is
 indifferent between two options, it must be that his opponent is playing in such a way as to a
 make him so.‚Äù
 This principle is intimately connected with the idea of balance. Think back to our previous
example where we know that BN‚Äôs GTO push range is 58.3% of hands. The reason they can‚Äôt go
all-in with a larger percentage of hands is because BB is calling enough so that the BN can‚Äôt
profit with the bottom of their pushing range (43s). If they could push and profit with the bottom
of their range, the BN would just keep profitably adding hands to their pushing range. At the
same time, if the BN was losing money pushing 43s, they would choose not to do so and another
hand would become the new bottom of their range. So, the BB must call the exact amount that
makes the worst hand in BN shoving range break even or, in other words, indifferent to pushing
or folding. Since 43s is indifferent to pushing or folding, it is played with a mixed strategy: 74%-
push, 26%-fold. If the BN pushes 43s more than 74%, BB could exploit by calling more hands,
making 43s a -EV Push.
 At the same time, in equilibrium, the BB can only profitably call 37.4% of hands. The bottom
of their calling range, Q6s, is breaking even and is also played with a mixed strategy: call-39%,
fold-61%. If the BB calls Q6s more than 61% of the time, the BN could exploit by jamming a
little bit tighter, making Q6s a -EV Call.

### TOPIC: The Clairvoyance Toy Game
Consider the following simplified poker situation:
Example
Two Players: P1 and P2
Pot: $100
Effective Stack: $100
Street: River
P1 Range: A‚ô†A‚ô•, Q‚ô£Q
P2 Range: K‚ô£K
Board: 3‚ô†3‚ô•3‚ô£22‚ô†
P1: Out of Position
P2: In Position
Both players are clairvoyant: They both know each other‚Äôs strategy.
What is the value of the game for each player?
 In this set up, P1 has a polarized range. AA represents the nuts and QQ represents air because
it cannot win at showdown against P2‚Äôs condensed range of KK, which is a bluff-catcher.
 What is each player‚Äôs range vs range equity?
 P1 wins the pot half the time when holding AA and loses half the time when holding QQ.
Thus each player‚Äôs equity in this pot is 50%.
 If each player‚Äôs equity is 50%, and the pot is $100, what is the player‚Äôs EV?
 Remember that equity alone does not account for post-flop play so, even if both players have
50% equity, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that they will capture 50% of the pot.
 As we will see after solving this toy game, the EV of P1 is in fact $75 and the EV of P2 is only
$25, even if both players play perfectly!
Eliminating Dominated Strategies
Fold AA vs a bet
AA always wins, so the EV of calling a bet of any size with AA is:
 Folding the nuts is clearly a dominated strategy that should never be used.
Calling a Bet with QQ
 QQ can never win at showdown vs KK. So, the EV of calling a bet of any size with QQ is:
 Calling a bet with a hand that cannot win is a dominated strategy, thus P1 should always fold
QQ to a bet of any size because calling loses whatever the bet amount is
Betting or Raising KK
Since P1 never folds AA and never calls a bet with QQ, betting KK doesn‚Äôt accomplish
anything. Betting loses more money when P1 holds AA, thus betting KK is a dominated strategy
that should never be used.
Checking with AA
We know that P2 never bets with KK, so if P1 checks AA, P2 will just check back and P1 will
never win an extra bet, so P1 should always bet AA.
 After eliminating all dominated strategies, the game can be reduced to the next set of
questions:
 What is the optimal bet-size for P1?
 How often does P1 bluff with QQ?
 How often does P2 call with KK?
 What happens if player‚Äôs positions are reversed?
 P1‚Äôs optimal bet-size is to go all-in. We will demonstrate this later but, for now, let‚Äôs have
P1‚Äôs only bet-size to be all-in.
Ruling Out Pure Strategies
We know that P1 should always bet with AA, but what about QQ? Let‚Äôs analyse.
Pure Strategy A: P1 Bluffs QQ All the Time
P2‚Äôs EV when P1 always bluffs his QQ:
 (P2 wins the pot half the time when P1 is bluffing and loses the pot half the time when P1 hasAA)
We already know that P2‚Äôs EV in this game should be $25, so the P2 strategy of bluffing with
QQ all of the time is suboptimal because it gives P2 a higher payoff ($50) than his real
expectation ($25).
Pure Strategy B: P1 never bluffs QQ
If P1 never bluffs with QQ, P2 has no reason to ever call with KK because he would always lose.
 In that case, P1 would bet his AA and never get called, and whenever he has QQ, the hand will
get checked down and P2‚Äôs KK will win at showdown. With this strategy, P2‚Äôs EV is:
 Again, this line offers P2 a higher payoff than his real expectation.
Player1 Solution
We know that P2 will never bet KK, so the only way P1 can get value with AA is by betting, but
if P1 never bluffs with QQ, calling with KK would be -EV, meaning P2 should always fold. If
P1 always bluffs with QQ, P2‚Äôs call with KK would be +EV, meaning he should always call.
 We need to find P1‚Äôs optimal bluffing frequency so that P2 doesn‚Äôt make money calling with
KK but, at the same time, doesn‚Äôt lose money. In other words, P1 needs to make P2 indifferent to
calling or folding:
 By definition we know that the EV of folding is 0 so,
 Using our EV equation:
For clarity let‚Äôs substitute:
%W = W
%L = 1 ‚Äì W
$W = b + p
$R = b
Where:
b = bet and p = pot
 To be indifferent between calling or folding, P2 has to win with a frequency of:
 This is the exact same number as his pot odds:
 This result shouldn‚Äôt be surprising, as P2 wins the pot with the same frequency as P1 bluffs.
We know that on the river, with no more cards to come, the pot odds simply tell a player how
often a call has to be good for it to break even. So, to make P2 indifferent between calling or
folding, P1 must bluff with a frequency equal to P2 pot odds.
 Now all we need is to do is figure out how often P1 has to bet is QQ so that their betting range
is 67% Value and 33% Bluffs.
Player1 Bluff Frequency
Player1 Value Frequency
Player1 Bluff-to-Value Ratio
 Player1 needs to have 1 bluff for every 2 value combos in their betting range, so should bet his
QQ at a frequency of: 1/2 or 50%.
Player1 Total Frequencies
P1 has AA half the time and bets them 100% of the time:
P1 has QQ half the time and bets them 50% of the time:
Player1 Final EV Numbers
AA EV:
 (The EV of betting AA is $150; this is clearly higher than the EV of checking AA, which is
$100)
QQ EV:
 Then the value of the game for P1 is:
Player2 Solution
We know that P1 always bets with AA, so when they check, they are giving up with QQ. This
means that when P2 sees P1 check, he should check back and win at showdown with KK
because there is no value in betting, as P1 will always fold QQ. To solve the game for P2, all we
need to do is find his strategy and EV when P1 bets.
 If P1 is betting a balanced strategy by bluffing 1/3 of the time (bet AA 100% and QQ 50%)
 P2‚Äôs calling EV is:
 If P1 plays their equilibrium strategy, it doesn‚Äôt matter if P2 calls or folds because the EV of
both actions is 0. That said, P2 still needs to call at some frequency, otherwise P1 could deviate
from the equilibrium to exploit them by bluffing more often.
 For example, if P2 chooses to never call with KK, P1 could start bluffing with QQ 100% of
the time and win the entire pot. If P2 chooses to always call with KK, then P1 could exploit P2
by no longer bluffing QQ.
 We need to find P2‚Äôs optimal calling frequency so P1 doesn‚Äôt make money when bluffing with
QQ but doesn‚Äôt lose money either. In other words, P2 has to make P1 indifferent to bluffing or
checking with QQ.
 We know that P1‚Äôs EV of checking QQ is 0 because he will lose at showdown, so:
 Using our EV formula:
For clarity let‚Äôs substitute:
%P2calls = c
%P2folds = 1 ‚Äì c
EV on fold = p
EV called = ‚Äìb
Where:
b = bet
p = pot
 This number is known as Minimum Defense Frequency (MDF).
 P2 has to call 50% of the time with KK to make P1 indifferent to bluffing or checking with
QQ. Another way to solve this problem is by asking how often P2 has to fold to make P1
indifferent. We can do this by using our EV formula.
For clarity let‚Äôs substitute:
%P2calls = 1 ‚Äì f
%P2folds = f
EV on fold = p
EV called = ‚Äìb
 P2 has to fold KK 50% of the time to make P1 indifferent to bluffing or checking with QQ.
 Notice that this result, b/(b + p), is the same as P1‚Äôs bluff-to-value ratio.
 This number is also known as Alpha. It represents how often a bluff has to work for it to
 break even. In this case if P1‚Äôs bluff with QQ works more than 50% of the time, the bluff
 would be profitable.
 Since folding frequency and calling frequency are complementary numbers, they should add
up to 1. So, if you know one, you can always easily calculate the other.
 P1‚Äôs minimum defense frequency can also be calculated as:
 These two results: Alpha and MDF are key GTO concepts and will be revisited
 throughout this book.
Player2 Final EV Numbers
 Since KK always beats QQ at showdown: P2 EQ vs QQ is 100%
 P1 only checks his QQ 50% of the time, so

Vs $100 Bet: Call KK (50%), Fold KK (50%)
Decision Tree (at Equilibrium)
 We still have two more questions to answer for a complete solution.
What Happens if the Players‚Äô Positions are Reversed?
In a nuts/air vs bluff catcher situation, position doesn‚Äôt matter! If P2 is OOP instead, they still
won‚Äôt ever bet with KK because that is a dominated strategy, and so P2‚Äôs equilibrium strategy
would be to check 100% to P1.
 In position, P1 still wants to bet AA 100% of the time because checking back is a dominated
strategy, and P1 still wants to bluff with QQ at a frequency of b/(b + p).
What is the Optimal Bet-sizing for Player1?
On the river, if P1‚Äôs range is perfectly polar and P2‚Äôs Range is condensed, P1‚Äôs optimal bet-size
is always all-in! As we can see in Table 10, P1‚Äôs EV increases as the bet-size increases. This is
because the bigger the bet-size, the more often P1 can bluff. In this game, P2 only makes money
from the tree branch where P1 checks with QQ, so the less often that branch happens, the less
money P2 will make. Therefore, P1‚Äôs EV is maximized when betting as large as possible. If P1
could bet an infinite amount of money, it would result in the capture of 100% of the pot.

### TOPIC: Minimum Defense Frequency (MDF)
As seen in the Clairvoyance Toy Game, MDF is related to the alpha number:
 The Alpha number is particularly useful when bluffing because it tells you how often a bluff
with 0% equity has to work for us to break even.
Example
Game: Live Multi-table Tournament
Stacks: SB=50bb, BB=20bb
Players: 9 (12.5% ante)
Pre-flop: (2.625bb) Hero is in the SB with 72o and the action gets folded to him, the BB is a
very tight and straightforward player who doesn‚Äôt fight enough for small pots.
 72o is a hand that would normally be folded from the SB vs a strong opponent, but here Hero
thinks BB is only defending ~50.8% hands vs a SB steal (Hand Range 25). You have to
determine if you can profitably attempt to steal the blinds with your weak hand.
 Hand Range 25: A Tight Defending Range from the BB
 We can use the Alpha equation to find out how often the bet has to work to break even if we
raise 2.5bb from the SB:
 If the bet works more than 43% of the time it will show an immediate profit, and in this case
the BB is folding 49.17%.
 You always fold 72o vs a 3-bet, and let‚Äôs also assume you always lose the pot when the BB
calls, which is not true because when called you will still have some equity vs the calling range
(but it is worth looking at the worst-case scenario because, if you can profit then, you will always
profit).
 The steal with 72o yields a profit of 27.4bb/100. This raise is only profitable because Villain
defends the big blind way too tightly, allowing you to exploit by stealing their blind with any two
cards (ATC).
 From the BB‚Äôs perspective the defence should be at a frequency of:
 The BB‚Äôs minimum defense frequency is 57% hands, but the BB‚Äôs GTO solution in this spot
is to defend 82.1% hands (Hand Range 26) which, for many players, sounds crazy. Later in the
book we will study BB defense strategies in depth and understand why this is possible.
 Hand Range 26: BB vs SB (2.5x Raise) 20bb GTO Defense
 ‚Ä¢ 3-bet all-in: 17.9% / ‚Ä¢ Call: 54.3% / ‚Ä¢ Fold: 17.9%
Multiway
The Alpha number tells you how often a bet with a 0% equity hand needs to work for you to
break even. However, if there are several opponents still active after the bet, you need to make a
small adjustment to the formula to find out how often you need each Villain to fold individually
to your bet. You do this as follows.
 Where opponents are the remaining players to act after you.
Example
Game: Online Cash Game
Stacks: BB=99bb, SB=220bb, BN=114bb
Blinds: $1/$2
Players: 6 (no ante)
Pre-flop: (1.5bb) The action gets folded to Hero on the BN. How often do each one of the
players in the blinds fold to a 2.5bb raise for Hero to have a profitable open with any two cards
(ATC)?
 We can start by calculating Alpha:
 In total, Hero needs the raise to work 62.5% of the time to break even. To find out how often
each Villain should fold individually, all you need to do is calculate the square root of Alpha:
 So, if each Villain folds more than 79% of the time to a BN steal, Hero has a profitable raise
with ATC.
 Alpha vs one player is given by
 For three players you calculate: and for four: etc.
 Each player‚Äôs minimum defense frequency can be calculated as:
 In this example, each player should defend at least (1 ‚Äì 0.79) = 21% of the time to stop Hero
from automatically profiting by raising ATC on the BN.
 Let‚Äôs consider a small adjustment to this example. Suppose Hero looks at the HUD (heads-up
display) and the statistics on the Villains are:
 Can Hero profit by raising ATC on the BN vs these two Villains?
 In this case you already know each Villain‚Äôs individual fold vs a BN steal frequency. If each
player was folding at least 79%, solving this example would be trivial since both players would
be folding frequently enough.
 How can you know if Hero can profit by raising ATC on the BN vs these two Villains?
 You can solve this by finding the combined fold to steal frequency of both players:
 Combined, these two players are folding 60% of the time and Alpha is 62.5%, so even though
both players fold to BN steal is very high, Hero doesn‚Äôt have a profitable BN steal with ATC
(assuming Hero has 0% equity when called).
 If you know each player‚Äôs individual folding frequency, you can calculate their combined
folding frequency by multiplying them together.
 Assuming your bluffs have no equity, this formula works for any number of opponents and
even for post-flop situations such as when discussing continuation bets.

### TOPIC: Exploitative Play vs GTO
There are two possible types of exploitation: passive and active. Active exploitation further
breaks down into maximal and minimal.
### TOPIC: Passive Exploitation
Does GTO Play Make Money vs Bad Players?
It should be clear by now that in a heads-up situation, if one player is playing optimally vs a
suboptimal opponent then any deviation the weaker player makes away from GTO to a worse
strategy can never increase their value, but it can cost them value, which will in turn be gained
by the GTO player. This phenomenon is called passive exploitation because the optimal player
does not have to do anything besides play an equilibrium strategy to gain EV from the
suboptimal player. In a sense the weaker player is self-exploiting by playing poorly.
### TOPIC: Active Exploitation
Active exploitation happens whenever a player deviates from their core strategy to further take
advantage of an opponent‚Äôs leak.
 A player who always plays Equilibrium Strategy is called a GTO player.
 A player who employs a Maximally Exploitative Strategy is called a Maximally
 Exploitative Player.
 A player who employs a Minimally Exploitative Strategy is called a Minimally
 Exploitative Player.
 In general, when players talk about an exploitative player they are referring to a maximally
exploitative player.
Maximally Exploitative Strategy (MES)
As explained earlier, MES happens when a player chooses to deviate from equilibrium to a
strategy that maximizes EV vs a Villain‚Äôs suboptimal strategy (obviously, this is only possible if
the Villain isn‚Äôt playing GTO). Consider the following simplified poker situation:
Example
Game: Heads-Up Sit N‚Äô Go (Players can only push or fold)
Effective Stack: 15bb
Blinds: 0.5bb/1bb
Pre-flop: Hero is in the SB. His GTO strategy is to push 45.7% of hands.
 Let‚Äôs imagine eight different types of Villain that Hero might encounter in a heads-up match:
 GTO Player: This player will call a 15bb SB push optimally with a 28.5% range.
 10% Loose Player: This type of Villain is a bit sticky and calls a 15bb SB push with a
 31.4% range.
 25% Loose Player: This type of Villain is a bit stickier and calls a 15bb SB push with a
 35.6% range.
 100% Loose Player: This type of Villain really hates folding and calls a 15bb SB push
 with a 57% range.
 10% Tight Player: This type of Villain is a tighter and calls a 15bb SB push with a
 25.7% range.
 25% Tight Player: This type of Villain is a lot tighter and calls a 15bb SB push with a
 21.4% range.
 50% Tight Player: This type of Villain is a massive nit and calls a 15bb SB push with a
 14.3% range.
 In Table 11, we summarize the SB EV gains of playing GTO and MES vs the various
opponents, as well as Hero‚Äôs potential EV loss if Villain plays GTO, instead of the suboptimal
strategy, or counter-exploits Hero.
 As seen in Table 11, GTO play can‚Äôt lose or win EV vs a GTO player, but it gains EV vs
suboptimal players depending on the severity of their leaks. MES on average gains 6.4bb/100
more than GTO vs suboptimal players but doing so creates a leak that can, on average, be
counter-exploited for -15.62 bb/100.
 Even vs an extremely bad opponent who is calling 2x more often than they should, MES only
captures 6.3bb/100 more than GTO and can be exploited back for -2.5bb/100. If the Villain is
calling 50% tighter than they should, MES does very well, yielding 24.6bb/100 more than GTO,
but can in turn be counter-exploited by -62.4bb/100. Additionally, the strategy shift is extreme as
Hero is now shoving 100% hands instead of 28%, so this exploitative adjustment can easily be
spotted by an observant Villain.
 MES involves a degree of risk, because you are putting yourself in a situation where your
opponent could counter-exploit your new strategy to an even greater margin than you were trying
to exploit them in the first place, if they figure out what you are doing. Also, if you are wrong
with your assessment of Villain‚Äôs play (which is inevitable from time to time) and adjust
incorrectly, you will be the one deviating to a weaker strategy that will in turn lose value. Thus
you must be very careful and have a high degree of certainty in your reads if you are aiming for
maximum exploitation.

### TOPIC: Minimally Exploitative Strategy (MinES)
Let‚Äôs return to the Clairvoyance Toy game solution.
Pot: $100
Stacks: $100
Board: 3‚ô†3‚ô•3‚ô£22‚ô†
Player1: EV $75
AA: Bet $100 (100%), Check (0%)
QQ: Bet $100 (50%), Check (50%)
Player2: EV $25
Vs Check: Check KK (100%)
Vs $100 Bet: Call KK (50%), Fold KK (50%)
 Imagine a variation of this game where Hero is Player1 and Player2 is a Villain who tends to
call slightly loose. Instead of calling 50% with KK, they call 55%.
 If Hero keeps playing GTO strategy, he will not earn any extra EV vs this leak.
AA EV:
QQ EV:
 Then, the value of the game for P1 is:
 This is the same EV as seen previously.
 If Hero implements the maximally exploitative strategy vs this Villain, he should bluff 0% of
the time. If he only value-bets, his EV would be:
 And he never bluffs with QQ, so:
 The MES yields $2.5 per hand more than GTO and so, in theory, Hero should just keep
pounding on Villain. However, from Villain‚Äôs perspective, he has seen Hero bet the river only
50% of the time instead of 75% and, every time he calls, he gets shown AA. Hero‚Äôs assumption
is that Villain is calling slightly looser than he should, not that he is stupid. Even if he is very
slow to catch on, there is no reason to think he won‚Äôt adapt as soon as he realizes that Hero is
never bluffing.
 If Villain counter-exploits Hero by switching to a strategy of always folding to his all-in, his
EV becomes:
 This is 2x more than equilibrium per hand and 10x the amount Hero was exploiting the Villain
for! So, Hero should be able to exploit Villain at least 10 times in a row before he catches on to
Hero‚Äôs strategy and adjusts, otherwise Hero will lose money. If Villain counter-exploits Hero
even 2 out of 10 times, Hero would still lose $30, or -$3/hand, compared to GTO. If the Villain
was particularly slow catching on and allows Hero to keep exploiting him for 45 hands in a row,
and only adjusts for the final 5 hands, then Hero‚Äôs EV over 50 hands would be -$12.5 compared
to simply playing GTO.
 Unless your opponent is completely oblivious to your play, you can‚Äôt expect them to ignore
your betting frequency when you are obviously playing MES and being completely unbalanced.
Assuming they are intelligent and capable of adjusting to your play, how do you take advantage
of their leak in a way that doesn‚Äôt leave you open to massive counter-exploitation?
 You can build their leak into the structure of the game. A perfect poker player‚Äôs utility
function would be equal to their EV, but most players‚Äô decisions get affected by different factors
such as the fear of losing money, looking stupid, or the embarrassment of being bluffed, and
those psychological traits will slightly tilt decisions in one way or another, decreasing a player‚Äôs
EV.
P1 EV:
 Where: C = probability of P2 calling
P2 EV:
Where:
AA% = probability of P1 having AA
QQ% = probability of P1 having QQ
 At equilibrium P1 must be indifferent to betting or checking with QQ:
 P2 should also be indifferent to calling or folding with KK and, as we proved before, P1 will
always bet his AA, so:
 AA% = 1
 Then:
 To build Villain‚Äôs leak into the game, we must see it from Villain‚Äôs perspective. In Villain‚Äôs
mind, folding KK when Hero is bluffing is a -EV play by a margin of X and Hero gains that
extra X when his bluff succeeds:
P1 EV:
P2 EV:
 If we apply the indifference principle one more time we get:
And also:
We know that Villain‚Äôs calling frequency is 55%, so:
Then:
Now that we know X, we can use it to find Hero‚Äôs betting frequency with QQ:
What is Hero‚Äôs EV using the new QQ betting frequency of 45% in the real game where x=0?
The AA EV is still $155, so all we need to do is recalculate QQ [EV]:
Then:
 Of course, the MinES EV gain is not nearly as good as the MES EV gain (Table 12) but the
extra $0.25 per hand, or $25/100 that MinES yields, is unexploitable and there is nothing Villain
can do to prevent you from getting that edge unless he fixes his leak by internally reducing his
value of X.
 MinES can be calculated using modern GTO solvers, and unlike MES you don‚Äôt need to know
Villain‚Äôs entire strategy. All you need is to assume a specific leak, lock that leak in Villain‚Äôs
strategy in the solver (allow Villain to play optimally everywhere else) and try to compensate for
the observed leak later on. This way, the solver will produce an exploitative solution accounting
for the leak but also for the best possible counter-adjustments that Villain can make. By doing so,
you will yield a lower EV than MES while protecting yourself from counter-exploitation. Also,
MinES adjustments are small and more difficult to spot by the Villain, so you can keep
exploiting them far longer before they realize what you are doing if they are even capable of
doing so. Finally, in the event Villain reverts to the real equilibrium, you must do so as well,
otherwise you would start losing EV.
The Two sub-types of MinES
 Reactive MinES: This type of exploitation adjusts your strategy only after you have
 observed the leak happen in the actual hand. For example, if you knew Villain overfolds
 to c-bets, you would c-bet with an equilibrium strategy and then adjust the turn and river
 play to account for a stronger Villain range on the later streets.
 Proactive MinES: This type of exploitation adjusts your strategy even before your
 opponent makes the mistake because you assume beforehand that they will commit the
 mistake. For example, if you knew Villain overfolds to flop c-bets, you can increase your
 c-bet frequency to exploit the leak.
 I recommend using both reactive and proactive MinES. For example, vs a player who
overfolds the flop vs c-bets, you should increase your c-bet frequency and then, if called, adjust
your turn and river play to account for your own range being wider than normal and Villain‚Äôs
range being tighter than normal.
 We will see more practical examples when studying post-flop play.

### TOPIC: GTO in Multi-way Situations
The definition of Nash Equilibrium states that:
 ‚ÄúNo player can unilaterally change his strategy to improve his own expectation.‚Äù
 In any heads-up situation, Nash Equilibrium is very powerful because it means that a player
playing GTO cannot be beaten. It is mathematically impossible even if your opponent knew your
exact strategy. You are guaranteed a certain EV no matter what your opponent does. If you are
playing GTO and your opponent deviates to a weaker strategy, their EV can only go down and,
since poker is a zero sum game, that EV will be gained by you.
 Fortunately, Nash Equilibrium principles are not limited to heads-up poker. They can also be
applied to any poker situation once there are only two players remaining in the pot.
 Let‚Äôs look at some examples of common poker situations that can be considered heads-up
subgames:
 6-max cash game: CO raises, the BN 3-bets, the blinds fold and the action gets back to the
 CO. The only players remaining are BN and CO.
 MTT 9-max: UTG raises and the action folds to the BB. The only players remaining are
 UTG and BB.
 MTT 6-max: HJ raises, BN calls, SB 3-bets, HJ Folds and the action gets back to the BN.
 The only players remaining are SB and BN.
 That‚Äôs great! GTO play guarantees unbeatability in any poker hand from the point where there
are only two players left, but what about situations where there are three or more active players?
 In multi-way situations, the EV loss by one player‚Äôs mistakes are not spread equally among
the other players in the hand. In most situations, some players will be able to capitalize more on
the mistakes than others, depending on many factors such as stack depth and position.
Furthermore, some players might end up losing EV even if they play their equilibrium strategies.
Consider the following:
Example
Game: $100 3-max online Jackpot Sit & Go
Stacks: BN 12bb, SB 12bb, BB 12bb
Players: 3 (no ante)
Pre-flop: (1.5bb) BN push 12 BB, Hero is in the SB.
 The Nash Equilibrium strategy for the BN is to push 32.1% hands. If we introduce a fishy
player to the game who only pushes 16%, we can use a push-fold calculator to get the players‚Äô
change in EV if the blinds continue playing Nash Equilibrium and if they adjust to the MES
(Table 13).
 The fish is deviating to a weaker strategy and, of course, that makes them lose EV, but their
mistake also makes Hero lose EV (-4.5bb/100) if Hero keeps playing GTO. Even if Hero adjusts
to MES, Hero will still lose 3.2bb/100 more compared to when all players are playing Nash
Equilibrium.
 The BB is the biggest winner in this situation as they are capturing all the extra EV. However,
if we consider future games then, on average, Hero will be in the BB as often as in the SB.
Therefore, Hero will also be able to profit from this fishy player‚Äôs leak.
Conclusion
Having a sound GTO core strategy and developing a deep understanding of GTO principles is
the key to beating modern poker and absolutely vital in tough games.
 However, GTO isn‚Äôt meant to replace critical thinking. Regardless of how good any GTO
 strategy might be, players should always be aware of the opposition and be actively
 thinking about every action throughout the hand.
 Even in heads-up pots where playing GTO guarantees unbeatability, players can still make
exploitative adjustments to further capitalize on their opponent‚Äôs mistakes. For multi-way
situations, GTO offers near-unexploitable strategies that can be used as a starting point but are by
no means the final answer and should not be followed blindly. Understanding and incorporating
GTO concepts will improve your strategy and make you a lot tougher to play against, as well as
help you better exploit your opponents‚Äô weaknesses. GTO is a powerful tool in a poker player‚Äôs
arsenal but should not be the only one.
Poker Math Everyone Should Know
Normalizing the size of the pot to 1 and all bets as a fraction of the pot makes calculations easier.
For example, if the pot is $60 and a player bets $20, his bet-size as a fraction of the pot is 1/3-pot
or 0.33 pot (Table 14).
Example
If you bet half-pot with a polarized range on the river, you are giving your opponent 25% odds to
call (3-to-1). Your range should have 75% value-bets and 25% bluffs (3-to-1). Your bet needs to
work 33% (Alpha) of the time to instantly profit. Your opponent must defend 67% (1-Alpha) of
his range to make your zero equity bluffs indifferent.

### TOPIC: THE THEORY OFPRE-FLOP PLAY
Pre-flop ranges are the backbone of fundamentally sound poker. Any time you make a mistake in
a hand, you are introducing systematic error, meaning the error will be carried through and will
affect future decision points. A pre-flop mistake can translate into a flop mistake, a turn mistake
and finally a river mistake. Even if you realize you made a mistake on an earlier street, it can be
difficult to compensate for it later.
### TOPIC: Blinds and Antes
Without the blinds and antes, players would just happily wait to be dealt AA, or if deep enough,
hands that have the correct pot odds/implied odds to beat AA, and nothing more. The blinds
encourage players to fight for the money in the pot, and as a result, play more hands. The reason
players play hands other than AA is because there is money in the pot to be won.
Win Rate
A player‚Äôs skill edge or skill deficit over the player pool can be measured in the number of big
blinds won or lost per 100 hands. The bigger the edge a player has over their opponents, the
higher their win rate. If all players at the table are equally skilled, their win rates will be zero
and, in raked games, they will all lose however much money the house rakes.
 A player‚Äôs win rate depends on the opponents‚Äô skill levels. This is why game selection is key
to the success or failure of all poker players‚Äô careers. Suppose you are a skilled player and there
are two different games that run at your local casino: a tough $10/$20 game where your win rate
is a moderate 2bb/100, and a lower stake $2/$5 game where your win rate is 10bb/100. In the
tough game, you make on average $40 every 100 hands you play but, in the smaller game, you
make on average $50 every 100 hands you play. Over the long run, you will make more money
playing the smaller game while experiencing a lot less variance because swings are typically
higher in the bigger games where you have a lower edge.
 At a 6-max cash table (with no antes), there are 1.5 big blinds in the pot every hand, or 150 big
blinds every 100 hands (150bb/100). Imagine a situation where everyone was afraid to play you
and, any time you raise, your opponents would fold their hands every single time, including AA.
In that case, there would be no reason for you not to raise every hand with any two cards,
attaining a win rate of the full pot for 150bb/100. We know that such a situation is impossible
and, no matter who you are, there are some hands no player will ever fold. More importantly,
there are hands they will likely re-raise (which will force you to fold some hands and forfeit their
equity in the pot) and so we can conclude that no player can achieve a win rate of the full pot
(150bb/100).
 If no player can achieve a win rate of the full pot, how can you figure out what fraction of the
pot you are entitled to capture? Or in other words, how do you determine your win rate?
 Online players‚Äô win rates are quite easy to calculate by using tracking software. After playing
100,000 hands, players start to get an idea of what their actual win rate looks like, but a sample
of at least 1,000,000 hands is required to be statistically significant. Live cash players can get an
estimate of their overall win rate over a period of time using this formula:
 For example, if a live player gets dealt about 300 hands over a 10-hour poker session and
plays five days per week, four weeks per month, they will be dealt approximately 6,000 hands
per month or 72,000 per year. If that player made $100,000 after one year of playing with $5/$10
blinds, their win rate was:
 Win rates tend to be a lot higher in live games compared to online games because live games
are almost always softer than online games. Casinos attract all kinds of recreational players
looking to gamble, socialize and have a good time. These players do not play anywhere near
fundamentally sound poker, resulting in strong players having higher win rates.
 Live players also lack the experience of online players. If a live player plays 300 hands per
day on average then, after one year, they will have played 72,000 hands. Online poker rooms
offer the possibility of multi-tabling, allowing players to play two, four, six, 10, or even 20 tables
at the same time. This, combined with the faster pace of the dealing software compared to the
speed of a human dealer, and the limited timebanks for decision making, results in an
exponential increase in the number of hands online players get dealt. A typical online player can
easily play 3,000 hands in a day, or 720,000 hands in a year. In one year, an online player will
play as many poker hands as a live player will in 10 years! Of course, there are other factors that
come into play and not necessarily all online players are better than live players, but this
difference alone is more than enough to make the average online player a lot tougher than the
average live player.
 Your overall win rate is the average of the win rates you have at each position of the table. At
a 6-max table, if the pot was to get split equally among all six positions, the win rate in each
position would be 25bb/100 but, as we will see, there are many factors that affect players‚Äô
profitability according to their position at the table. In some positions, the win rate can be higher
than 25bb/100, and for others, it will be lower (Table 15).
 The win rate in the blinds is always negative. The BB starts the hand posting 1bb, and the SB
posts 0.5bb, so their win rates start off at -100bb/100 and -50bb/100 respectively. Starting with
such a disadvantage, no matter how good a player is, their win rate in the blinds can never be as
good as the other positions. The BN has the highest win rate because that position gets to play
the most hands profitably. Win rates decrease as the position moves away from the BN.
 Most players lose money when playing poker. That is a fact. You must be really good just to
break even because you have to recover the -150bb/100 you lose to the blinds each round, as
well as the rake the house takes.
 Depending on the stakes you play and the poker site, the rake will usually be between 5 and 10
big blinds per 100 hands. Poker tracking software can be used to find the exact amount paid in
rake, as well as its effect on win rates. It is often the case, particularly in online micro stakes, that
the rake is so high that even strong players cannot win, so my advice to all players is to look
carefully at each site‚Äôs rake structure (as well as rake-back deals and VIP programs) before
deciding where to play. Higher rake can never be good for the players because it only means that
more money is being taken away from the tables and into the house‚Äôs pocket. Note that in ante
games, players also need to be able to recover the antes. An ante of 12.5% the size of the BB is
equivalent to -12.5bb/100.
 So, what can the players do to maximize their win rates and be able to beat the blinds and
rake?
 Your overall win rate is the aggregate of the EVs of all hands you were dealt in all positions
and the actions you took with them. So, the way to maximize your overall win rate is simply by
always taking the highest EV action with each hand you are dealt at every decision point.
 EV can be expressed as a win rate in bb/100, and we know that the EV of folding is 0, so
players should only play hands when the actions they can take have a non-negative win rate.
Example
9-max MTT (12.5% ante), 20bb effective stack. Action folds to the SB who has four options. Go
all-in for 20bb, raise to 2.5bb, limp or fold. We know that the EV of folding is always 0. Let‚Äôs
take a look at the win rates of the four actions for various hands in this situation (Table 16).
 According to the table, the best action to take with AA is to raise 2.5bb, AJo should push
20bb, Q7s should limp and given all actions for 72o have a negative win rate, it should be folded.
 Your overall win rate in the SB when the action folds to you is 88bb/100 (Table 17). That is
simply the aggregate EV of each one of the 1,326 possible hands. The hands with negative EV
will be folded and have 0EV, and all other hands will have EV equal to the highest EV action. If
you choose any action other than the highest EV for each hand vs a GTO opponent, your win
rate in the spot can only go down.
 For example, if you choose to go all-in with 72o, you will lose -63bb/100 on average. Going
all-in with AA is +EV, but not the highest EV play. In fact, going all-in with AA is -136bb/100
worse than raising to 2.5bb, so this mistake is even worse than pushing 72o. It is very important
that you do not make the common mistake of thinking that just because a play is +EV it is the
correct play.
 Any action should always be compared to all other possibilities before deciding your
 play.
 The more hands you can profitably play, and the higher average profitability of each hand, the
higher your win rate will be. Each decision you make on every single hand increases or
decreases your overall win rate. In cash games, win rates are directly proportional to the player‚Äôs
profitability in the games (as seen in Table 18), but in tournaments that is not always the case
because the value of the chips is not directly proportional to their dollar value. We will discuss
tournaments later in the Tournament Theory chapter. That said, win rates can still be quite useful
for tournament players as they say a lot about the player‚Äôs skills and can be used to find leaks
when win rates are lower than expected.
 Different Stakes
 Although the differences in win rates can seem small, they quickly add up as the stakes and
sample size increase. If higher win rates translate to higher winnings, your aim, as a poker
player, should be to increase your win rate as much as possible by consistently taking +EV spots
and avoiding -EV spots. In the long run, the players who make the best decisions on average will
end up with all of the money and the players who make the most mistakes will inevitably lose.

### TOPIC: Complex Strategies
Why do players employ complex strategies? Why don‚Äôt they just implement a simple push/fold
strategy, getting it in with the good hands and folding the bad ones?
 This section will compare two of the simplest pre-flop situations in order to understand the
value of having different strategic options and playing complex strategies.
Situation 1: Hero is in the SB playing OOP vs the BB
Game: 3-max SNG
Stack depths: 8bb, 10bb, 12bb, 15bb, 17bb, 20bb & 25bb
Blinds: 0.5bb/1bb
Players: 3 (no ante)
Pre-flop: (1.5bb) BN folds and the action is on Hero in the SB. He can fold, limp, raise to 2bb,
to 2.5bb, to 3bb, or push all-in.
Situation 2: Hero is on the BN playing IP vs the BB
Game: Heads-up SNG
Stack depths: 8bb, 10bb, 12bb, 15bb, 17bb, 20bb & 25bb
Blinds: 0.5bb/1bb
Players: 2 (no ante)
Pre-flop: (1.5bb) Hero is first to act on the BN. He can fold, limp, raise to 2bb, to 2.5bb, to 3bb,
or push.
 The two situations described are very similar. Hero is in the SB in both, but Situation 1 is a 3-
max game so Hero is OOP vs the BB whereas Situation 2 is heads-up vs the BB, meaning Hero
has the BN and will be IP post-flop. If both players were playing a push/fold only strategy with
no post-flop play, the situations would be equivalent. However, if we solve the spot using
modern pre-flop solvers and give the players additional strategic options such as limping and the
ability to use different raise sizings other than all-in, we can compare the different situations and
try to get some insights about the value of the various strategic options and how they are affected
by position.
 We see that by playing a more complex strategy than push/fold, Hero captures a larger portion
of the pot, an extra 4.62% pot (7bb/100) when out of position and 14.6% pot (22bb/100) when in
position. With very shallow stacks, the EV loss of applying a push/fold only strategy is very
small, but as stacks get deeper, and particularly when having position, the value of other strategic
options increases. Playing a more complex strategy than push/fold yields Hero a higher payoff.
 Hero‚Äôs folding frequency is the highest when playing push/fold (Table 20), which means that
this strategy limits the number of hands Hero can profitably play, particularly as stacks get
deeper. Conversely, the folding frequency is lower when playing a more complex strategy,
especially when having position.
 With over 17bb, pushing is very rarely used by the BN, but becomes the dominant strategy
with fewer than 10bb. The SB pushing frequencies are a lot higher than BN because going all-in
diminishes the disadvantage of being OOP.
 Limping is used 42.51% more often when Hero is IP compared to OOP, becoming the
dominant strategy (Table 23). Notice how limping becomes more important for the SB as stacks
get deeper but remains relatively constant for the BN. This means that when Hero is IP, limping
is almost as important at all stack depths, and when Hero is OOP, limping becomes more
valuable as stacks get deeper when Hero loses the ability to open push very wide.
 The only raise size BN uses is to 2bb (min-raise). Other bet-sizes are used only when Hero is
in the SB, so we can conclude the bigger sizings benefit Hero when OOP, but don‚Äôt add much
value when playing with position.
 Minraising is the dominant strategy at the shorter stack depths (when OOP), but starting with
15bb stacks, 2.5x becomes dominant. 3x begins to be used at 20bb and becomes dominant at
25bb (Diagram 6). So, we can conclude that when playing out of position, bet-size should
increase as stacks get deeper.
Conclusion
Having access to more strategic options increases the player‚Äôs expectation. However, some
strategic options are used so rarely and their overall EV impact is so small that the cost of
implementing them in your strategies may surpass the value they add. In fact, adding too many
low EV/low frequency strategic options to your overall strategy can hurt your expectation. The
more complex the strategy, the more difficult it is to implement so, in practice, you should strive
to simplify your strategies as much as possible in order to minimize mistakes without hurting
your overall expectation.
 In our heads-up example, the simplest possible strategy is push/fold, and it can be applied for
most spots with 10bb and shorter stacks. When out of position, pushing remains vital up to 17bb,
but the BN pushes only 3.88% of hands with 15bb, 1.70% with 17bb, 0.69% with 20bb, and
0.06% with 25bb. So, the BN strategy can be simplified to never push with 15bb or more and the
overall EV of the BN won‚Äôt be hurt significantly. However, the limping strategy is dominant for
the BN, so any strategy that removes BN limps in a heads-up game will significantly hurt its
overall EV.
 Corollary: If playing vs an opponent who we think has superior skill, then playing a complex
strategy only benefits the stronger player because they will be capable of capitalizing on all the
different strategic options better than you are. Thus playing a simpler game helps reduce this
superior Villain‚Äôs edge by minimizing your mistakes. For example, if playing heads-up in an
MTT, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you are against the best player in the world if you get it all-in pre-flop
with a coinflip like AJs vs TT. You will win ~50% of the time, which is a great result when
facing a player who has a huge edge on you.

### TOPIC: Playing First In
Knowing what to do when the action gets folded to you is perhaps the single most important
thing players must learn in their entire poker careers, yet I still see professional players simply
not caring. They mistakenly think they can outplay anyone regardless of their holdings and make
massive fundamental mistakes that cost them dearly in the long run.
 Starting with sound pre-flop ranges improves pre-flop decision making. By systematically
analyzing the game, strong players come to the tables prepared with preset strategies for the most
common situations that get repeated over time. This is similar to chess grandmasters who
memorize the early moves of the most important openings and pre-develop defenses rather than
trying to re-invent them every game. By committing the basic moves to memory, they can focus
their brain power on more complex aspects of the game in order to stay ahead of their opponents.
 A typical online 6-max Cash EP-RFI range can be seen in Hand Range 27.
 Hand Range 27: A Typical Online 6-max Cash EP RFI Range
 Not everyone will play this exact RFI range, but most serious players will play some variation
of it. A player who knows more or less what an EP RFI Range looks like will have a huge
advantage over a player who has never studied the spot before. Instead of hesitating and
wondering whether or not they are supposed to open hands such as JTo, the prepared player
knows JTo is not a standard open and will be aware of spots to expand or shrink their range if
they see an opportunity to exploit a weakness in the other players. Rather than second guessing
themselves all the time, a player who has done the work off the tables will consistently recognise
familiar situations that they will already know how to approach, while their opponents may be
clueless. When they encounter a completely new situation, a player who has studied poker theory
can extrapolate results from other known situations and will make way fewer mistakes compared
to a player who is oblivious to the underlying principles of the game.
 Well-constructed pre-flop ranges also make post-flop play easier, because they will have the
right board coverage and better playability than improvised strategies. There is a lot to be gained
by developing a solid, well-balanced GTO pre-flop baseline strategy. That said, a baseline pre-
flop GTO strategy should only be a starting point. The strongest players are those who can adapt
as circumstances require. Once you have developed sound and balanced strategies for yourself, it
becomes a lot easier to spot when your opponents have not, allowing you to easily realize when
they are unbalanced and exploitable.
 Just as in chess, the rules of poker are quite easy to learn, but there are many underlying
principles that govern the game. Understanding those principles is the key to success. In the next
section we are going to study those principles and develop the building blocks players need to
understand to play solid pre-flop strategies.
Main Variables that Affect Pre-flop Hand Ranges
Absolute Hand Strength
Although hand strength is relative to the composition of the ranges in play, it can sometimes be
helpful to think about hand strength in a vacuum. This is known as absolute hand strength.
Below are the principles used to determine a poker hand‚Äôs absolute hand strength.
 High Card Value: The higher the cards in your hand, the stronger the hand tends to be. A
hand with an ace in it will be stronger than a hand with a king in it which will be stronger than a
hand with a queen in it and so on.
 Pocket Pairs: Applying the high card principle to a pocket pair it follows that the higher the
pocket pair rank, the stronger and more valuable it is (KK>55).
 Suitedness: All things being equal, a suited hand will be stronger than an offsuit one. First of
all, they have more raw equity than their offsuit counterparts and the playability of suited hands
is much better. For example, A‚ô•5‚ô• is preferable to A‚ô•5 because A‚ô•5‚ô• has the ability to flop
nut flushes and the flushes it makes are more disguised than the ones made with a single ace and
four suited cards on the board, making it more likely to get paid when it hits.
 Connectedness: Hands with cards closer in rank to each other are preferred to hands with
gaps in between. For example, T9 is preferable to T8 and T7 because T9 has more ways to make
straights than the other hands: T9 can make a straight on KQJ, QJ8, J87, and 876, and three of
those are nut straights. T8 can make a straight on QJ9, J97, and 976, and only two of those are
nut straights. T7 can make straights on J98 and 986 with only one straight being the nuts.
 In general, the best poker hands have at least two of these components. Hands that lack high
card value can compensate by having great connectedness and suitedness, such as 87s, and hands
that lack suitedness can have great high card value such as AKo.
 As a rule of thumb, the earlier your position at the table, the higher absolute high card strength
your hand must have to be playable. As you get into later positions, weaker absolute hand
strength hands can be played. For example, in a 6-max cash game with no ante, the BN can
profitably play hands as weak and disconnected as Q2s, but from the LJ, the weakest Qx that can
be played is Q9s.
The Size of the Pot
As the pot gets larger in terms of big blinds, more hands can be played profitably. For example,
in a 9-max MTT with 12.5% antes, the size of the pot is 2.625bb. If the action gets folded to the
BN, they can push 10 big blinds with 46% of hands, but without antes, the pot size is only 1.5bb,
and then the BN can only push 33% of hands.
Bet-size
In general, the bottom of your range contains hands that have a low profitability (or are
indifferent), so the bigger your bet-size relative to the pot, the fewer hands you can profitably
play. By betting larger, you risk more, meaning you lose more on average with your weak hands
when you face a re-raise and have to fold. Ideally, you want to lose as little as possible when
your steals fail.
Likelihood of Being Raised/Re-raised
As seen when we studied MDF, if Villains do not defend often enough, you can exploit them by
opening more hands than you would normally be able to. You may even be able to blatantly bet
or raise 100% of hands in some spots. Conversely, against good/optimal opponents, there is a cap
to the number of hands you can profitably play at any given time because they will play back at
you and force you to fold pre-flop, denying your equity in the pot.
Example
Game: Live Cash Game
Effective Stack: 100bb
Blinds: 0.5/1
Players: 6 (no ante)
Pre-flop: (1.5bb) Hero is in the SB with Q7s and raises to 3bb. What can the Villain in the BB
do to make this raise have a negative win rate?
 The EV of Q7s when called is always a positive number because Q7s has a certain amount of
equity in the pot. Even if Villain could somehow make Q7s realize 0% of its post-flop equity, the
worst that could happen is that Hero wins 0% of the pot. The only way Villain can make your
raise unprofitable is to increase their 3-bet frequency, so let‚Äôs figure out how often Villain needs
to 3-bet to make the Q7s raise unprofitable.
 For simplicity we assume Villain will only 3-bet or fold, and that Hero always folds Q7s vs a
3-bet, so:
 To find the values that make the EV of raising Q7s negative we make:
 If Hero gets 3-bet more than 37.5% of the time, opening Q7s becomes -EV. Of course, in a
real poker game, the BB will never 3-bet 37.5% vs the SB, and if they did, they would be
opening up to serious exploitation.
 It is worth noting that the likelihood of getting 3-bet increases as there are more Villains yet to
act. Imagine that instead of the SB, Hero‚Äôs position is UTG. How often can Hero expect to get 3-
bet at a 9-max table?
 On average, we can expect Hero to be 3-bet roughly 7% of the time by each player yet to act.
Ignoring blocker effects, the total frequency Hero can expect to get 3-bet is:
 At a 9-max table with eight villains left to act, Hero can expect to be 3-bet ~44% of the time.
Assuming Hero will fold to a 3-bet, raising Q7s has a negative win rate:
 Ignoring opponents‚Äô calls, the win rate of raising to 2.5x from UTG with Q7s at a 9-max table
is -26bb/100.
 The number of hands a player can profitably RFI depends on the likelihood of being 3-bet.
Since the likelihood of being 3-bet increases as there are more players yet to act, as your
positional advantage increases you can profitably raise with more hands (this is the main reason
players get to play more hands from the BN than from UTG).
Rake Effect
When the rake is taken from the pot, it has an effect on players‚Äô strategies because it reduces the
profitability of all hands being played. Many hands that are marginally +EV raises or calls
become -EV and lose money over the long run. One of the main reasons cash games tend to have
larger bet-sizings than tournaments is to discourage calls. Since the rake is paid in tournaments
along with the buy-in, it has no effect on the profitability of the hands played in-game, allowing
for more passive play in tournaments compared to cash games with high rake. In general, the
higher the rake, the tighter the pre-flop ranges should be. Aggressive actions that can take the pot
down pre-flop will take precedence over passive actions.
Example
Game: Online heads-up Cash Game
Effective Stack: $1,000
Players: 2
Blinds: $5/$10 (no ante)
Pre-flop: Hero in the BN
Let‚Äôs compare Hero‚Äôs BN GTO strategy without rake compared to a $5/$10 game with a 4.3%
Rake, $2.20 maximum structure.
 As we can see, when rake is a factor, raising frequency increases, limping frequency is
reduced, and more hands get folded (Hand Ranges 28 and 29).
 Next, let‚Äôs make the same comparison for the BB strategy facing a 2.5bb raise from the SB
(Hand Ranges 30 and 31).
 Hand Range 28: Heads-up BN GTO strategy (No Rake)
 ‚Ä¢ Raise 2.5bb 70.1% / ‚Ä¢ Limp 18.3% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 11.6%
Hand Range 29: Heads-up BN GTO strategy (Rake Adjusted)
 ‚Ä¢ Raise 2.5bb 76.4% / ‚Ä¢ Limp 6.9% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 16.7%
Hand Range 30: Heads-up BB vs BN 2.5x Open GTO strategy (No Rake)
 ‚Ä¢ 3Bet 10bb 19.9% / ‚Ä¢ Call 55% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 25%
 Hand Range 31: Heads-up BB vs BN 2.5x Open GTO strategy (Rake Adjusted)
 ‚Ä¢ 3Bet 10bb 22.7% / ‚Ä¢ Call 45% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 32.3%
 Again, for the BB rake-adjusted solution we see an increase in raising frequency, a decrease in
calling frequency and more folding than in the solution with no rake.
Bunching Effect
Folding ranges have an impact on the hand distribution of the players left to act. For example, at
a 9-max table, after six folds, the BN‚Äôs raise first in range has to be tighter at a 3-max table
because other players have already folded ‚Äúweak‚Äù hands, meaning the likelihood that the blinds
have a strong hand increases.
 In Table 24 we can see how pushing ranges generated with MonkerSolver change due to the
bunching effect for different stack depths at different table sizes (12.5% ante). These results are
compared to those of the traditional push/fold calculator HRC (which ignores the bunching
effect).
 Accounting for the bunching effect, the SB has to push on average 4.9% tighter than
traditional push/fold calculators suggest, BN has to be 2.2% tighter, CO 1.7%, HJ 0.9%, and LJ
0.3%. The earlier the position, the lower the bunching effect because fewer players have folded,
hence in early position, the bunching effect can be dismissed because it approaches zero.

### TOPIC: Limping
It is important to also discuss the possibility of limping and also what strategy to adopt when
facing limpers.
Open Limp
Limping allows you to play a wider distribution of hands by investing the minimum amount
possible, but the tradeoff is having to play post-flop most of the time allowing your opponents to
realize equity they would have otherwise folded. Additionally, developing a limping strategy
involves splitting your ranges early, which gives your opponents a lot of information about your
hand strength.
 For example, if you only limp hands such as small pairs, weak suited aces and suited
connectors, your opponents will be able to play well against you because some flops will hit you
quite hard while others will miss completely. If you limp only medium strength hands, your
opponents get to raise aggressively because you never have hands strong enough to re-raise. This
will force you to start limping some strong hands to balance your limping range, which will
weaken your raising range. Then you will still have the problem of having a capped range on
many flops after you limp/call because you no longer have the top of your range (because you
will have limp/re-raised your strongest hands).
 While this analysis may sound grim, limping strategies do have their place in GTO play.
Solvers like applying them primarily in blind vs blind battles in rake-free environments such as
tournaments. However, given the nature of modern games where most player populations under-
defend their blinds, over-fold to c-bets, don‚Äôt 3-bet often enough, and don‚Äôt peel as often as they
should (even in tough games), raising has a lot of added value and will remain the dominant
strategy for some time to come. Despite the obvious advantages of raising in today‚Äôs games, due
to the proliferation of solvers and GTO strategies, I expect to see an increase in the use of
limping strategies in the future, especially in tournaments.
 For the scope of this book, limping strategies will be limited to situations where the EV they
add to your overall strategy is significant, particularly when playing vs tough opponents.
Facing Limpers
It is very infrequent to see open limps in modern online poker, unless you are playing
microstakes. In live games, however, limping happens far more often, and the reason for this is
the exact same reason it happens in online microstakes: the presence of very weak players.
 For the reasons outlined earlier, most strong players won‚Äôt implement limping strategies, so in
general if you see a player open limp from any other position than the SB you can pretty safely
assume they aren‚Äôt a really strong player. If that‚Äôs the case there are a few different ways you can
attack them depending on the type of player they are.
Weak Passive
If the limper is the type of player who rarely raises and tends to check-fold when they miss, you
can isolate them with a very wide range and expect to take down the pot post-flop with a very
high frequency.
 How wide you can isolate this player will depend on the other players at the table. If they are
willing to attack you with 3-bets you should be careful and raise a similar range to what you
would open from that position if the action was folded to you. If they will be calling a lot of
raises which will lead to multi-way pots, you need to have hands that play well in multi-way pots
such as suited connectors, pocket pairs and Axs. If the players behind you are not aware or
aggressive, you can get away with raising almost anything that has some playability.
Sticky
If the limper is the type of player who doesn‚Äôt like to fold, you should play hands that will flop
good top pairs and then take them to value town. Against this type of player, any top pair and
most second pairs are good enough to value-bet for three streets.
 It is fine to semi-bluff against them but if your draw bricks on the river be ready to give up
most of the time and never run stone cold bluffs. There is nothing they love more than calling
down with bottom pair across all three streets to be shown the old airball!
Aggressive
If the limper is very aggressive and will be check-raising and leading against you, do yourself a
favor and don‚Äôt isolate this player too wide. Your range should be made up of very strong hands
that can stand the heat. Be careful with your medium strength hands by checking them and
controlling the size of the pot so you can bluff-catch more efficiently, and if you have a good but
not great hand, don‚Äôt be afraid of playing for stacks.
Trappy
If the limper is the trappy type and limps in with strong hands such as AK and AA with the
intention of limp-raising, feel free to over-limp with all sorts of suited and connected hands and
small pocket pairs. Other players at the table will hesitate to raise behind because of the threat of
a limp-raise and you will be able to play very well post-flop against this face-up range.
 Against this type of player, you should raise a polarized range constructed of hands that can
withstand a 3-bet and hands that have good blockers and you are happy to raise-fold.

### TOPIC: Open Push
Going all-in, also referred to as open pushing, is the most powerful bet you can make. It allows
you to realize 100% of your equity with all of the hands in your range, but also involves the
higher risk of putting your entire stack on the line. You can no longer fold the weaker hands in
your range when your opponents would have 3-bet you if you had raised to a smaller size. In
general, the more chips you have and the more players left to act, the less inclined you should be
to go all-in.
Example 1
At a 9-max table with 12.5% antes and a 10bb stack, UTG can only push 14.4% hands whereas
the SB can push 74.7%. This is because UTG has to worry about other eight players waking up
with a strong hand while SB only has to worry about the BB.
Example 2
At a 9-max table with 12.5% antes and a 12bb stack, the BN can open push 41.5% hands but
with 15bb can only open push 37.2% hands. As you risk more chips, you must raise tighter.
 In general, with fewer than 10bb, players can open push from any position. The earlier your
position and the larger your stack, the tighter you should push (Table 25).
 In general, when going all-in pre-flop, if you are shoving your entire range, you want your
range to be linear, consisting of the top hands that have the best equity when called.
 If you are splitting your range by using a shove/raise/fold strategy, you want your open
shoving range to be condensed, consisting of hands that are too good to raise/fold, while not
good enough to raise/call, and will have good equity when called, like Axs, Q9s and 87s.
 You want your non-all-in raising range to be polar, consisting of hands with good blocker
value such as Axo that you plan to fold if your opponent pushes, and premium hands you are
happy to raise/call, such as KK.

### TOPIC: General Guidelines for Pre-flop Bet-sizing
The earlier your position, the smaller your bet-sizing should be because the threat of opponents
waking up with re-raising hands increases. The wider your range becomes, the bigger your bet-
sizing should be because more of your opponents‚Äô hands will have the right equity to call the
same raise size vs a wider range. In general, when facing a bet or raise, the bigger the bet-size
faced, the smaller number of hands you have to defend to remain unexploitable.
 Multiple bet-sizes should be used only in different situations. For example, you can use
different bet-sizes for the BN and UTG, or use different bet-sizes for different stack depths, but
bet-size should never be changed depending on your hand strength because, by doing so, you
convey a lot of information about your range early on, and that information can be used to
exploit weaknesses in your hand distribution.
 When the opponents left to act have good rejamming stack depths (under 25bb) the optimal
bet-size is always a min-raise because it gives them the worst possible price on their all-in re-
raise. With deeper stacks, bigger bet-sizings are better because your opponents are getting better
implied odds with their speculative hands, so you want to discourage them from calling,
especially when they have position.
 If you are re-raising pre-flop with a polarized range, and your opponent‚Äôs main response is to
re-raise or fold, you should use the minimum bet-size possible to minimize your losses with the
raise/folding hands in your range.
 Being out of position favors larger bet-sizes because you want to decrease the positional
advantage of the IP player by reducing the SPR. Conversely, having position favors the use of
smaller bet-sizes because, even if called, you still have the positional advantage on the later
betting rounds. However, betting small also has some disadvantages, such as giving your
opponents a better price on their calls, allowing them to defend profitably with more hands.
 Using solvers to test pre-flop bet-sizing, I found that for similar bet-sizes, the differences in
EV are quite small and even indifferent in many situations. For example, going from a 2.25bb to
a 2.3bb open size won‚Äôt have a significant EV impact in your bottom line.
 The solvers are indifferent to using similar bet-sizings as long as the other player understands
the best way to respond to each specific bet-size. Since different bet-sizes will have different
optimal responses, and not all opponents will be capable of responding effectively to all bet-
sizes, the best bet-size is the one that takes your opponents to a branch of the game tree with
which they are unfamiliar, leading them to make the greatest number of mistakes.
 There must be a sweet spot for pre-flop bet-sizing that lowers your risk while maximizing fold
equity. However, the game of poker is not fully solved yet, so there is no definite answer to the
‚Äúcorrect‚Äù pre-flop bet-sizing. Furthermore, there is always room for exploitative bet-sizing
against specific opponents, making applying the general bet-size guidelines more of an art form
than a science.

### TOPIC: General Pre-flop Play Heuristics
You will always take the highest EV action with each hand in your range at any decision point.
Note the following points.
From each position, you will play a distribution of hands that is strong relative to the
random hands yet to act.
If another player has voluntarily entered the pot, your hand distribution has to be strong relative
to the remaining random hands and the hand distribution of the player who entered the pot. For
example, the CO raising range vs an UTG limp has to be tighter than the raising range if the
action was folded to the CO because CO has to be concerned about the UTG limper.
 From each position, you will play some variety of hands that will have a positive expectation
against the remaining players (including the rake effect in raked games).
In general, hands that use mixed strategies (sometimes raising and sometimes folding) are
threshold hands.
Given the card removal effects in Hold‚Äôem you can expect to see more hands having mixed
strategies. The worst hands in your range will have zero EV and will be indifferent between
raising and folding when playing against good/optimal opponents. However, you can increase
your raising frequency by adding more weak hands to your range against weak opponents
because they won‚Äôt be playing back at you aggressively enough to make the bottom of your
regular raising range indifferent.
Whenever we are exploitatively opening a wider range than usual and face a 3-bet, it‚Äôs fine
to over-fold.
You are exploiting the fact that you won‚Äôt get 3-bet often enough by playing off-range hands. So,
when you get 3-bet, your adjustment should be to fold all off-range hands and even hands that
would be the bottom of your regular calling range.
 The most important players to consider when deciding whether or not to open marginal hands
are the BN, SB and the BB because those positions are the most likely to give you action. If the
players in those positions are tight, you can get away with a lot of blind stealing.
In poker, randomizing refers to the employment of aleatoric selection between equivalent
EV actions to guarantee unpredictability.
For example, if a hand is indifferent to calling or folding (the EV of both actions is the same) and
the GTO solution is to call 50% and fold 50%, the player can randomize these two actions by
flipping a coin. Online players can use a random number generator (e.g. random.org) to help
them stay unpredictable with hands that have mixed strategies.
 Live players can use a number of randomizers such as the seconds hand on a clock or the suit
of their hole cards. For example, the probability of the top card of a two-card hand being a red
card is 50%, so a player can randomize using the color of the top card of their poker hand.
Players can also choose a suit such as hearts, and if their first card is a heart, choose various 25%
plays. They can also simply look at a random number generator app before starting each hand.
There are many tricks players can use to randomize their actions in live games. However, live
games are often particularly soft, so wise decisions tend to be more binary, and there are
regularly additional pieces of information players can use to tie-break close decisions, such as
body language, history, population tendencies, etc. All of this, along with the fact that it will be
tough for your opponents to get a large enough sample on you to be able to unravel your exact
frequencies makes randomizing less needed in live poker than online poker.
The best approach when exploitatively widening your ranges is to start by increasing the
frequency of hands that are played with a mixed strategy.
This is because the threshold hands are the first hands to become profitable against Villain leaks.
For example, if a hand such as A9o is bet 25% of the time in some spot, the best exploit against a
player who overfolds will be to bet A9o 100% of the time. From there, you can add hands that
are very close to the borderline hands, such as perhaps A8o and A7o, instead of randomly adding
something like Q4o. This type of adjustment is more difficult to spot by the Villain, decreasing
the likelihood of them counter-exploiting you, and when you do get counter-exploited or are
wrong about your assessment of the Villain‚Äôs leak, the hands you are adding to your strategy will
have the right blockers, meaning they won‚Äôt be as -EV as random hands.
Avoid putting yourself in difficult spots by always thinking a few steps ahead.
For example, if you are thinking about 3-betting with a medium strength hand but would not
know what to do if your opponent re-raises, you should call instead. This also applies post-flop.
If you don‚Äôt know what to do with your hand if your opponent re-raises, then check instead.
Before open raising, always consider the players yet to act. Are they likely to re-raise you? If so,
how would you react against a re-raise? And what if they 5-bet after you 4-bet? Are you happy
getting this hand all-in pre-flop? Is your hand too good to 4-bet/fold? If so, just call if you get 3-
bet. Thinking ahead will allow you to sidestep many difficult spots recreational players find
themselves in on a regular basis.
 Poker players tend to have two main types of leak. Either their action frequencies are
 wrong, or they put the wrong type of hands in their ranges.
 Typically, the first and easiest leak to fix is when your frequencies are wrong, which is
particularly true when playing online poker. Most online regulars will have a HUD (Heads Up
Display) that shows the frequency with which players take different actions. In this case it
becomes very evident when their tendencies are far away from optimal.
 For example, if you know that the optimal RFI frequency from the LJ in a cash game is ~17%
and you notice you are opening 22%, then you should cut down the extra 5% of hands from your
range if you think you are being exploited by your opponents.
 The other type of leak is a lot harder to spot, as a player could have very well been taking
actions with the right frequencies, but putting the wrong hands in their range. This is the main
reasons most regulars struggle to move up in stakes. More often than not they don‚Äôt even know
where to start looking. They understand their own and their opponents stats, and they have a
general idea of what the ranges look like but they also notice the top players shifting gears and
showing up all the time with stuff they didn‚Äôt expect them to have. They ask their coaches and
friends and they all seem to have different answers to the same questions.
 In the next chapter I aim to show you not only the right frequencies but also the right range
composition, so you can estimate by yourself how to adapt to the different situations at the poker
table, think on your feet, attack your opponent‚Äôs leaks and fix your own.

### TOPIC: 6-MAX CASH GAME EQUILIBRIUM STRATEGIES (100BB)
This chapter presents GTO recommended 6-max baseline strategies produced with modern
solvers and supercomputers for a typical $2/$5 online cash game, 5% rake, capped at $3. These
strategies are designed to be a solid guideline but they must be adjusted to the specific games
you find yourself in.
 The best use for GTO solvers is to analyze the recommended strategies and try to understand
why the solver is choosing to play hands in the way it does, incorporating the underlying GTO
principles such as pot odds, equity, fold equity, EV, equity realization, SPR, range polarization,
board coverage, MDF, exploitation and balance to our decision-making process instead of trying
to memorize fixed strategies.
 In some sense, you should try to ‚Äúbecome‚Äù the solver so you can determine the correct
 decision for yourself. Each hand is a puzzle, and solving that puzzle to the best of your
 ability is your job as a poker player.
Charts are a good starting point. They can be used to guide you in the right direction but should
never be followed blindly.

### TOPIC: Recommended Bet-sizings
This section presents bet-sizes based on the previously discussed principles, extensive testing
with pre-flop GTO solvers and discussions with world class players. In live cash games, bet-sizes
tend to be a lot bigger than online, but live cash games also tend to be played with deeper stacks,
which will generate similar post-flop SPRs. Following are the recommended sizings.
Heads-up
BN RFI: 2.5bb, BB 3-bet: 10bb, BN 4-bet: 23bb, BB 5-bet: All-in (100bb).
6-Max
RFI: LJ, HJ, CO, BN: 2.5bb, SB: 3bb.
3-bet: IP: 8.5bb, OOP: 10bb (when squeezing you can add 2-3bb)
4-bet: 23bb
5-bet: All-in (100bb)
BvB
SB Limp:
BB Raise vs SB Limp: 3.5bb
SB 3-bet: 13bb
BB 4-bet: 28bb
SB 5-bet: All-in (100bb)
SB Raise:
SB: 3bb
BB 3-bet: 9bb
SB 4-bet: 24bb
BB 5-bet: All-in (100bb)

### TOPIC: GTO Raise First In Strategies
We will start the pre-flop analysis with the simplest possible scenario, blind vs blind battles. We
will then expand the strategies by incorporating BN, CO, HJ, and finally LJ. It is important to
note that these baseline strategies are computed using the recommended bet-sizes, so adjustments
have to be made when facing different bet-sizes.
Small Blind
The small blind is one of the most interesting and difficult positions to play. You will be out of
position the entire hand, which reduces your ability to realize equity and makes playing less
enticing. However, you also have a discount in your price to enter the pot, which incentivizes
you to play more hands.
 The best approach to SB play when the action gets folded to you is to split your range,
developing a limping strategy and a raising strategy (Hand Range 32). By incorporating a
limping strategy, you get to play more hands, taking advantage of the discount to enter the pot
while keeping your overall raise frequency low, making BB‚Äôs 3-bets less effective. Also, the SB
is the position where you want to have a bigger open raise size because you are out of position
and want to discourage calls.
 Hand Range 32: SB RFI
 ‚Ä¢ 3x 24.4% / ‚Ä¢ Limp 37.7% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 37.9%
 After SB limps and BB raises to 3.5x, the SB wants to re-raise a linear range made of high
equity hands, so if you get 4-bet, you can call and have hands that will have better equity
realization in low SPRs. Against a 4-bet, you slowplay AA by calling (98%), and 5-bet push KK
(100%), QQ (100%), AK (100%), JJ (32%), TT (64%), 99 (6%) and A5s (78%) (Hand Range
33).
 After you raise to 3x from the SB and face a BB 3-bet, most of your middle strength hands
really hate to 4-bet/fold vs an all-in and just want to take a flop. Therefore your 4-bet range is
polarized, consisting of hands with good blockers that are happy to either call or fold vs a 5-bet
push while having good board coverage in case Villain decides to flat the 4-bet (Hand Range
34). Your stacking off range vs a 5-bet push is 66+, AKo, AQs+.
 Hand Range 33: SB Limp vs BB 3.5x Iso Raise
 ‚Ä¢ L/R 13.4% / ‚Ä¢ Call 39.8% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 46.8%
 Hand Range 34: SB 3x Raise vs BB 3-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 4-bet 17.2% / ‚Ä¢ Call 37.4% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 45.4%
Button
When the action folds to you on the BN, you play a raise or fold strategy (Hand Range 35).
 Hand Range 35: BN RFI
 ‚Ä¢ Raise 2.5x: 43.4% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 56.6%
 As explained before, the rake makes open limping a lot less profitable in cash games and,
unlike the SB, the other positions don‚Äôt get a discount on their limps. By limping from other
positions, you encourage other players to enter the pot which is not a desirable outcome because,
in multi-way pots, the pot will be split among more players. Furthermore, the likelihood of other
players raising over your limps increases with the number of players left to act. Therefore
limping from any position other than the SB involves a higher risk of getting raised, which will
either force you to put more money into the pot or fold your hand, thus denying your equity. By
playing a raise or fold strategy, you make sure your range is well protected and can be easily
defended against 3-bets.
 When the action folds to you in the SB, you get to play 62.21% hands. However, unlike the
SB, you don‚Äôt get a discount to play your hands and you now have to worry about two players
who might have a re-raising hand. Even with your positional advantage over the blinds, the BN
equilibrium strategy is to open a maximum of 43.4% of hands including all pairs, A2s+, A4o+,
K2s+, Q2s+, J4s+, K8o+, Q9o+, J8o+, T8o+, 98o+, suited connectors and suited gappers. In soft
games, if the blinds are overfolding vs opens, the raising range can be easily expanded to 55-
60% hands, or even more, depending on how bad and passive the blinds are.
 The BN defense strategy against both blinds is very similar (see Diagram 7 and Hand Ranges
36 and 37). You fold a little less against a SB 3-bet because the pot is slightly bigger when SB 3-
bets (27bb) compared to when BB 3-bets (26bb). Since you have position and the blinds can put
in the last bet if you 4-bet them (forcing you to fold your equity) you do better having a polarized
4-betting range consisting of hands with good blockers and reasonable board coverage. If you get
5-bet, your getting in range is 66+, AK+ (it‚Äôs important to notice how hands such as 66 are
present in your 4-bet range with a very small frequency at this point, but they are getting in when
you do have them).
 Hand Range 36: BN vs SB 3-bet
‚Ä¢ 4-bet 8.1% / ‚Ä¢ Call 48.9% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 43.1%
 Hand Range 37: BN vs BB 3-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 4-bet 8.6% / ‚Ä¢ Call 47.3% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 44.5%
Cutoff
While the CO position may seem similar to the BN, it actually plays quite differently. You now
have to worry not only about the blinds, but also the BN who has position on you and can call or
3-bet as they see fit. So, the total hands you can play from the CO gets reduced to 27.8%. From
the CO, hands such as K2s, Q5s-Q2s, J6s-J4s, A7o-A2o, offsuit connectors and suited gappers
are not strong enough to enter the pot (Hand Range 38).
 Hand Range 38: CO RFI
 ‚Ä¢ Raise 2.5x: 27.8% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 72.2%
 When facing 3-bets, if you have position, your strategy involves mostly calling, leaving your
4-betting range very polarized (Diagram 8). However, vs the BN, you are much more
incentivized to 4-bet and try to either take the pot pre-flop or force a low post-flop SPR to reduce
the BN‚Äôs positional advantage (Hand Range 39). Playing out of position post-flop makes
realizing your hand‚Äôs equity much more difficult, so you are forced to call less and fold more
against the BN than against the blinds (Hand Ranges 40 and 41).
 Hand Range 39: CO vs BN 3-bet
‚Ä¢ 4-bet 20.6% / ‚Ä¢ Call 20.4% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 59%
 Hand Range 40: CO vs SB 3-bet
‚Ä¢ 4-bet 11.1% / ‚Ä¢ Call 35.8% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 53.1%
 Hand Range 41: CO vs BB 3-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 4-bet 10.3% / ‚Ä¢ Call 37.6% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 52.1%
Hijack
From the HJ you have to worry about four players still to act and two of them have position,
which will limit your ability to play many hands profitably. The total hands you can play at
equilibrium is reduced to 21.4%, trimming down on smaller pairs, the worst offsuit broadways,
suited connectors and weak suited Kx and Qx (Hand Range 42).
 Hand Range 42: HJ RFI
 ‚Ä¢ Raise 2.5x: 21.4% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 78.6%
 On average, you fold a lot less against 3-bets when you have position, defending mostly by
calling against the blinds and 4-betting more often when out of position. Also, you get to call
with a wider range against BN 3-bets than against the CO because the BN has a flat calling
range, so their 3-betting range is a lot more polarized than the CO (Table 26 and Diagram 9). In
general, opening ranges have better equity and playability against polarized ranges, making more
hands profitable calls.
The HJ response to 3-bets is seen in Hand Ranges 43-46.
 Hand Range 43: HJ vs CO 3-bet

Lojack
The LJ is the position where you start having to be much more careful, playing only 17.1%
hands. If you decide to enter the pot, you have to take on five other players who can play back at
you and three of them have position, hindering your ability to realize equity. You mostly get to
play high equity hands with really good blockers and a small portion of suited connectors and
small pairs for the purposes of board coverage (Hand Range 47).
The LJ response to 3-bets is seen in Diagram 10 and Hand Ranges 48-52.

### TOPIC: Playing vs 3-bets: General Heuristics
Well-constructed ranges are designed in such a way that they maximize the number of hands that
can be played profitably while remaining unexploitable against the other players at the table. If a
player attempts to play a BN range (~43% hands) from the LJ (~17% hands), they will get
destroyed because they will no longer be able to defend enough of this range (~48%) against the
remaining players. They will have to fold way more than 52% of their range when facing 3-bets
and will also have to call with many marginal hands that will give them a lot of trouble post-flop.
 The only thing that stops players from 3-betting you relentlessly is your ability to 4-bet, as
well as the likelihood of other players coming over the top. You must defend enough of your
range against 3-bets so that Villains are indifferent to 3-betting you with the bottom of their
range (Diagrams 11 and 12).
 You will get 3-bet a lot more often when opening UTG than when opening from the BN
(despite your strong range) due to the number of players yet to act, and your opponents will have
stronger ranges. Defending a wide range is a lot more difficult than defending a tight range, so
you can‚Äôt profitably open as many hands from UTG as you can from the BN. If your opponent‚Äôs
3-betting range is polarized, more hands in your range will have the right equity to call due to
being dominated less often, leading to better post-flop playability. So, you get to call more of
your range against polarized ranges compared to linear ranges.
 Suited broadways, suited connectors and pocket pairs make good calling hands. Offsuit
broadways and weak Ax don‚Äôt play too well in 3-bet pots because they have very poor equity
realization and bad reverse implied odds and so, in general, they get folded.
 If you think someone is out of line with their 3-bet frequency then, to exploit them, you first
need to assess how they will react to a 4-bet. If they will fold most of the time, you can 4-bet a
polarized range, opting to bluff with hands that have good blockers, such A5s. If the Villain is
likely to call your 4-bet with a wide range and only 5-bet premium hands, the best approach is to
4-bet a linear range so you extract immediate value and have a strong range post-flop. If the
Villain is likely to 5-bet all-in wide, then don‚Äôt be afraid to 4-bet/call off with hands such as AQ.
Sometimes they will get your stack but, more often than not, you will get theirs.
 The smaller your opponent‚Äôs 3-bet size, the more hands in your range you need to defend in
order to remain unexploitable. Against smaller sizes, you should call more hands and,
conversely, the bigger the bet-size, the fewer hands you need to defend.
 Rake effects are reduced in pots that are already inflated by pre-flop action. So when deciding
to enter the pot by 3-betting or 4-betting, the main concern should be the ranges and equities in
play.
 When facing a 5-bet, your general getting in range should be TT+ and AK.
 Once the action gets to you after an open raise and a 3-bet, in general you will 4-bet or fold.
Splitting your range into cold calling and cold 4-betting presents problematic issues that give
away information about your hand. Cold calling also allows active players to realize their equity
by calling many hands they would have folded vs a 4-bet, so the best approach is to simply cold
4-bet all of your continuing range or ~3% hands vs tight ranges and ~6% hands vs wide ranges
(Hand Range 53).
 Hand Range 53: BB Cold 4-betting Versus: ‚Ä¢ LJ & HJ / ‚Ä¢ CO & BN / ‚Ä¢ BN & SB
General Strategy When Facing 3-bets vs Each Position
Your response to a 3-bet should vary depending upon which position the 3-bet comes from
(Diagram 13).
Versus HJ 3-bet
Since the HJ is playing a 3-bet or fold strategy vs the LJ, their range will be very linear and
overlap considerably with the the LJ range. The LJ‚Äôs best response is to mostly defend by 4-
betting to reduce their positional disadvantage by reducing the SPR and getting the HJ to fold
some of their equity.
Versus CO 3-bet
Against the CO, you can 4-bet slightly wider than vs the HJ because the CO 3-bet range is
slightly wider than the HJ 3-betting range. Also, you are happier getting all-in with JJ and TT
pre-flop.
Versus BN 3-bet
The BN 3-bet range is more polarized than that of the HJ and CO because the BN has a small
calling range, which means more hands in your range have the right equity to call the 3-bet. Your
4-betting range starts to get more polarized and middling hands like AQs, AJs and KQs get
called more often.
Versus SB 3-bet
You have position against the SB so you don‚Äôt need to 4-bet as often as you do against the other
positions. Now the only hands that really want to get all-in pre-flop are AA, KK and AKs. High
equity hands such as suited broadways mostly want to call. So, pick the suited broadways and
next-tier suited hands as your 4-bet bluffs. Premium pairs such as QQ and JJ like seeing flops, so
they are 4-bet less often.
Versus BB 3-bet
The BB 3-betting range is polar and you have position, so your main defense will be to call and
play post-flop in position with a solid range. You can start to slow play AA a small percentage of
the time when you are in the HJ. Your 4-betting range against the BB is polarized and some of
your frequent bluffs are A5s-A3s, AQo-ATo, some suited Kx. Suited broadways, suited
connectors and big pairs make great calls because they play well in 3-bet pots and will realize a
lot of their equity.

### TOPIC: General Guidelines Playing Versus Open Raises
In this section we will discuss GTO 3-betting and exploitative 3-betting.
GTO 3-betting
When playing against tough players who you know have sound RFI strategies and will defend
correctly against 3-bets, you should try to stick to equilibrium 3-betting strategies and, if
possible, use some sort of randomization to help stay balanced. Furthermore, you must be careful
not to get exploited, meaning you must defend your 3-bets correctly against 4-bets.
 When considering 3-betting, you need to assess the strength of Villain‚Äôs range. The stronger
their range, the stronger hands you should pick as bluffs (you must pick stronger hands to use as
a bluff vs the LJ than vs the BN).
 If you have a flat calling range (mostly from BN or when IP), then your 3-bet range has to be
polarized because you are flatting high equity hands that don‚Äôt want to get 4-bet. Therefore, your
3-betting range will consist of your best hands plus the next tier of hands that are not great calls,
have equity or good blockers and can offer good board coverage.
 If you don‚Äôt have a flat calling range (mostly in the HJ, CO and SB), then your 3-betting range
must be linear. If you are playing a 3-bet or fold only strategy, you want to put only your best
hands in the 3-betting range and fold everything else.
 When you want to split your range into a calling range and a re-raising range, if stack depths
are such that the Villain can re-raise all-in, you want your re-raising range to be polarized. This is
because you want to put all high equity hands that you don‚Äôt want to re-raise/fold in your flatting
range.
Exploitative 3-betting
When you suspect Villain is a weak player and or is opening more hands than they should, you
should try to exploit them by increasing your 3-betting frequencies. However, you must be
careful if there are other active players in the hand because if they pick up on what you are
doing, they can start cold 4-betting wider and exploit you, even if the weak player never realizes
you are exploiting them.
 The best way to assess quickly if a Villain might be over-folding to 3-bets is to use MDF and
the Alpha number.
Example
Game: Live Cash Game
Effective Stack: $500
Players: 8
Blinds: $2/$5 (no ante)
Pre-flop: The action folds to the SB who raises to $15. You have seen him make some
questionable opens with Q3o and 64o from SB before, so you estimate they may be opening
approximately 76% hands (Hand Range 54).
 Hand Range 54: Villain‚Äôs SB Range
Hero is in the BB with K2‚ô†.
Can Hero profitably exploit this Villain by 3-bet bluffing with K2‚ô†?
Using the Alpha number equation, if you 3-bet Villain to $45, you risk $40 to win $20:
 Villain‚Äôs full range (76.47% hands) contains 1,014 combos.
 So, if Villain is defending with fewer than 334.62 combos, you have an immediately profitable
bluff.
 Hand Range 55: SB Defense vs BB (350 combos) [Fishy Player] ‚Ä¢ Defended 34.5% / ‚Ä¢ Folded
 65.5%
 You can see in Hand Range 55 that the SB defending range contains 350 combos, so you
don‚Äôt have an immediately profitable bluff with ATC, but your hand, K2‚ô†, has a valuable
blocker to Villain‚Äôs continuing range. The K blocks continuing hands such as AK, KK, K6s+,
and KTo+. By having the K blocker in your hand, Villain‚Äôs defending range decreases from 350
to 324 combos, making your 3-bet bluff now show an immediate profit.
 There are two main types of exploitative 3-betting.
 Polarized 3-betting: If Villain is more likely to 4-bet or fold than to call, you can
 increase your 3-bet range to include more hands that have good blockers to their
 continuing range. For example, AJo, A5s, and KJs can flat call because they are high
 equity hands that you don‚Äôt want to 3-bet/fold.
 Linear 3-betting: If Villain is more likely to call your 3-bets than 4-bet, then you want to
 3-bet a linear range made of high equity hands that also have great post-flop playability
 and will dominate Villain‚Äôs flatting range.

### TOPIC: Specific Ranges Playing Versus Open Raises
Here we analyse the GTO solutions to playing vs open raises from each position and discuss the
key factors that are implied by the construction of the ranges.
Hijack
The HJ plays a 3-bet/fold strategy with no calling range when facing the LJ‚Äôs raise (Hand Range
56). From this position the maximum number of hands you can 3-bet and remain unexploitable is
~8% hands. It might be surprising to the reader that this strategy has a small weight in pocket
pairs such as 88 to 22, because if 88 is clearly better than 22 then why not only 3-bet 88 more
frequently instead of 22? The main reason is that you want to have good post-flop board
coverage and be able to hit sets and other strong hands on many different types of flop texture.
Another reason is that if you only 3-bet specific hands, your opponents will be able to use their
blockers more effectively against you.
 Against a LJ 4-bet, you want to 5-bet ~18.4% of the time, but since you have position, your
main response is still going to be to call with most of your continuing range, slowplaying AA
52% of the time and just calling pairs that are weaker than KK. Other hands that like taking flops
are the small suited connectors, AKo (46%), AQs, AJs, KQs and a small fraction of A5s-A4s
(Hand Range 57).
Hand Range 56: HJ vs LJ Open
 ‚Ä¢ 3-bet 8.1% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 91.8%
 Hand Range 57: HJ vs LJ 4-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 5-bet All-in 18.4% / ‚Ä¢ Call 43.3% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 38.3%
Cutoff
The CO 3-betting range vs LJ open is slightly wider than the HJ vs LJ one because now there is
one fewer Villain to worry about (Hand Range 58). Still, the LJ range is strong enough by itself,
so you only get to 3-bet 0.5% more often.
 The hands that really want to get all-in pre-flop are KK and AKs (100%). QQ only wants to
get all-in ~7% of the time. AA is slowplayed 48% of the time, and AKo gets called 46% of the
time. A5s calls 39% and A4s calls 30% (Hand Range 59).
 Hand Range 58: CO vs LJ Open ‚Ä¢ 3-bet 8.6% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 91.4%
 Hand Range 59: CO vs LJ 4-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 5-bet All-in 17.5% / ‚Ä¢ Call 45.1% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 37.4%
 Against the HJ, the CO can 3-bet a wider range than vs the LJ because the HJ is opening
~21% hands, while LJ is opening only ~17% hands. You widen your 3-betting range to include
hands such as A9s (61%), QTs (30%), and JTs (16%) and by increasing weights in the other
threshold hands (Hand Range 60).
 Since your 3-betting range vs the HJ is wider, you need to defend a few extra hands against
the 4-bet to remain unexploitable, so now you also call KJs (100%), ATs (24%), and KTs (21%)
(Hand Range 61).
Hand Range 60: CO vs HJ Open
 ‚Ä¢ 3-bet 9.9% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 90.1%
 Hand Range 61: CO vs HJ 4-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 5-bet All-in 16.1% / ‚Ä¢ Call 48.2% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 35.8%
Button
The BN is the only position that doesn‚Äôt have to worry about being out of position post-flop if
someone else decides to enter the pot. Unlike the LJ, HJ, and CO, the BN has a calling range vs
opens, so the BN 3-betting range is more polarized (Diagram 14).
 Your flatting range is made of hands that have good post-flop playability and offer good board
coverage. You protect your calling range by slowplaying hands such as QQ (22%), JJ (52%), TT
(59%), 99 (72%), and AKo (23%), as well as hands that can call against squeezes and play post-
flop such as AQs (30%), AJs (37%), ATs (71%), KQs (65%), KJs (67%), KTs (30%) and QJs
(41%) (Hand Range 62).
 Hand Range 62: BN vs LJ Open
 ‚Ä¢ 3-bet 7.3% / ‚Ä¢ Call 6.9% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 85.8%
 When you see some singularities such as K6s-K5s and 53s in Hand Range 62 it‚Äôs important to
notice that these outliers are more likely to be due to convergence in the GTO solution than some
‚Äúgroundbreaking‚Äù discovery, so in practice you should be fine simply ignoring them.
 At this point, the LJ 4-betting range is strong enough that you are fine 5-betting a range of KK,
AKs, AKo (64%), AA (44%), and QQ (5%) from the BN as LJ should still continue ~58% of the
time vs the shove. Again, since you have position, the bulk of your range is defended by calling a
lot of hands that have good equity vs LJ 4-betting range (Hand Range 63).
 Hand Range 63: BN vs LJ 4-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 5-bet All-in 19.4% / ‚Ä¢ Call 40% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 40.6%
 Against HJ raises, the BN flatting frequency goes down a little bit because you now have a
little less protection against squeezes, given the blinds can 3-bet more vs the HJ than vs the LJ.
At the same time, the BN can 3-bet more vs the HJ, so your 3-betting frequency increases 1.5%
and your overall folding frequency decreases 1.2%. A few hands that get added to your 3-betting
range are strong blocker hands such as QJo (16%), and ATo (13%) (Hand Range 64).
 Against HJ 4-bets, the BN starts 5-betting QQ (38%) and incorporates more calling, using
hands such as AQo (66%), KTs, QJs (38%), JTs (96%), A5s (96%), A4s (40%), A3s (17%), and
54s (Hand Range 65).
 Hand Range 64: BN vs HJ Open
 ‚Ä¢ 3-bet 8.8% / ‚Ä¢ Call 6.5% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 84.6%
 Hand Range 65: BN vs HJ 4-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 5-bet All-in 18.4% / ‚Ä¢ Call 41.6% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 40%
 Notice that this chart only represents hand frequencies and not exactly how often the
 hand is in the range. So, for example, 54s should be read as a call 100% of the time when
 you have it, but if you look back at the BN vs the HJ 3-betting chart, 54s is only being 3-bet
 4% of the time, so you barely have it in your range when you face the 4-bet.
 Against a CO open, the BN calling range continues to shrink because the blinds will squeeze
more often vs the CO than vs the HJ and LJ. The BN 3-betting range vs the CO increases to
11.7% and the folding frequency decreases to 82.3%. The BN 3-betting range now incorporates
more suited Ax and offsuit broadways, focusing more on high card value (Hand Range 66).
 The CO 4-betting range is wider and a little more polarized than that of the HJ, so you can
defend more of your range by calling. At this point, AA slowplays 100% of the time. You also
increase the calling frequency of hands such as AQo, QJs, JTs, and K9s (68%). You begin to
incorporate 4-bets with JJ (40%) and increase the 4-betting frequency of hands such as AKo
(96%), and QQ (66%) (Hand Range 67).
 Hand Range 66: BN vs CO Open
 ‚Ä¢ 3-bet 11.7% / ‚Ä¢ Call 5.4% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 82.3%
 Hand Range 67: BN vs CO 4-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 5-bet All-in 17.1% / ‚Ä¢ Call 45.2% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 37.3%
Small Blind
From the SB vs the LJ, you play a 3-bet or fold strategy similar to play from the HJ and CO,
despite getting a discount on the call. Calling puts the SB in a bad situation where the BB
remains active and can squeeze, forcing SB off their equity. Alternatively, the BB can call and
realize their post-flop equity, capturing a portion of the pot. SB equity realization post-flop out of
position against two players is quite bad, particularly with high SPRs. All of this, combined with
the effect of the rake, makes calling from the SB a losing proposition (Hand Range 68).
 In response to a 4-bet, a good 5-betting range is AKs, AA (63%), AKo (53%), QQ (7%) and JJ
(10%). The calling range consists of all other pairs, suited connectors, AQs, AJs, ATs (21%) and
A5s (44%). Small suited connectors and mid pocket pairs make better calls than hands such as
AQo, Kxs, and Qxs because they unblock Villain‚Äôs bluffs even if they have less raw equity
(Hand Range 69).
 Hand Range 68: SB vs LJ Open
 ‚Ä¢ 3-bet 7.3% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 92.7%
 Hand Range 69: SB vs LJ 4-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 5-bet All-in 20.6% / ‚Ä¢ Call 45.7% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 33.8%
 The SB can 3-bet a wider range vs the HJ than vs the LJ, incorporating hands such as A9s
(23%), KQo (9%), K9s (10%), J9s (9%) and adding more weight to the threshold hands (Hand
Range 70).
 Since you are 3-betting slightly wider vs the HJ than vs the LJ, you have to call a little more
often vs the 4-bet to remain unexploitable by incorporating some calls with hands such as AQo
(5%), KQs (48%), KJs (54%), and KTs (28%) (Hand Range 71).
Hand Range 70: SB vs HJ Open
 ‚Ä¢ 3-bet 8.7% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 91.3%
 Hand Range 71: SB vs HJ 4-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 5-bet All-in 20%% / ‚Ä¢ Call 46.8% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 32.8%

 The SB can 3-bet 2.2% more hands vs the CO compared to the HJ by 3-betting hands such as
AJo (47%), A8s (15%), T9s (45%) and adding more weight to the threshold hands (Hand Range
72).
 The SB should slowplay AA slightly more frequently vs the CO because the CO 4-betting
range is more polarized than that of the HJ and the LJ, allowing you to call profitably with more
hands such as AQo (52%), A3s, and JTs (55%). Suited wheel Ax hands make better calls than
broadways and Ax with higher kickers such as A9s because they block AA and AK and unblock
bluffs such as KJs, KTs, K9s, J9s while retaining good post-flop playability. This is the point
where, for the first time, we see a 5-betting range include some non-premium hands as bluffs
such as ATs and A5s. The reason for this is that the EP and the MP 4-bet ranges are too strong
and too blocker heavy. The LP 4-bet ranges vs the blinds are less centered around blockers and
this starts to improve the EV of jamming these blocker-type hands. ATs and A5s are the highest
equity bluff hands against very strong ranges (Hand Range 73).
 Hand Range 72: SB vs CO Open
 ‚Ä¢ 3-bet 10.9% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 89.1%
 Hand Range 73: SB vs CO 4-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 5-bet All-in 18.6% / ‚Ä¢ Call 52.2% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 29.2%

 Against the BN, the SB can 3-bet 15% hands, adding hands such as ATo (43%), KTo (6%),
QJo (3%), A7s, Q9s, T8s (71%), 98s (21%), 87s (9%), 76s (86%) as well as giving more weight
to the threshold hands (Hand Range 74).
Hand Range 74: SB vs BN Open
 ‚Ä¢ 3-bet 15% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 85%
 Hand Range 75: SB vs BN 4-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 5-bet All-in 17.3% / ‚Ä¢ Call 56% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 26.5%

 The BN 4-betting range is very polarized, so the SB is less incentivized to 5-bet and more
incentivized to call, choosing to slowplay AA 100% of the time. The SB 5-betting range is KK,
QQ, AK, JJ (29%), TT (27%), and A5s (74%), while the calling range is 55+, 76s+ AQo, ATs+,
KTs+, A4s, A3s, AJo (37%), A9s (67%), A5s (74%), K9s (74%), QTs (72%), and K6s (Hand
Range 75).
Big Blind
Big blind defense strategies are probably the most important strategies to master, since most pots
play out with someone raising and the BB defending. If you were to fold all of your hands from
the BB, your Win Rate would be -100bb/100 from this position. Therefore, defending as many
hands as possible in a profitable manner will help reduce the money you lose in the blinds,
boosting your long-term winnings. Furthermore, if you fold too many hands from the BB, you
quickly become a target for aggressive players looking to steal, whereas if you defend
aggressively and play well post-flop, players will instead become wary of messing with your
blinds. Diagram 15 shows the frequencies with which the BB should defend.
 Against LJ opens, you need to defend tightly because the LJ opening range is quite strong.
There are not many speculative hands that will have the right equity and equity realization to call
profitably. Additionally, the LJ range can easily defend against 3-bets, so you can‚Äôt go too crazy
with 3-bet bluffs. Offsuit broadways such as AQo-ATo don‚Äôt make good 3-bets because you are
forced to fold them vs a 4-bet and their playability is generally poor in 3-bet pots, especially
from out of position. On the other hand, suited broadways are great 3-betting hands, followed by
suited Ax, Kx, suited connectors and suited gappers. The BB calling range consists mostly of the
best offsuit broadways, all other pocket pairs, suited connectors, suited gappers, Axs and Kxs
that are not 3-bet (Hand Range 76).
 It may be surprising that hands as strong as A9o always get folded whereas hands such as K2s
get called. The main reason for this is that offsuit disconnected hands tend to struggle to realize
equity, particularly when playing against tight ranges.
 When facing a LJ 4-bet, the BB 5-bets AA (61%), KK (57%), AKs, AKo (54%), QQ (16%)
and A5s (38%) and can call all other pairs, ATs+, JTs (75%), T9s-65s, and 54s (64%) (Hand
Range 77).
 Hand Range 76: BB vs LJ Open
 ‚Ä¢ 3-bet 5.8% / ‚Ä¢ Call 22.8% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 71.2%
 Hand Range 77: BB vs LJ 4-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 5-bet All-in 21.4% / ‚Ä¢ Call 42.2% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 36.4%
 Against HJ opens, the BB can defend a little wider than vs the CO and increase the 3-betting
frequency by adding weight to the threshold hands (Hand Range 78).
 The BB response to a HJ 4-bet is similar to the response to the LJ. The main difference is that
in order to maintain the proper defending frequency, you need to call a few more combos
because the 3-betting range vs the HJ is slightly wider than vs the LJ. You expand your calls to
include some hands such as KJs (52%), KTs (17%), while JJ gets 5-bet instead of QQ, probably
due to some blocker effects, although, as mentioned previously, these small singularities are not
something that should be a huge concern for the reader. Again, the strategies presented are to
help you develop a general idea of how to approach these common spots (Hand Range 79).
 Hand Range 78: BB vs HJ Open
 ‚Ä¢ 3-bet 7.6% / ‚Ä¢ Call 23.9% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 68.5%
 Hand Range 79: BB vs HJ 4-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 5-bet All-in 21% / ‚Ä¢ Call 42.5% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 36.5%
 Against the CO, the BB can defend 3.9% more hands. Both 3-bet and calling ranges get
slightly wider by adding more weight to the threshold hands. It is worth noting how many offsuit
hands such as K8o and Q9o simply get folded vs a CO open. As mentioned previously, offsuit
hands with low connectivity struggle to realize equity post-flop OOP, especially with deep stacks
(Hand Range 80).
 The CO 4-betting strategy vs the BB is a lot more polarized than the LJ and HJ strategy, so the
BB responds by calling more hands and slowplaying AA slightly more often (53%). The BB
calling range gets expanded by incorporating more hands such as KQs, 44, AQo (62%), A5s,
A9s (27%), and A4s (86%) (Hand Range 81).
 Hand Range 80: BB vs CO Open
 ‚Ä¢ 3-bet 9.7% / ‚Ä¢ Call 25.7% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 64.6%
 Hand Range 81: BB vs CO 4-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 5-bet 18.8% / ‚Ä¢ Call 49.6% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 31.5%
 Against the BN, the BB 3-bets a very linear range and plays in an overall more aggressive
manner compared to the strategy employed when facing the earlier positions. The BB now 3-bets
13.4% hands while calling with most suited hands, offsuit Ax, connectors and broadways. The
BN range is wide enough that now the BB can call many more hands compared to all the other
positions, as the BN‚Äôs ability to barrel and overbet very aggressively is downgraded due to the
strong hands being diluted (Hand Range 82).
 Hand Range 82: BB vs BN Open
‚Ä¢ 3-bet 13.4% / ‚Ä¢ Call 43.4% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 43.2%
 Hand Range 83: BB vs BN 4-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 5-bet All-in 19.4% / ‚Ä¢ Call 54.1% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 26.5%
 Against a BN 4-bet, the BB defends mostly by calling because the BN should be quite
polarized. The BB 5-betting strategy involves jamming AA (32%), AK, KK, QQ (55%), JJ
(32%), TT (31%), 99 (7%), A5s (45%), and A4s (43%). The calling range is expanded to include
hands that have great equity and equity realization vs the BN 4-betting range, such as A7s+,
K9s+, AQo, A5s-A3s, all suited connectors, and other pocket pairs (Hand Range 83).
 Due to being in position, the BB 3-betting strategy vs the SB open raise is very polarized,
including the best hands that can either 5-bet jam or are happy to call 4-bets in position. The rest
of the range consists of hands that have good blockers and good board coverage that don‚Äôt mind
being folded to a 4-bet, such as Axo and K4o+. The BB flat calling range consists mostly of
medium strength hands that can realize a lot of equity playing in position. The BB folding range
is made up of the absolute worst hands that really get punished by rake, making it impossible to
profit with them (Hand Range 84).
 Hand Range 84: BB vs SB Open

 Hand Range 85: BB vs SB 4-bet
 ‚Ä¢ 5-bet All-in 12.6% / ‚Ä¢ Call 46.2% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 41.2%
 The SB 4-betting range is very polarized. Since the BB has position, the SB is incentivized to
call many hands while 5-betting infrequently. They should slowplay hands such as AA (100%),
KK (65%), QQ (34%), AKs (87%) and JJ (28%) and call all hands that have some playability.
They should fold the bottom portion of their polar range (Hand Range 85).
 The BB wants to raise a semipolar range, with hands that can call in position vs a limp/raise
and hands that are easy raise/folds. The BB will only 4-bet about 7% of hands, mixing up strong
hands such as TT+, AK and some Ax and Kx blocker-type hands (Hand Range 86-87).

### TOPIC: THE THEORY OF POST-FLOP PLAY
The post-flop strategies and principles presented in this chapter are based on aggregated data
from thousands of GTO simulations, analyzed with custom made software. The ranges and
betting structure are representative of ante games with no rake reflecting a multi-table
tournament with stack depths 20bb to 40bb but the overall results and heuristics developed from
them are applicable to most NLH post-flop situations and can be extended to different stack
depths and other game variants.
 All the charts and metrics used in this chapter are generated from GTO solutions that are
representative of some of the most important post-flop situations, providing good approximations
that can help us better understand post-flop play. However, they are not a definite answer and
should not be taken as the final word when it comes to poker play in general. If you want to
know more about this please visit www.gtopoker.io.
 Post-flop can be divided into three streets; flop, turn and river. While entire books could be
written for each individual street even then we would not be close to discussing everything there
is to be said about post-flop play.
 I have done my best to organize the data in what seems to me to be a logical way. The
emphasis will be on finding patterns, spotting trends and developing heuristics that can be easily
recognized and applied in games across all three streets.

### TOPIC: Theory of Betting
Why do we bet in poker? If you ask around, most players do not really know how to answer this
question. Some people bet because they feel like it. Others might bet because they really like
their hand or because they sense weakness in their opponents and think they can get away with it.
Perhaps there are many possible draws on the flop and so they want to bet for protection. While
all these reasons may be somewhat valid, they are still far too subjective.
 Some professionals and people who watch training videos who are a bit more advanced will
tell you something like ‚Äúa bet has to be either for value (to get called by a worse hand) or a bluff
(to make a better hand than ours fold).‚Äù
 This definition sure sounds a lot more accurate than the previous ones, but is still incomplete
because there are many situations where betting is the correct play even if you will only get
called by better hands and will never make a better hand than yours fold.
 It is important tried to stop thinking about poker by categorizing bets as only bluffs or value-
bets because that only makes sense on the river if you have a perfectly polar range and are
betting against bluff-catchers. In all other situations, betting is more complex than that.
 Betting as a ‚Äúbluff‚Äù, ‚Äúfor value‚Äù, etc. are results of betting, not the reasons to bet. If you
 bet and your opponent calls with worse, you made a value-bet. If they fold a better hand
 than yours, you made a successful bluff.
 Those are just possible outcomes of betting your hands against a range distribution, and they
depend on the actual holding your opponent had at the time you made the bet, which is
something you don‚Äôt control. Thus, many times when you bet, you don‚Äôt know exactly if you are
value-betting or bluffing.
 If you think about betting in a more scientific and methodical way by applying game theory
concepts, you can reduce the reasons for betting to two primary concepts:
 Leveraging the advantage of knowing your own cards.
 Realizing equity or prevent your opponent‚Äôs equity realization.
Leverage the Advantage of Knowing Your Own Cards
In a GTO poker model it is assumed that your opponents know your full strategy. So, you are
never going to surprise a GTO opponent by holding something like 72o on the flop after you
open from UTG because if you did open 72o, it would be part of your UTG RFI range and your
GTO opponents will have full knowledge of that range. In that case, you should play only solid
ranges that won‚Äôt be easy to exploit even if the Villains have full knowledge of them.
 However, even in this GTO model you still have an informational advantage over your
 opponents. You know what exact cards you have whereas they only know your range. The
 informational advantage you have is the difference between your actual holdings and your
 range, and this informational advantage is valuable when the decision your opponent
 should make varies greatly depending on your exact holding.
 For example, imagine three different types of hands you could have in a given poker situation:
 Hand type A, Hand type B and Hand type C.
 Now imagine your opponent‚Äôs correct play is to:
 Fold when you hold a hand type A
 Call when you hold a hand type B
 Raise when you hold a hand type C
 If your betting range consists only of hands type A, your opponent‚Äôs play will be trivial. All
they have to do is always fold when you bet. Similar principles apply for the other types of
hands.
 By incorporating different types of hands in your ranges, you make it more difficult for your
opponents to consistently make the correct play against you. So, diversity of range increases your
informational advantage and makes it so that you can force your opponents into making
mistakes.
 A mistake is defined as a decision they would not have made if they could see your hole
 cards, not a decision that is bad against your range.
 This is a different type of mistake that does not happen when you play against a GTO
opponent who has perfect knowledge about your strategy.
 An example of a mistake a non-GTO player could make against your range would be when
you have a perfectly polarized range (hands with either 100% or 0% equity) and your opponent
goes all-in with a bluff catcher, making your play trivial. You simply call when you have the
winning hand and fold the losing hand every time. Giving your range composition, the Villain‚Äôs
correct play against your range should be to always check, then when you bet, he has to call with
some frequency depending on your bet-sizing. Sometimes Villain will call and lose when you are
value-betting and sometimes, Villain will fold when you are bluffing. This is the type of mistake
you can force a GTO player to make even when they have perfect information about your range
composition.
 Strong ranges are ranges where the informational advantage is very valuable and that is when
the Villain‚Äôs correct play varies drastically depending on what part of your range you are holding
at that specific time.
 Let‚Äôs recall the solution of the clairvoyance toy game with $100 stacks and a pot of $100. The
EV of the game for P1 is $75. Thinking about this game from an informational standpoint, P1
has perfect information, as the opponent‚Äôs range is exactly one hand, KK, and P2 has the worst
amount of information possible. They know Villain has equal probability of having two hands
and the correct action when facing a bet is the complete opposite depending on which of those
hands Villain holds.
 Now let‚Äôs imagine P1 had only one type of hand in their range, either the nuts or air. P2 would
again have an easy decision. In this case, the action of betting would not have any value at all
because P2 would never call a bet when P1 has AA and P2 would always call when P1 had QQ.
So again, P1 would never bet. In this case, each player‚Äôs EV would be $50, but in the original toy
game where P1‚Äôs range is 50% AA and 50% QQ, betting has value, and the way to measure the
value of having the option to bet for P1 is to compare the EV of the toy game with the option to
bet against the toy game where the option to bet is removed:
 In this toy game, the strategic option of betting for P1 has a value of $25 and the reason P1 is
able to extract value by betting is because of range composition. Furthermore, if the cards were
face-up, P2 would only call when seeing P1 has QQ and would never call when P2 has AA. If
the cards were face-up, betting would not make any sense and they might as well as check 100%
and realize 100% of their equity, resulting in an EV of $50 each.
 With the hands face-up, P1‚Äôs advantage disappears. The original solution to this game is for
P1 to bet 100% of the time with AA and 50% of the time with QQ, but P1 would not be able to
execute this strategy if playing face-up. All of the EV P1 gets from betting comes from this
asymmetrical information. There is no reason for P1 to bet except for the advantage gained by
knowing their hole cards and the fact that Villain does not.
 A similar thing happens when you play real poker and there are cards still to come. If you play
your range in a manner that effectively turns your hand face-up, your opponents could very
easily take advantage. For example, imagine your betting range is heavily unbalanced towards
flush draws on a two-tone flop. In that case, the correct play for the Villain would be to call the
bet, and then play very aggressively on blank turns. So, having range diversity can be extended
to a concept called board coverage. Having good board coverage means that your range can
make strong hands on a wide variety of runouts, or all of the possible runouts if you are playing
perfectly balanced strategies.
 The entire betting and raising dynamics in the game of poker revolve around this concept of
leveraging the informational advantage of knowing your hole cards and your opponents only
knowing your range. This is going to be the primary reason to bet.
 Every time you bet, you force your opponent to make a decision and since you get to
 decide what your betting range is, if you build it in a way that the correct decision against
 you is very different depending on which part of your range you hold, then your opponent
 will be unable to consistently make good decisions and, as a result, will lose EV.
 In general, you want to construct your betting range in such a way that your opponent cannot
possibly make the right decision consistently against all the different holdings in your range. You
want to create a big discrepancy between your opponent‚Äôs EV when they call and you hold hand
type A in your range compared to when they call and you hold hand type B or C in your range.
The same applies to raising. You want there to be a sizeable EV difference when they raise when
you have hand A in your range and when they raise and you have hand B or C in your range.
That is what makes a really strong betting range. The EV of folding is always 0, so in that case it
doesn‚Äôt matter.
Realize Equity or Prevent Villain‚Äôs Equity Realization
Returning one more time to the clairvoyance toy game where P1 has a polarized range and P2
had a condensed range. As mentioned before, in this example each player has 50% equity, but
P1‚Äôs EV will be determined by how big their bet can be, and since their bet-size will always be
all-in, their EV is directly proportional to stack depth.
 If P1‚Äôs stack is 10% of the pot, their EV will be $54.6. If their stack depth is 50% pot, their EV
increases to $66.7. With a pot-size bet, their EV increases to $75. With 2x pot, the EV is $83.5.
With 10x pot the EV is $95.4. The deeper the stacks are, the more effectively P1 can use range
construction to over-realize equity and hinder P2‚Äôs equity realization. So, in this toy game, it
doesn‚Äôt matter that P2 has 50% equity. If stacks are deep enough, P1 can always get away with
capturing more than their ‚Äúfair share‚Äù of the pot. Conversely, as stacks get shallower, P1
becomes less effective in denying P2 equity, which results in both players capturing a more even
share of the pot.
 Range composition is an important factor in determining how much more of their equity
players get to realize than raw equity.
 When stacks are deep, more streets are left to play and the better your opponent plays,
 the more range balance matters and the less raw equity matters. When stacks are short, all
 the money will usually go in pre-flop or on the flop which makes raw equity the dominant
 factor.
 As stacks get deeper, play will occur across multiple streets which increases the need for
constructing well-balanced ranges.
 Constructing sound post-flop betting strategies is not an easy task. Not only do you need to
preserve your informational advantage on the flop, but across all future streets too. Runout
coverage is essential for both betting and checking ranges. If you don‚Äôt have the right runout
coverage, even if your flop ranges are well constructed to make your opponent‚Äôs decision
difficult on the flop, they could still exploit you on later streets.
 Poker is a game of equity, how much you have and how to effectively realize it. Betting helps
realize equity because it denies your opponent‚Äôs equity and it also helps set up the SPR in a way
that can be beneficial to your equity realization. Range composition is always key to determine
optimal betting strategies. For this reason, in the next section, I introduce a new concept called
Equity Buckets that will help to better understand post-flop play dynamics.
Strategic Actions
Now that we understand the action of betting conceptually, we can take a closer look at the other
possible strategic actions of:
 Folding
 Checking
 Calling
 Raising
Folding
In game theory folding your hand when checking is free is a strictly dominated strategy and
should therefore never be used. Even if you think your hand is really bad and you know you will
be folding it to any future bets you should never proactively fold. Simply wait for your
opponents to make a bet before mucking your cards because no matter how bad your hand might
be, it will always have some equity or backdoor equity against most normal range distributions.
That equity can be realized if your opponents also check and allow free cards to be dealt. In
some cases, you might find decent spots to turn your hand into a bluff and take the pot down
later.
 Most importantly though, preserving the informational advantage you have over your
opponents is key. If every time you have a terrible hand you simply muck instead of checking,
then when you do not proactively fold, your opponents will know that you have a good hand and
will be able to adjust appropriately, only giving you action when they have a strong hand.
 Folding is a valid option only when facing a bet from an opponent and you assess that no other
strategic option (calling or raising) has a positive expectation.
Checking
Checking when in position is fundamentally different to checking when out of position.
Checking back the flop in position effectively removes one betting street from the game tree,
which benefits the weaker portions of IP‚Äôs range. When you are IP, checking your option
immediately realizes equity, either by seeing another card or by reaching showdown.
 In contrast, checking when OOP does not guarantee equity realization because many times the
OOP player will face a bet after checking and will be forced to fold some hands and forfeit
equity in the pot, making the need for range balance even greater when checking OOP compared
to IP. IP‚Äôs checking range only has to be balanced on the average turn card, while OOP‚Äôs
checking range has to be balanced on the flop so it can deal with possible IP bets.
Calling
Calling a bet in a heads-up pot realizes equity, either by reaching showdown or seeing another
card.
Raising
Raising a bet is effectively putting a bet on top of a previous bet, so the same principles that
apply to betting also apply to raising. You only want to make a raise to leverage the advantage of
knowing your hole cards or if raising can help you effectively realize equity or deny your
opponent‚Äôs equity realization.
 All the different actions you take convey information. Once you take an action, you can only
hold hands that would be present in the range that takes that action. One of the biggest mistakes I
see rookies make is trying to represent a hand that they clearly can never have given the way the
action has played out. This is why it is important not only to be able to hand read your opponents
correctly, but also to be aware of your own ranges and make sure to keep them well-balanced.
 If the story your opponent is trying to tell you doesn‚Äôt make sense, they probably don‚Äôt
 have it.

### TOPIC: Equity Buckets (EQB)
Earlier in Chapter 1 we discussed range morphology, and mentioned three main range shapes:
 Linear range
 Polarized range
 Condensed range
 We also established that a range can be capped or uncapped and that most ranges will fit into
one or more categories at the same time. While this way of categorizing the ranges works well
for most pre-flop situations and can be used to get a general idea of a range‚Äôs equity distribution,
it lacks a level of detail.
 As we have seen in the game theory section, range composition is one of the most important
factors that drives the action. For this reason, I am introducing a new concept called Equity
Buckets, shifting the focus from the way ranges are categorized according to their general equity
distribution to the way hands within a given range can be categorized according to their hand vs
range equity. This gives us the required level of detail to help us better understand post-flop play:
 Strong Hands: Hands with a hand vs range equity greater or equal to 75%
 Good Hands: Hands with a hand vs range equity greater or equal to 50% but lower than
 75%
 Weak Hands: Hands with a hand vs range equity greater or equal to 33% but lower than
 50%
 Trash Hands: Hands with a hand vs range equity lower than 33%
 By putting each hand in a player‚Äôs range into an equity bucket, we get a clearer idea of the
range‚Äôs post-flop equity distribution and can be more precise about the degree to which a range
fits within the different morphologies. It is important to emphasize how a hand‚Äôs value is not
static but instead dynamic, relative to the ranges in play and the board type (Table 88).
 We can see how a hand such as top pair can be strong with 82% EQ on the AQT flop but has
only 60% EQ on the single suited T98 flop. A hand such as two pair on AQT has more equity
than a set on T98.
BB vs IP Equity Buckets (All flops)
Average UTG vs BB and BN vs BB Flop Equity Buckets for GTO MTT Ranges with stack
depths 20, 30 and 40bbs (Diagrams 23 and 24).
 According to the EQB Charts across all 1,755 flops, almost half of the BB range is made of
trash hands that have less than 33% equity, while the IP Player (BN-UTG) has on average only
6% of trash hands in their range. On the other hand, the IP Player has 22% strong hands that
have at least 75% equity, while only about 7% of the BB range are strong hands. Both players
have a similar number of weak hands, 23% for the BB and 29% for IP. Finally, the IP Player‚Äôs
range has 43% good hands while the BB has only 25%.

### TOPIC: Post-flop Bet-sizing
The main thing that sets NLH apart from other poker games is the ability to bet any amount,
from a single big blind to your entire stack, at any given point. When we discussed complex
strategies in Chapter 4 we proved that playing a more complex strategy than push or fold gains
Hero EV. The following questions are interesting:
 How important is it to have the ability to use several bet-sizes post-flop?
 How many bet-sizes do we need?
 Does true GTO play require the use of an infinite number of bet-sizes, or is there a cap to
 the EV gained by adding multiple bet-sizes and increasing the complexity of our
 strategy?
 Could it be the case that there is a GTO optimal bet-size that will always maximize our
 EV?
 NLH is a continuous game in the sense that the full game tree with infinite bet-sizes cannot be
drawn. So, in order to computationally solve any given NLH situation with modern GTO
Solvers, we must use a betting abstraction with a finite number of bet-sizes. If true optimal play
requires the use of an infinite or very large number of bet-sizes, then computational solver
applications would be quite limited, or even useless. Furthermore, as mentioned before, the cost
of implementing extremely complex strategies can surpass the value they add and can, in
practice, hurt your expectation because more complex strategies are more difficult to execute.
Unlike computers, for us humans, even more than a few bet-sizes across multiple streets quickly
gets out of hand.
 In this section we will use results from known toy games and modern solvers to answer these
questions, improving our understanding of GTO bet-sizing and use the results to develop
strategies that are both powerful and simple enough to be effectively implemented.
The Pot-size Raise
The pot-size bet or pot-size raise is a bet that lays exactly 2-to-1 or 33% pot odds to your
opponent. Betting the size of the pot is widely used in Pot Limit Omaha (PLO) as the biggest
possible bet or raise players can make. For this reason, PLO players are probably going to be
more familiar with it than NLH players.
 The way to calculate a pot-size bet is straightforward. Imagine the pot is $100, and you want
to bet 1/2-pot. All you have to do is multiply $100 √ó 1/2 = $50. But this gets a bit trickier if you
want to make a pot-size raise after someone else has already made a bet.
 To calculate a pot-sized raise, follow this formula:
 Match the previous bet.
 Calculate the total pot including your matching bet before you raise.
 Add that amount on top of your matching bet.
Example
The pot is $100 and Villain bets $50, how much should you raise if you want to make a pot-size
raise?
 If you want to raise to a fraction of the pot, the formula would be as follows:
 Full pot = 100%, so the pot-size raise stays the same:
 If you want to raise a different amount such as 50% pot, then the calculation would be:
 A 25% pot size raise would be:
Alpha and MDF Revisited
EV has to be compared between all the different actions a player can take and never in a vacuum.
I‚Äôve seen many top players, and even famous poker coaches, making the mistake of using the
Alpha Number and MDF to justify making bad plays. The discussion often goes something like
this:
 ‚ÄúMy flop bet is profitable, it only has to work X% of the time and the Villain is folding
 more than that, therefore I‚Äôm making money!‚Äù
 While that statement might be true, we cannot forget where Alpha and MDF numbers come
from. They are derived from the EV equation. They assume that the EV of checking back your
hand is 0 and that every time you are called and hold a bluff that you lose the pot and your bet.
However, on the flop most poker hands will almost always have some equity as even the worst
hands can improve on future streets. For this reason, the Alpha and MDF numbers are
misleading. In reality, the BB does not have to defend nearly as many hands as MDF suggests,
because they do not have to make IP‚Äôs worst hands indifferent to 0. IP has to make them
indifferent to the EV of checking back. Also, IP won‚Äôt always lose the entire pot when they are
called and hold a bluff because sometimes this bluff will pick up equity which makes the
continuation bets more profitable than expected.
 These numbers become more relevant on the river when there are no more cards to come and
you know if your hand has some equity in the pot or not. When deciding whether to bet or check
a hand, you need to compare the EV of both actions and take the action you think will yield a
higher expectation.
 Alpha and MDF can be used as a rough guide, but you cannot build your core strategy
 based solely on them and think it is GTO.

### TOPIC: Splitting Your Range Into Multiple Bet-sizes
How many bet-sizes do you need on any given flop? Should you split your range as much as
possible by betting different amounts according to hand strength?
The [0-1] Toy game
The [0-1] Toy Game can be used to analyze a heads-up situation when both players have
symmetrical ranges. In this game, both players get dealt a random number between 0 and 1
(including decimals such as .04563) that represent their hand. Higher numbers beat lower
numbers. This game is played across a single street. OOP always checks to IP who can bet or
check. If IP bets, OOP can only call or fold, and cannot x/r.
 In this set-up, both players can have an infinite number of hands as there are infinite numbers
between 0 and 1. The general result is that the optimal strategy for IP is to use an infinite number
of bet-sizes based on the strength of their value hands. So IP should pick a value hand, say 0.99,
and pair it up with a bluff chosen from one of the weakest hands in the range, say 0.01. IP then
bets a specific amount that varies with the strength of the value hand, using the biggest bet-size
with the strongest value hand, the second biggest bet-size with the second strongest value hand,
the third biggest bet-size with the third strongest value hand and so on.
 We can replicate the [0-1] Toy Game in a modern GTO solver by giving both players a fixed
range of 10 hands carefully selected so there are no blocker effects:
Hero: IP with a range of A‚ô£A, K‚ô£K, Q‚ô£Q, J‚ô£J, T‚ô£T, 9‚ô£9, 8‚ô£8, 7‚ô£7, 6‚ô£6, 5‚ô£5
Villain: OOP with a range of A‚ô†A‚ô•, K‚ô†K‚ô•, Q‚ô†Q‚ô•, J‚ô†J‚ô•, T‚ô†T‚ô•, 9‚ô†9‚ô•, 8‚ô†8‚ô•, 7‚ô†7‚ô•, 6‚ô†6‚ô•,
5‚ô†5‚ô•
The board: 2‚ô•2‚ô†23‚ô†3‚ô• so there is no interference with the ranges.
Stack depth: 2x Pot
Bet-sizes: full pot, 2/3-pot and 1/3-pot.
 In this experiment we get the same results as the [0-1] Toy Game predicts with Hero‚Äôs
strongest hand AA using the biggest bet-size, KK using the second biggest bet-size and finally
QQ using the smallest bet-size and balancing it out with 55, and 66 using all three-bet-sizes (the
fraction of 55 in the range is not enough to make up all the bluffing frequency so a small portion
of 66 is used to make up the difference). JJ-77 are always checked.
 The Villain‚Äôs response in this toy game is to always call AA against all bet-sizes, then add
enough of all other hands to make IP bluffs indifferent to a bet or check.
[0-1] Toy Game Example A
However, this toy game has some limitations that real poker does not have. For example, in real
poker, your opponents can raise your bets so, if you use the 1/3-pot bet-size, they will know you
can only have QQ or 55 and use that information to attack your capped range by raising with a
range that is polarized against that distribution, for example AA, KK and some bluffs. This will
allow the Villains to pick up extra EV (Hand Range 337).
 Hand Range 337: No x/r allowed ‚Ä¢ Bet Full Pot 15% / ‚Ä¢ Bet 2/3 Pot 14% / ‚Ä¢ Bet 1/3 Pot 15%/ ‚Ä¢
 Check 56%
[0-1] Toy Game Example B
If the Villain is allowed to x/r against the 1/3-pot bet-size, they can leverage the information
Hero is giving to take advantage of Hero‚Äôs range construction. So, Hero immediately adjusts to
never use that bet-size and QQ will shift entirely to the 2/3-pot bet-size (Hand Range 338).
Hand Range 338: OOP x/r vs the 1/3 Bet-size ‚Ä¢ Bet Full Pot 15% / ‚Ä¢ Bet 2/3 Pot 28% / ‚Ä¢ Bet 1/3
 Pot 0%/ ‚Ä¢ Check 57%
[0-1] Toy Game Example C
If we allow a x/r against all three different bet-sizes, Hero is no longer able to split their range
into multiple bet-sizes and will adjust to only use the full pot-size bet, shrinking the value range
to KK+ and checking back QQ-66 (Hand Range 339).
Hand Range 339: OOP x/r allowed vs all bet-sizes ‚Ä¢ Bet Full Pot 30% / ‚Ä¢ Bet 2/3 Pot 0% / ‚Ä¢ Bet
 1/3 Pot 0%/ ‚Ä¢ Check 70%
[0-1] Toy Game Example D
If we give Hero the option to go all-in and to additionally bet pot while the Villain is allowed to
x/r, Hero will indeed split their range into the two bet-sizes:
 The all-in bet-size is used by AA 42% of the time and balanced by bluffing with 55 26%
 of the time.
 The full pot bet-size is used by KK 100% of the time and is balanced with AA 58% of the
 time, which gives IP protection from OOP x/r and with 55 74% of the time as a bluff.
 All-in is a special bet-size because it limits the Villain‚Äôs options to only call and fold. At this
2x pot stack depth, OOP cannot effectively use the information given by Hero for exploitation.
 Hand Range 340: IP All-in allowed (2x Pot) ‚Ä¢ Bet All-in 7% / ‚Ä¢ Bet Pot 24% / ‚Ä¢ Check 69%
 If we increase the SPR to 3, Hero never goes all-in and reverts back to using only the full pot
bet-size. With an SPR of 3, bluffing with 55 starts to become too expensive as OOP‚Äôs range is
strong enough to defend effectively (Hand Range 340).
Summary
 In Toy Game A, when the Villain is not allowed to x/r, Hero can split the betting range
between three different bet-sizes which allows capture of 56.11% of the pot.
 In Toy Game B if we allow the Villain to x/r only against the 1/3-pot bet-size, Hero‚Äôs response
is to stop using that bet-size and their EV will reduce to 54.98%. If we lock Hero‚Äôs strategy in
Toy Game B to force the use of the 1/3-pot bet-size, even though it can be exploited by the
Villain‚Äôs x/r, Hero‚Äôs EV reduces to 54%.
 In Toy Game C, Hero reverts to a single bet-size due to exploitation by OOP x/r.
 In Toy Game D, Hero‚Äôs stack depth allows them to split their range into an all-in and pot-size
bet when the SPR is 2, which grants a small EV gain for a total EV of 55.06%. However, Hero‚Äôs
EV is virtually the same as in toy game C which only uses the pot-size bet. If we increase the
SPR to 4 in toy game D, Hero won‚Äôt be using the all-in bet-size any more and chooses to use
only the pot-size bet and there is no EV loss by restricting Hero to only the pot-size bet.
 Limiting Hero to using only the pot-size bet retains EV, while limiting to the 1/3-pot size bet
only reduces Hero‚Äôs EV to 53.27%. So, choosing the wrong bet-size loses EV.
SPR Effect
Testing various SPR results on Hero‚Äôs strategy shows a preference for the following bet-sizes
(Table 90).
 If the SPR is 1 or less, the optimal bet-size is in fact all-in.
 For SPR 1-2 the range gets split between pot and all-in.
 For SPR 3 the all-in bet stops being used and the betting range gets split between 75% pot
 and 125% pot
 For SPR 5 to 10 the betting range gets split between 75% pot and 150% pot.
 If we simplify Hero‚Äôs strategy in the [0-1] Single Street Toy Game by removing the least
frequently used bet-size from the game tree across all SPRs, leaving Hero with a single bet-size
option, the EV loss diminshes as the SPR decreases and the average EV loss across all SPRs is
0.21% of the pot (Table 91).
Conclusion
Using multiple bet-sizes is dangerous and it‚Äôs more dangerous in the early betting rounds.
Splitting your range into different bet-sizes gives away information that your opponents could
leverage against you when they have the option to raise or bet. This effect gets magnified when
betting happens across multiple streets. The way ranges interact with the board and cards to
come shift equities, as is the case of real poker. When the board runout can change the hand‚Äôs
value and there are possible blocker effects by the board or Villain‚Äôs hands blocking value hands
or bluffs, fewer bet-sizes should be used.
 For this reason we don‚Äôt have to worry about optimal play containing infinite bet-sizes
because there is always going to be a tradeoff between the possible EV gained by using the
perfect bet-size with a specific portion of your range and how much you lose by giving your
opponents additional information about your holdings.
 Even if GTO solvers can manage to split and balance out multiple bet-sizes the EV gained by
doing so is not, in most cases, substantial enough to warrant the increased difficulty for a human
player to implement them.
 I tested many different bet-sizes on thousands of post-flop GTO simulations across all 1,755
flops and found that most flops will have one or two dominant bet-sizes. If the bet-sizes are close
to each other, for example 25% pot or 33% pot, they will have virtually identical EVs, making
the solver indifferent between them. If the solver splits a player‚Äôs range evenly between two
similar bet-sizes, the game tree can be simplified by removing the lower frequency bet-size and
keeping only the higher frequency bet-size with no EV loss because most of the time the EV
difference is within the Nash distance. The same thing can be done if one bet-size is very
dominant and the solver chooses several other bet-sizes infrequently. The low frequency bet-
sizes can be removed from the game tree and the new strategy that only uses the higher
frequency bet-size will preserve the EV. Finally, if the solver splits its range between two bet-
sizes that are very far apart, both bet-sizes can be replaced by another bet-size that is in the
middle.
 Simplifying a strategy by removing the smaller bet-sizes and leaving only large ones typically
lowers the player‚Äôs overall betting frequency as many hands that are profitable bets with the
smaller bet-size might no longer be profitable bets with the larger bet-size. Conversely, removing
the large bet-sizes from the simulation leaves only small ones, which generally boosts the
player‚Äôs betting frequency.
 Both theory and practice agree with the premise that splitting your range into multiple
 bet-sizes does not add substantial EV to your strategy against a GTO opponent who can
 react properly. However, changing your bet-size exploitatively with different parts of your
 range against a player you think will be prone to making mistakes can be extremely
 profitable.
Optimal Bet-size
Is there an optimal bet-size that will always maximize your EV?
 Bet-sizing is affected by the range‚Äôs polarization and the number of streets left to play. Earlier
in Chapter 2, we went over the Clairvoyance Single Street Toy Game that shows how, with a
purely polarized range vs a bluff-catcher range, the optimal bet-size is to bet all of your chips,
and the optimal bet-size for the player with the depolarized range is to bet 0 chips (always
check).
 In the [0-1] Single Street Toy game, we saw that the optimal bet-size when the players‚Äô ranges
are symmetrical was to bet big but since both players have the exact same range there is a cap as
to how big the bets can be and that cap depends on the SPR. But NLH is played across multiple
streets, so how would playing across multiple streets affect the play in these toy games?
Geometrical Bet-sizing
The optimal bet-size that maximizes EV for the player with the polarized range on the multi-
street version of the Clairvoyance Toy game is given by the geometrical growth of the pot. This
implies a betting structure where the same fraction of the pot is bet on each street so that the river
bet is always all-in.
 The general formula to find the final pot size after a number of betting streets is given by:
Where:
FP = Final Pot Size
SP = Starting Pot Size
R = Pot Growth Rate
S = Number of Betting Streets
 Which can be rearranged to find the Pot growth rate (R) that can later be used to find the
Geometrical Bet-size. (The proof of this concept goes beyond the scope of this text. If you want
to expand on it you can find more details in The Mathematics of Poker by Bill Chen and Jerrod
Ankenman.)
Example
Game: Live Cash game
Stacks: Hero $1,900, Villain: $1,000
Players: 9
Blinds: $5/$10 (no ante)
Pre-flop: Action folds to Hero in the SB who raises to $35, the Villain in the BB calls, and we
get to the flop. How much should Hero bet on each street if wanting to use the geometrical bet-
size?
 We need to figure out the pot growth rate (R). In this example the betting is calculated across
three streets starting on the flop, so the starting pot is $70, the final pot size when both players
are all-in will be $2,000 and the number of betting streets is 3.
 First we calculate the pot growth rate (R):
 Then the geometrical bet-size is given by:
 If Hero wants to use the geometrical bet-size, it is necessary to slightly overbet the pot on each
street:
 It‚Äôs important to notice that implementing the geometrical bet-size when stacks are very deep
results in very large bets (often these are overbets). In real poker, the ranges will never be
perfectly polarized and betting too large forces the Villain to fold the weaker portions of their
range and only continue with the strongest hands. If you bet large enough to make the Villain
only call when you are beat, you won‚Äôt be able to value-bet any more because betting will lose
you money. Thus, there is a cap to the bet-size Hero can use across multiple streets. Particularly
when stacks are deep, this cap will be lower than the geometrical bet-size.
 The geometrical bet-size only applies for situations when one player‚Äôs range is perfectly polar
(made of hands with 100% equity and hands with 0% equity) and the other player‚Äôs range is
100% bluff-catchers, which will never be the case in real poker. So, it is unlikely that the
geometrical bet-size will be optimal for Hero, but it at least gives us a good general idea of what
Hero‚Äôs strategy should be when their range is polarized: big bets across multiple streets!
Range Polarization Effect
We now return to the [0-1] Single Street Toy Game with the following set up:
The board: 2‚ô•2‚ô†22‚ô£3‚ô•
The SPR: 4
Bet-sizes: 30% Pot, 60% Pot, 90% Pot, 120% Pot, All-in
Hero: IP
Villain: OOP
 In this toy game Villain always checks to Hero, but is allowed to raise if Hero bets. In this
setup both players always have 50% equity.
[0-1] Toy Game A: Hero Has a Big Polarization Disadvantage
Hero‚Äôs range is QQ, JJ, TT, 99, 88, 77, 66
Villain‚Äôs range is AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, 99, 88, 77, 66, 55, 44
[0-1] Toy Game B: Hero Has a Slight Polarization Disadvantage
Hero‚Äôs range is KK, QQ, JJ, TT, 99, 88, 77, 66, 55
Villain‚Äôs range is AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, 99, 88, 77, 66, 55, 44
[0-1] Toy Game C: Symmetric Ranges
Hero‚Äôs range is AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, 99, 88, 77, 66, 55, 44
Villain‚Äôs range is AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, 99, 88, 77, 66, 55, 44
[0-1] Toy game D: Villain Has a Slight Polarization Disadvantage
Hero‚Äôs range is AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, 99, 88, 77, 66, 55, 44
Villain‚Äôs range is KK, QQ, JJ, TT, 99, 88, 77, 66, 55
[0-1] Toy game E: Villain Has a Big Polarization Disadvantage
Hero‚Äôs range is AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, 99, 88, 77, 66, 55, 44
Villain‚Äôs range is QQ, JJ, TT, 99, 88, 77, 66
 Hero‚Äôs EV increases as they gain the polarization advantage (Table 92). The smaller size 30%
Pot is never used and the bigger bet-sizes are increasingly used as Hero‚Äôs range gains the
polarization advantage.
 Toy Game A (Hero‚Äôs range is very depolarized): The strategy is to always check and
 simply split the pot 50% of the time.
 Toy Game B (Hero‚Äôs range is slightly depolarized): Hero can start betting ~15% of the
 time using the 60% bet-size with the bigger bet-sizes not being used.
 Toy Game C (the ranges are symmetric): Hero‚Äôs range gets split among the bigger bet-
 sizes of 90% and 120% but all-in is still not used.
 Toy game D (Hero starts to have a slight polarization advantage): the all-in bet-size
 starts to get used, but the dominant bet-size is the 120% overbet.
 Toy Game E (Hero has a large polarization advantage): all-in becomes by far the
 dominant bet-size, with the small and medium bet-sizes never used.
 If Hero‚Äôs range becomes perfectly polarized and the Villain‚Äôs becomes bluff -catchers only,
the strategies will result in Hero only using the all-in bet-size.
Multi-street Betting
[0-1] Multi-street Toy Game
The board: 2‚ô•2‚ô†22‚ô£ (turn play)
The SPR: 4
Bet-sizes: 30% Pot, 60% Pot, 90% Pot, 120% Pot, All-in
Hero: IP
Villain: OOP
 In this toy game Villain checks to Hero on the turn but is allowed to raise if Hero bets. Both
players can bet, raise, call or fold on the river.
 Using the same range distribution examples as in the Range Polarization Effect section, we get
the following range polarization stats (Table 93).
 In this set-up, Hero not only has the polarization advantage, but also has equity advantage, so
the expectation is even bigger than in the single street toy game. Also, betting across multiple
streets is always beneficial for the player with the polarized range.
 In Toy Games A and B, Hero has the depolarized range. In the single street toy game Hero
was still able to bet with a small frequency when we removed KK and 44 from their range. Here,
however, in the multi-street version of the game, even a slight polarization disadvantage is
enough to stop Hero from doing any betting at all. Despite having position, Hero chooses to
never bet, as checking back effectively removes one betting street from the game tree, allowing
Hero to get to the river with their full range. Meanwhile betting would result in Hero having to
fold some hands to a x/r. Going all-in will not help Hero either because Villain‚Äôs range is
stronger than Hero‚Äôs range and putting in very large bets with the weaker range is a losing
proposition.
 In Toy Game C, the ranges are symmetric and Hero starts using the smaller bet-size of 30%
Pot for the first time. As Hero gets the polarization advantage, the overall betting frequency
increases, and the bigger bet-sizes are implemented. With SPR 4, the geometrical bet-size with
two betting streets is 100% pot, but the bet-sizes chosen by the solver are far smaller than that, so
Hero‚Äôs range has to be even more polarized compared to the Villain for the bigger bet-sizes to
become dominant.
 In Toy Game E, Hero‚Äôs strategy is to bet small on the turn with a high frequency, combining
the polarized and depolarized portions of their range. This action is often referred to as range
merging. The reason Hero chooses to bet a merged range instead of a polarized range is the
Villain‚Äôs ability to bet the river. If Hero polarizes their betting range too much on the turn,
choosing big bet-sizes with the top and bottom of their range, opting to check back middling
hands such as TT-88, then Villain has the option to bet the river and attack Hero‚Äôs capped range
and thus to increase expectation. By betting a merged range for a smaller bet-size on the turn,
Hero gets to increase their betting frequency, minimizing the effect of checking back a weak
capped range. Furthermore, after Villain has called the turn bet, Villain will mostly check to
Hero who will then be able to check back middling strength hands, realizing their equity.
 If we increase Hero‚Äôs polarization advantage by shrinking the Villain‚Äôs range to JJ-77 (Toy
Game F), Hero will be able to bet 100% of their range on the turn. The 30% bet-size remains the
highest frequency bet-size, but the middling 60% bet-size starts to disappear, while the 90% bet-
size frequency increases and Hero even starts tapping into the 120% overbet (Table 94).
Conclusion
The more polarized Hero‚Äôs range is compared to Villain‚Äôs range, the more they are incentivized
to use bigger bet-sizes. If betting can happen across multiple streets, Hero is more likely to
choose smaller bet-sizes on the early streets and choose to bet a merged range, waiting until
future streets to start polarizing their betting range, unless they have a very substantial
polarization advantage. In that case, their bet-size will approach the geometrical bet-size unless
the SPR is very high because of the threat of the Villain‚Äôs range containing traps, which reduces
the profitability of making large bets. For this reason, all-in bets are rarely used on early streets
unless stacks are shallow.
Bet-sizing Based on Runout
We already know that you don‚Äôt need to split your range into different bet-sizes on the flop, but
should you have different bet-sizes for different flops?
 Different flops will have a different effect on the ranges‚Äô equities and polarization. Our test
with the [0-1] Toy Game proves that bet-size is affected by the range polarization and also that
using the wrong bet-size can cost EV. This suggests that GTO play on different types of flops
will involve the use of flop-specific bet-sizes.
 To test this hypothesis I ran all 1,755 flops in a Single Raised Pot (SRP) BB vs BN scenario
with 40bbs effective stacks. In one simulation I used four different bet-sizes: min-bets, 1/3-pot,
1/2-pot and 2/3-pot, and got IP average EV across all flops accounting for each flop‚Äôs individual
weight, in order to represent all 22,100 specific flops (accounting for suits). Then I re-ran the
same scenario using only the 1/3-pot size. The results are summarized in Table 95.
 The average EV difference across all flops is -0.14% of the pot, or 0.9 bb/100, when using a
single bet-size compared to using four-bet-sizes. However, this test compares the single bet-size
simulation to a simulation that has four-bet-sizes and can maximize the EV of each individual
combo by choosing any of the four available bet-sizes. This is different than running each one of
the 1,755 simulations using only the best of the four-bet-sizes for each flop. Still, if I had done
that, the EV of using only the ‚Äúoptimal bet-size‚Äù among the four options cannot be higher than
the EV of using 4 bet-sizes that maximized each combo‚Äôs EV because if that is the case, the
solver will only choose one of them even when having four options to choose from. At most, the
EV of solving each flop with only one optimal bet-size has to be the same as the EV of a
simulation that has all four-bet-sizes.
 Assuming perfect play from each player, the average EV loss using only the 1/3-pot size in the
tested set up is at most 0.9bb/100. This number could change with different stack depths and
different ranges, but it gives us a reasonable starting point, since this is the average across all
1,755 flops. It is not the same as if it was -0.9bb/100 lost on a single flop, so this number is very
significant. However, it assumes perfect play from both players and we know that is far away
from real poker, as both Hero and Villain will make mistakes.
 Some people advocate for oversimplifying their strategies with a ‚Äúsingle bet-size fits all‚Äù
approach based on the premise that adjusting the bet-size according to the flop is not worth the
hassle, given the small, if any, EV to be gained when compared to using a reasonable bet-size
across all 1,755 flops. While I understand this reasoning, I don‚Äôt agree with the ‚Äúsingle bet-size
fits all‚Äù approach. Yes, there might not be too much EV to be won against a GTO player when
changing your bet-size on different flops. However, you won‚Äôt be playing against a GTO player.
Putting in the extra effort to understand how some flops are different to others and what bet-size
to use makes more sense. Given the way ranges interact with the board will not only make your
hand easier to play, but it will also make life more difficult for your opponents who might not be
used to facing different bet-sizes. Even if the GTO player could defend with the exact calling,
folding and raising frequencies to make your bet-sizes indifferent or just slightly better than the
‚Äústandard‚Äù bet-size, that might not be the case for your human opponents who could struggle to
defend against non-standard lines. You won‚Äôt have that problem. If your opponent uses the GTO
bet-size or close to it against you, you have a very good idea of how to defend. If your opponent
uses a non-GTO bet-size, then you can try to exploit this suboptimal bet-size selection.
Example
You are in the BB with a 30bb effective stack, UTG min-raises, the action folds to you and you
call. The flop comes J‚ô†2‚ô•2 and you check.
 On a paired flop such as J22, UTG‚Äôs GTO play when checked to is to min-bet the flop 100%
of the time and this will generate an EV of 77.05. If your opponent instead makes a 2/3-pot bet,
they can no longer continuation bet their entire range, because if they do, then you will be able to
exploit them by switching to a x/r only strategy which will make the Villain‚Äôs EV diminish to
71.01. If they are a good player and lower their C-bet frequency to match the new equilibrium,
they should be c-betting the flop 42.45% of the time and their EV will be 74.10. If this player is
good enough to know what a good 1/3-pot GTO c-betting strategy looks like from UTG vs BB
on J22, why are they using a suboptimal strategy that loses EV instead of simply going for the
GTO line? Chances are they are not c-betting at a GTO frequency for that bet-size and their
range is probably going to be highly unbalanced, so there might be even more room for
exploitation.
 To make money playing poker, you don‚Äôt need to play perfect GTO in every single line
 and to know the absolute optimal bet-size on any given flop because your opponents are not
 playing perfect GTO themselves. All you have to do is make, on average, better decisions
 than them, enough to create a solid win rate, and keep improving so they don‚Äôt catch up to
 you.
 Most of the time the solver is indifferent to similar bet-sizes. For example, there probably isn‚Äôt
too much difference between betting 25% or 33% Pot, or 60% or 67% Pot. Most of the time it is
good enough to know if the flop is a ‚Äúbig bet-size‚Äù flop or ‚Äúsmall bet-size‚Äù flop. For MTTs, I
recommend using two c-bet sizes: 1/3-pot, and 2/3-pot. If you want to play a more complex
strategy, you could add min-bets and 120% overbets to the mix. If you want to simplify your
strategy to only one bet-size, you could opt for the 1/3-pot across the board, which is in fact what
most online MTT regulars are doing in modern games. This strategy works fine against the
population as it simplifies the game tree, is really easy to implement, and it allows you to c-bet at
a high frequency on most boards. This forces Villains into making a decision, revealing
information about their range at a low cost. It also exploits population tendencies, as most people
still overfold to small bets.
 My recommendation is to become proficient with at least a couple bet-sizes (a big one and a
small one), and to understand how to implement them correctly. They you have a solid strategy
you can play against tough opponents to keep them guessing while also being able to defend well
when they are the ones using non-standard lines. Against weaker players, you can mix it up and
play an exploitative strategy. Don‚Äôt be afraid of being counter-exploited when playing against
unaware opponents because even if they knew what you are doing, chances are they won‚Äôt know
how to properly adjust to counter you. Keep hammering on them until they start fighting back. If
you think you can get away with c-betting at a higher frequency than optimal against a Villain or
manipulate them into folding or calling with your bet-size, then go for it! Always be aware and
mindful of the situation you are in.

### TOPIC: Bet-sizing and Modern Solvers
Modern GTO solvers can be set up to solve for a specific spot with several bet-sizes, but it is up
to the user to input those bet-sizes. A GTO solver cannot figure out the optimal bet-sizes by itself
and build the game tree for us. That job is left to the user, so it is up to us to use our knowledge
and expertise as poker players to input bet-sizes that we think are a good representation of the
situation we want to model and solve the game tree within those parameters.
 When you choose the bet-sizes a player can use in any given spot, you are limiting their
actions to only those options. For example, if you input flop bet-sizes of 1/2-pot and 2/3-pot,
those are the only bet-sizes the player can use on the flop. As another example, if you don‚Äôt give
the OOP player the option to x/r the flop, if they can only call or fold, that will have an effect on
IP Betting strategy as IP now knows there is a 0% chance OOP will x/r the flop. IP is now
incentivized to bet at a higher frequency because their equity in the pot cannot be denied. For this
reason it is important to make sure all the players in the GTO simulation have proper bet-sizes
and can react effectively to most lines so that the solver‚Äôs output is not skewed as a result of a
bad betting structure affecting one of the players in a given line ‚Äì unless you are actively trying
to exploit a player‚Äôs known leak.
 It can be tempting to use as many bet-sizes as you can in GTO calculations but, unfortunately,
using too many bet-sizes is impractical as each bet-size added increases the game tree size
exponentially. This makes it almost impossible for a human to correctly implement all of them in
game. Furthermore, bigger game trees increase the computational power and time required for
the GTO solver to finish the simulations which also makes the use of too many bet-sizes
impractical.
 We are faced with the dilemma of making the game trees as accurate as possible to represent a
wide range of possibilities while at the same time trying to make the size of the GTO simulations
manageable and the strategies simple enough to be implemented in game. Fortunately, we don‚Äôt
really need to test for all possible bet-sizes, as trying something like the square root of Pi would
be absurd. Most poker players bet a fraction of the pot, so bet-sizes such as 1/2-pot and 2/3-pot
are reasonable approximations. Testing for common bet-sizes and finding the ones the solver
typically likes the most could help us develop strategies that can be easily implemented while
remaining relevant to our own games.
 Sometimes the solver will show a clear preference for taking an action with a hand because the
EV for that action is clearly higher than the EV of taking any other action. Many times the EV
reported by the solver for individual combos will be virtually identical for different actions, such
as betting or checking and this can make players think that it doesn‚Äôt matter how to play post-
flop because everything is indifferent. This is a huge mistake. The EVs reported by the solver
assume both players are playing at equilibrium. If we start changing the frequencies of the hands
to a point where the overall strategy and range composition is no longer the same, the ranges
become exploitable and the EV is no longer guaranteed, as the Villain would be able to adjust
their strategy.
 Imagine a hypothetical situation where the GTO strategy is betting all hands in the range with
a 50% frequency. In this situation, you would be indifferent to betting or checking each combo.
If you take the top strongest half of the range and bet it at a 100% frequency and check the
weaker half 100%, your overall bet/check frequency would be the same but clearly the new
strategy will be a lot more exploitable than GTO. An aware opponent could start to fold more
often when you bet and attack your checks by playing very aggressively. Of course, it is
impossible to play all combos in the exact GTO frequencies, but it is important to try to keep the
ranges reasonably balanced and maintain board coverage. If the changes are too drastic, they
won‚Äôt go unnoticed, so before making any big changes to the GTO strategies, thinking it doesn‚Äôt
matter, first lock the new strategy in the solver and re-run it. See if there is any substantial EV
loss when playing against a min-exploitative opponent before implementing them in your games.
 It is vitally important to remember that the indifference between two or more actions is created
by your opponent‚Äôs play. If they are not aware that their strategies are fundamentally flawed and
unbalanced, then a seemingly close spot becomes more binary and against that particular Villain,
one given action will always yield a higher expectation than any other.

### TOPIC: THE THEORY OF FLOP PLAY
So, you‚Äôve put in the effort into understanding pre-flop play and have a good idea of what
player‚Äôs ranges look like in general. The three board cards are dealt and you ask yourself, what
now? Well, in this section we will study the different flop types, how the different flops interact
with the players‚Äô ranges, and what the effects of these interactions in post-flop betting strategies
are.

### TOPIC: Suit Isomorphism
Isomorphism is a general concept that appears in several areas of mathematics. The word derives
from the Greek iso, meaning ‚Äúequal‚Äù, and morphosis, meaning ‚Äúto form‚Äù or ‚Äúto shape‚Äù. Two or
more objects are isomorphic if they cannot be distinguished from one another by using only a
specified set of properties.
 As we saw in Chapter 1, by representing hands such as A‚ô†K‚ô†, A‚ô•K‚ô•, A‚ô£K‚ô£, AK in the
same square of a 13√ó13 grid as AKs, and repeating the same process to all other suited hands,
pocket pairs and offsuit hands, we can effectively reduce the 1,326 combos into 169 Poker
hands. This is possible because suits only become relevant post-flop when they interact with the
community cards, and pre-flop no suit is better or worse than any other suit (they are
strategically equivalent ‚Äì in other words, isomorphic).
 Based on the previous premise, there is no reason for a player to have any particular suit in
their range more frequently than any other. So, suit isomorphism can also be applied to the
22,100 specific flops, effectively reducing the game to 1,755 strategically unique flops.
 The four flops A‚ô†K‚ô†Q‚ô†, A‚ô•K‚ô•Q‚ô•, A‚ô£K‚ô£Q‚ô£, and AKQ can be studied as if they were
the exact same flop because on each of them, any given range will always have the exact same
number of flopped flushes, flush draws, sets, top pair, etc, and a hand like a flush will always be
played the same regardless of the suit. For example J‚ô†T‚ô† on A‚ô†K‚ô†Q‚ô† will be played exactly as
J‚ô•T‚ô• on A‚ô•K‚ô•Q‚ô•.
 There are two main reasons why we would want to reduce the size of the game. The first is
that, as humans, it is easier to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù strategies for only 1,755 flops rather than 22,100. The
second is for saving server time in solver calculations. Instead of calculating redundant flops
over and over again, we can run only one of each type of isomorphic flop and extrapolate from
the results.

### TOPIC: Dynamic and Static Boards
The concept of Flop Volatility was first introduced by Will Tipton in his excellent book Expert
Heads Up No Limit Hold‚Äôem, Volume1: Optimal and Exploitative Strategies (D&B Publishing).
 ‚ÄúSo, the second important texture-related property of a flop is how likely future cards are
 to change the relative values of players‚Äô hands. This likelihood is a property of the flop in
 combination with players‚Äô ranges. We will call boards on which hands are very likely to
 change in value by the river ‚Äòvolatile‚Äô. Boards on which good hands are likely to stay good
 and bad hands likely to stay bad are called ‚Äòstatic‚Äô.‚Äù
 In essence volatile (or dynamic) boards are those in which the player‚Äôs hand equities can shift
drastically in value on future streets, and static boards are those in which the hand equities tend
to remain relatively constant on most runouts. Low and connected boards with possible flush and
straight draws are very dynamic, and offsuit disconnected flops with high cards tend to be static.
 For example, in a typical BB vs EP single raised pot, the flop 8‚ô•7‚ô•3 would be a dynamic
board because there are many cards that can come and promote or demote the hand values in
both players‚Äô ranges. Any heart will complete a flush, and any 5, 6, 9, T or J can complete a
straight. Also, any turn or river card higher than an 8 can make a random hand improve to a
higher pair than the flopped top pair, while on a flop like K‚ô†72‚ô•, the hand‚Äôs value will remain
relatively constant on most turns and rivers.

### TOPIC: Flop Classification Scheme
A lot of poker players never study the game. They learn by playing, and this is probably the best
thing to do when you are first getting into poker. However, soon you will realize that, given the
immense number of different situations that can occur, even if all you did was to play poker 24/7
for years, it is impossible to learn everything there is to learn by just playing. Many players
understand this and they take the next step by getting professional coaching, but even the best
coaches won‚Äôt be available 24/7 to answer all your questions. Even if that was the case, they
surely won‚Äôt always have the right answer to every single spot. For this reason, people have tried
to develop assisting software for years. It has already happened in games such as chess, where
players can access top engines from their computers and even smartphones to get an immediate
answer to what the correct play is in any given chess position.
 In modern poker we have access to GTO solvers and, just as in chess, we now can get almost
immediate answers as to how to play any spot at any given time. But again, we are faced with the
issue of there being way too many spots to actually study each one of them. There are as many as
1,755 unique flops for any given spot, so this methodology is highly inefficient and would take
an enormous amount of time. Thus the need for a better system.
 Classification is the process of grouping things based on their similarities to make them easier
to identify or study. Flops that share common characteristics tend to be played in a similar
fashion. In this section, I describe a full comprehensive flop classification scheme, effectively
dividing the problem into smaller, easier-to-solve pieces while at the same time keeping an eye
on the game as a whole.
Flop Structure
The flop structure is the first thing to look at when the board is dealt. There are three possible
flop structures, and post-flop play will accordingly vary completely.
 Trips: A trips flop is a flop that contains all cards of the same rank. For example:
 A‚ô•A‚ô£A‚ô†, 7‚ô•7‚ô†7 or 3‚ô£3‚ô† 3.
 Paired: A flop is paired if it contains two cards of the same rank. A paired flop can be
 paired rainbow, for example K‚ô•K‚ô£5‚ô† or paired two-tone, for example Q88‚ô£.
 Unpaired: A flop is unpaired if all the cards have different ranks, for example: Q‚ô•74‚ô£
 or A‚ô•K‚ô•Q‚ô†.
Flop Textures
Flop texture is also important and can take three forms.
 Monotone: A monotone flop is a flop that contains all cards of a single suit, for example
 A‚ô•K‚ô•T‚ô• or J‚ô†6‚ô†5‚ô†.
 Two-tone: A two-tone flop is a flop that contains two cards of a single suit and a third
 card of another suit. There are three subtypes of two-tone flops. If the top and medium
 card are suited, the flop is said to be two-tone high-mid, for example A‚ô•K‚ô•Q‚ô†. If the
 medium and low cards are suited, the flop is said to be two-tone mid-low, for example
 J‚ô•6‚ô†5‚ô†. If the high and low cards are suited, the flop is said to be two-tone high-low, for
 example A‚ô•9‚ô†2‚ô•.
 Rainbow: A rainbow flop is a flop that contains all three cards of different suits, for
 example Q‚ô•9‚ô†7, 64‚ô£2‚ô† or K‚ô£J7‚ô•.
Flop Rank
The flop rank will depend on its highest card. For example, Kxx represents all flops that contain
a king and two other cards that are a king or lower (Table 97).
 As we can see, the higher the rank of the flop, the more flops of that rank exist. A-high boards
are the most common, with 21.74% of all flops being Axx. Notice how 85% of all flops are rank
9 or higher while the remaining 15% flops are rank 8 or lower.
Flopped Straights
Flops can also be categorized by the number of possible flopped straights (Table 98). For
example, on the flop AQ7 there are zero possible flopped straights. On KT9 there is one possible
flopped straight (with QJ). On 875 there are two possible flopped straights (96 and 64). Finally,
on JT9 there are three possible flopped straights (KQ, Q8 and 87).
 Flops that have zero flopped straights can also be subcategorized according to the number of
possible OESDs, but for the scope of this book we will only focus on the number of straights.
Flop Families
Some flops can be grouped together into families and subfamilies according to their rank. For
example, the flops A54, A53, A52, A43, A42 and A32 are so similar that in many situations,
they can be treated as the exact same flop: Ace with two low cards.
 First let‚Äôs group all the cards according to their rank:
High Card (H): Any card K, Q, J, T
Mid Card (M): Any card 9, 8, 7, 6
Low Card (L): Any card 5, 4, 3, 2
Ace (A): The lonely A
 Now the flops can be categorized using the card ranks as follows (Table 99).
Flop Subsets
As often mentioned previously, there are 22,100 possible flops in hold‚Äôem and, using suit
isomorphism, we can reduce that number to 1,755 strategically different flops. For practical
purposes, this number is still very large. For this reason, poker players, as well as programmers
and theorists, have attempted to simplify the game by creating smaller flop subsets that
accurately represent the whole game.
 The first publicly known attempt to develop a subset of flops was performed by the poker
theorist Will Tipton. His methodology consisted of first creating conditions a good subset must
satisfy and then finding the minimum subset of flops that satisfies all of them.
 Tipton‚Äôs proposed subset conditions:
 Any particular single card comes
 A flush draw of a particular suit comes
 A monotone flop of a particular suit comes
 A paired board with the pair being of a particular rank comes
 A three-straight board of any rank comes
 A board with any particular one-gap in the rank comes
 A board with any particular two-gap in the rank comes
 Tipton‚Äôs flop subset contains 103 flops but, unfortunately, it has some issues and cannot be
used to fully represent the entire game. His methodology makes sense and was improved upon
by others, but I found that it is simply too difficult to significantly reduce the game size while
keeping an eye on all of its characteristics. I also tried a different approach, by selecting a flop
representative of the different structures, textures, ranks, families and number of possible
straights, and the lowest number of flop subsets I could create was 356 flops.
 PioSOLVER developers Kuba and Piotr created a different methodology, consisting of
defining some metrics which a good subset must satisfy, and then ran custom software to find the
best subset of N elements that scores the best on the metrics. The metrics they used are equity
against full range, against 50% range and against AA, as well as EVs from all 1,755 flops.
 Kuba and Piotr tried several metrics and determined that a mix of EV and EQ performs better
than others including EV alone. They developed subsets of different sizes, including 25, 49, 74,
95 and 184 flops. The more flops in the flop subset, the more accurate results you will get. This
is particularly the case with high SPR, because of the different ways some elements of the range
can hit some boards very strongly and create cooler situations that will end up with the players
playing massive pots. For these situations to be accurately represented, you need to have as many
flops as possible. You can find the subsets and more details on their blog at www.piosolver.com.
 Their pre-flop subsets are optimized to accurately approximate equities and EV for the pre-
flop solver, not post-flop strategies. For this reason, these subsets are not guaranteed to produce a
good approximation of post-flop play. This is why I decided to go for a different approach and
simply use super-computers to solve the full game, all 1,755 flops in many different spots, and
create custom software to analyze the data. This chapter was written using the results from this
investigation. You can find more details of this work on www.gtopoker.io.

### TOPIC: The Flop Donk Bet (DK)
A Villain who is IP (BN, CO, MP, EP), raises and the action folds around to Hero who is in the
BB and makes a call. At this point you should have a pretty good idea about Villain‚Äôs pre-flop
range because of their position, stack depth and any tendencies you might have noticed. You also
know what your own BB defending range looks like, what hands you would most likely be 3-
betting pre-flop and what hands you are calling against this Villain in this particular situation.
The flop is dealt and it is your time to act. Should you bet or check?
 This is by far the most common situation in poker. Most poker hands will be played
 heads-up in a single raised pot between the BB and IP. Thus playing well post-flop after
 defending the blinds is of vital importance for any poker player‚Äôs success.
 So, this will be the first post-flop situation we will study.
 In this BB vs IP setup, the IP Player is commonly said to have the ‚Äúbetting lead‚Äù because they
were the pre-flop aggressor. For this reason, IP is expected to continue the aggression on the flop
by betting frequently when checked to. This type of bet performed by the previous street
aggressor is known as a continuation bet (c-bet). Since IP is expected to c-bet the flop at a very
high frequency, the BB is also expected to check to the pre-flop aggressor and never take the
betting lead. When the player in the BB doesn‚Äôt check and instead takes the lead by making a
bet, the poker regulars would call this a donk bet, because it‚Äôs a bet that goes against the norm.
But does this general consensus of not taking the betting lead away from the pre-flop aggressor
make sense conceptually from a game theory perspective?
 First of all, in game theory there is no such a thing as the ‚Äúbetting lead‚Äù, so taking the betting
lead away from a player does not make sense in GTO. As we saw in the theory of betting,
making a bet is a function of leveraging informational advantage, range composition and SPR
with the objective of realizing your equity or preventing the opponent‚Äôs equity realization. If we
want to confirm or refute the general ideas about donk bets, we must do so through GTO
principles.
 I aggregated the data of GTO solutions across all possible flops in BB vs BN and BB vs UTG
situations in single raised pots with stack depths 20bb, 30bb and 40bb. The BN and UTG were
used because they represent the widest and tightest ranges, while strategies from other positions
will fall somewhere in between. The results show that the overall BB donk bet frequency is only
2% (for 1/4 and 2/3 bet-sizes) and the average IP c-betting frequency is 84%. The GTO
simulations agree with the general consensus about donk betting not being widely used and c-
bets being very common. However, if we look deeper into the data, there are some spots where
the solver actually likes donk betting at a high frequency (Table 100).
 On average, the highest frequency donk betting flop is 654r (67%), and one of the lowest donk
betting flops is A76r (0.3%), Why is the BB betting frequency on A76r so low compared to
654r?
 If betting was clearly the highest EV option for any hand in the BB range, the solver would
always do it. If betting is indifferent to checking, then the hand will be played as a mixed
strategy. If a hand is never being bet, it is because betting is lower EV compared to checking.
 Returning to our EV equation:
 The EV of betting a hand depends on how often Villain folds, how often they raise, how often
they call and the amount of equity Hero has when called. The stronger Villain‚Äôs range, the less
they will fold, the more often they will raise and the less equity Hero will have when called.
 The GTO solver assumes play against a GTO opponent who knows your strategy and will call,
raise and fold optimally against you. If IP‚Äôs range is so strong that they won‚Äôt be folding much vs
a bet and, in contrast, will be able to raise a lot and call effectively, then betting becomes a lot
less enticing than it would be against a weaker range distribution.
 Clearly IP has the equity advantage with 62% equity vs the BB‚Äôs 38% on A76r, which will of
course reduce the profitability of the BB‚Äôs bets, while on 654r, the BB has the equity advantage
with 51% equity vs IP‚Äôs 49%, making the BB‚Äôs bets more profitable on this flop texture.
 Range vs range equity is an important factor as it is difficult to develop betting strategies when
having a substantial equity disadvantage. However, as we discussed in the theory of betting
section, the range composition is even more important than raw equity.
 Applying the concept of equity buckets that was introduced earlier, we can go beyond raw
equity and get a better idea about the range distribution for both players across the different flops
(Diagram 25).
 For the definition of strong, good, weak and trash hands, see the Equity Buckets section
 of Chapter 10.
 On 654r, the BB has 7% strong hands, and IP has only 4%, while on A76r, the BB has 8%
strong hands and IP has a staggering 31% strong hands! What happens is that, on A76r, IP‚Äôs top
pairs (any Ax) have on average 85% equity vs the BB‚Äôs range, while a top pair on 654 will
average about 65% equity. Additionally, on 654r, all of IP‚Äôs Ax will have an average of 49%
equity, effectively turning them into weak hands. On 654r, the BB‚Äôs good hands increase from
17% to 40% and the trash hands reduce from 49% to 18% when compared to A76r.
 Because of this distribution, the IP Player will be incentivized to lower the c-betting frequency
on 654r, given that the bulk of their range are weak hands that don‚Äôt perform well against a flop
check/raise. So, by checking back more often, IP gets to see a free turn and realize equity. The
BB reacts to this by donk betting many hands, forcing IP to either fold or put more money into
the pot with the hands that would have been happy to check behind and see a free turn.
 Donk betting makes sense on 654r because it denies IP EQR, and also helps BB realize equity
by leveraging the informational advantage of leading out with a well-balanced range that cannot
be easily attacked by IP. This takes advantage of IP‚Äôs lack of strong hands that would be happy
to raise for value. This also limits the number of hands that can be raised as a bluff, resulting in
IP having an overall low raising frequency of 20% on 654r, whereas IP has a raising frequency
on A76r of 53% (GTO frequencies vs a donk bet-size of 1/4-pot).
 Donk betting on A76r doesn‚Äôt make sense because it does not help the BB deny IP EQR. In
this case, the opposite actually occurs, because IP‚Äôs range is so strong on this board that a donk
bet can get raised with such a high frequency that the effect would be reversed. It would be the
BB who is forced to continue putting more money into the pot with hands that would rather see a
cheap turn card or fold, reducing their equity and resulting in a lower EQR and EV loss for OOP
(Table 101).
 A76r is so good for IP that they get to c-bet 100% of their range and not worry about being x/r
too often. For this reason, the BB doesn‚Äôt need to lead out with their strongest hands to get value
as IP will keep putting money into the pot with their entire range when checked to. If the BB
starts leading strong hands on A76r, it would only help IP as they could then choose to fold weak
hands that would have continued putting money into the pot in the form of a c-bet and only
continue when it is profitable to do so.
 If we force the BB to donk every time they have top pair or better (10%), their total EV
reduces from 25 to 13, as this strategy is highly exploitable. In the GTO solution, the checking
range is well protected because the BB is never leading out but, in the locked strategy, the BB is
donking their strongest hands, leaving their checking range vulnerable. This makes their EV after
checking decline to 5.6. In this case, the BB‚Äôs EV when betting is extremely high because the
betting range is strong but betting only happens 10% of the time, while checking happens 90%.
 If the BB starts to include many bluffs in the leading range, then IP would start calling wider
and frequently raising the donk bets. If the BB tries a strategy of leading only with weak hands,
the result is even worse as now IP will be able to raise 100% of the time, making the BB not only
lose the entire pot when betting, but also their 1/4-pot size bet. For this reason, it works better for
OOP to not split their range and simply check 100% on A76r.
 If we subdivide all flops by donk betting frequency, we can get a better idea of how the ranges
interact with the flops (Table 102).
 Unsurprisingly, the highest equity and EV flops for the BB are also the highest frequency
donk bet boards. However, it is important to understand that the high donk betting frequencies
are an effect and not a cause. As we will see in this section, the main cause of the BB having
higher equity and EV on some flops is the way the ranges are distributed which in turn results in
higher donk betting frequencies.
High Donk Bet Frequency Flops (50%+)
There are about 34 distinct flops that result in an average donk bet over 50% of the time against
both the BN and UTG. They are in ranks 7-x-x and 6-x-x with one to three possible flopped
straights. The higher the number of flopped straights, the smaller the donk bet-size and the
higher the donk bet frequency used. Rainbow flops are donked at a higher frequency than two-
tone flops and, in general, monotone flops get donked a lot less frequently.
 On the high donk frequency flops, the BB has an average of 50% equity and is able to over-
realize that equity (103% EQR), capturing an average of 52% of the pot (Table 103). The main
reason why the BB over-realizes equity is the way the equity is distributed (Diagram 26).
 Here, the BB‚Äôs range is more polarized than IP‚Äôs range. The BB has the advantage in both
strong and good hands, while 50% of IP‚Äôs range are weak hands that will have a more difficult
time realizing equity and will therefore benefit from playing passively. This range construction
resembles the Clairvoyance Toy game, with the IP having the more depolarized range, which
makes the BB want to take the betting lead.
 With stack depths between 30-40bb, the BB wants to bet strong hands 73% of the time, good
hands 64%, weak hands 59%, and trash hands are bet 49%. The most used donk bet-size is 1/4-
pot, with 2/3-pot size bets used on average 5% (Diagram 27). If we allow bigger bet-sizes in the
simulations, the BB will even choose to overbet the pot with a small frequency, but the overall
range composition on this type of high donk bet board seems to favor the small donk bet
(Diagram 28).
 With a 20bb effective stack, the 2/3-pot size donk bet is preferred. It seems that at 20bb, the
BB‚Äôs SPR is small enough that the BB is happy to stack off with a lot of good equity hands on
the flop, so the bigger bet-size protects the BB‚Äôs equity by getting more folds and helps the BB
realize equity by getting all the money in on the flop when their equity is high. The BB‚Äôs
strongest hands seem to prefer the smaller bet-size because they aren‚Äôt as vulnerable, so they
don‚Äôt mind getting called more frequently.
 When stacks are deeper, there aren‚Äôt many hands that are happy to get all-in on the flop so,
instead, a smaller donk bet-size allows the BB to call a re-raise and see the turn without having
to get all the money in on the flop.
 Strong and good hands are also an important part of the checking ranges. The more checking
happens, the more important it becomes to have strong and good hands in the checking range so
the range remains balanced and protected.
 Donk betting also happens on average more often vs UTG (67% of the time) than vs the BN
(53% of the time). This is because the high donk betting boards are missed a lot more often by
UTG ranges.
Donk Betting Range Example
BB vs UTG on 654r (30bb effective stacks)
Strong hands are bet 77% of the time
 Straights are the strongest hands the BB can have on this flop. The lowest straight 32 is
 the most vulnerable and it unblocks IP‚Äôs continuing range, so it gets bet 91%, while the
 other straights 87 get bet 80% and 73 only gets bet 50%.
 Sets. Top set gets bet at a very high frequency (94%). The smaller sets are bet very
 infrequently (16-31%), because they don‚Äôt block top pair.
 Two Pairs are bet at a very high frequency. 54 is bet with the highest frequency (96%),
 followed by 64 (94%) and 65 bets the lowest frequency (73%) because it blocks more of
 IP‚Äôs continuing range and is also the least vulnerable.
Good hands are bet 70% of the time
 Overpairs. The strongest overpairs TT and 99 are bet 100% of the time, mid pairs 88 and
 77 are bet 38% of the time.
 Top Pairs are bet 78% of the time. The ones with the highest kickers and the ones that
 have an OESD betting the highest frequency. The middle kickers are checked more
 frequently.
 Second Pairs are bet 71% of the time. The ones with the highest kickers and the ones that
 have an OESD betting the highest frequency. The middle kickers are checked more
 frequently.
 Third Pairs are bet 65% of the time. The ones with the highest kickers and the ones that
 have an OESD betting the highest frequency. The middle kickers are checked more
 frequently.
 Under Pairs 22-33 are bet 78%. 22 is bet more often than 33
Weak hands are bet 61% of the time
 OESD are bet 67% of the time. 7x hands are bet more often than 3x.
 Ace High is bet 67% of the time in a reverse linear fashion. The weakest A-high being bet
 more often than the strongest ones. For example, A9s is bet 99% of the time and AQs is
 only bet 40%.
 King High is bet 54% of the time in a reverse linear fashion.
 Gutshots are bet 70% of the time. The ones that have two overcards being bet more often
 than ones with a single overcard.
Trash hands are bet 62% of the time
 Air, no pair, no draw, two completely disconnected overcards and gutshots with a 2 and
 no pair and combos with back door flush draw are bet more often than combos with no
 BDFD.
Mid Donk Bet Frequency Flops (25%-50%)
There are about 100 Flops that get donk bet 25-50% of the time. The main examples of flops that
can generally be donk bet 25-50% of the time are: unpaired subfamilies 8MM, 8ML, 8LL, 7ML,
7LL, 6LL, and 5LL with one to three possible flopped straights. The only monotone flop is 764,
and the paired flops are 766, 755, 655 (Diagram 29).
 Donk betting happens with the same frequency against UTG and the BN, roughly 35% of the
time and checking happens 65% of the time, as the equity distribution doesn‚Äôt change too much
in either case.
 On the mid donk bet flops, equities run very close. IP has a slight equity advantage, 52%
compared to the BB‚Äôs 48%. However, the BB‚Äôs range is more polarized with the bulk of the
range being strong, good and trash hands, while IP still has a lot of weak hands that benefit from
playing passively and seeing free cards in order to realize equity (Diagram 30).
 With 30-40bb, strong hands prefer using the bigger bet-size on paired boards and a smaller
size on unpaired boards. Hands are bet linearly according to their equity with the highest equity
hands being bet more often than low equity hands. The structure of the betting ranges is similar
to what we saw previously in the High Donk Bet frequency flops, betting the same type of hands,
but doing so with a lower frequency, checking everything more often so the checking range is
more protected (Diagram 31).
 With 20bbs, the donking strategy is extremely polarized, betting mostly strong, good and trash
hands. For this reason, a bigger bet-size is preferred, with the smaller size being used in the
opposite way, mostly with weak hands, but also with some frequency of strong, good and trash
hands in order to make the strategy well balanced (Diagram 32).
Low Donk Bet Frequency Flops (10%-25%)
Approximately 181 distinct flops get donk bet with 10% to 25% frequency. In this situation the
67%-pot size bet is preferred (9%) over the 25%-pot size bet (7%). The BB donks slightly more
frequently against the BN (16%) than against UTG (14%).
 The unpaired donked flops subfamilies are: ALL, 9MM, 8MM, 8ML, 8LL, 7ML, 7LL, 6LL,
5LL, and 4LL.
 The paired families are: 99A, 88A, 77H, 77M, 77L, 66A, 66H, 66M, 66L, 55A, 55H, 55M,
55L, 44H, 44M, 44L, 33M (Diagram 33).
 In low donk bet frequency flops, IP‚Äôs range dominance is clear (Diagram 34). OOP‚Äôs equity
drops to 45% and under-realizes by 6%, capturing only 43% of the pot. The number of OOP
trash hands finally outweighs the number of weak hands. OOP‚Äôs strong and good hand
percentage is significantly lower than IP. For this reason, checking starts to become the dominant
strategy.
 On low frequency donk bet flops, the donk betting ranges are a little more polarized and, for
this reason, a larger bet-size is preferred. Donk betting does not seem to be too affected by stack
depth and so the frequencies are similar with 20bb, 30bb and 40bb effective stacks (Diagrams
35-36).
No Donk Bet Flops (0%-10%)
The vast majority of flops belong to this category. Pretty much all flops that were not included in
any of the other groups. In general, this means trips, monotone, high card paired, disconnected
two-tone, HXX and AXX flops are bad donk betting flops.
 In general, this group of flops are bad for the BB, providing an average of 39% equity and low
EQR of 76%, for an average EV of 30% of the pot. On these boards, IP‚Äôs range is so strong that
OOP is forced to check with a high frequency, for an average donk bet frequency of about 1%.
OOP‚Äôs range is so weak that it doesn‚Äôt have enough strong hands compared to IP to be able to
split this range so, for the most part, removing the option to donk bet on these kinds of flops does
not reduce BB‚Äôs EV too significantly. Playing a 100% checking frequency is recommended.
 Flop families that have similar structures and textures tend to be played in a similar
 fashion. So if you want to dig deeper into donk betting range composition, I recommend
 running sample flops from each donk bet frequency group in a GTO solver to familiarize
 yourself with the different spots, how to react to flop raises and how to follow through on
 future streets.

### TOPIC: The Value of Donk Betting
The general consensus states that donk betting is bad and should not be done. However, as we
have just seen, donk betting is widely used by the solver on some flop textures. Given that donk
bets are rarely used, how big of a mistake is it to opt for a simpler strategy that always checks to
the pre-flop aggressor when OOP in a SRP?
 In Table 104 we can see the key flop metrics of BB vs BN with a 30bb effective stack on the
654r flop. The GTO strategy is compared to a simulation where the BB‚Äôs donk betting option is
removed to make the BB check 100% of their range.
 654r is one of the highest donk bet flops. When the BB loses the ability to lead out on this
board, they lose 1.1% of the pot or 6.5bb/100 and the EQR decreases by 2.25%. In a 5.6bb pot,
playing a 100% donk bet strategy cost the BB 6.27bb/100 when playing against a minimally
exploitative opponent.
 The value of donk betting will change depending on the SPR and what the value of the option
for the OOP player to bet is. For example, on the A76r flop, OOP should donk bet about 0.4% of
the time and, if we remove the BB‚Äôs option to donk bet, their overall EV remains the same.
 Donk betting only happens at a high frequency on a small number of flops that are also low
frequency flops, so the impact of the EV loss of choosing a simpler strategy that always checks
when OOP will not be significant in the grand scheme of things. Additionally, implementing
donk betting strategies correctly can be difficult in-game. That said, if you play in really tough
games where every possible edge counts, taking the time to study and incorporate donk bets can
become a valuable tool, particularly if your opponents are not used to dealing with flop donk
bets, which can result in them making more mistakes that you could potentially capitalize on.
 You can of course also choose to donk bet exploitatively against weaker players. For example,
if you know that the Villain will c-bet at a high frequency but would never raise a donk bet
without a strong hand, you can put in a small bet with some hands that will work as a blocking
bet, allowing you to see the next card cheaply with some weak hands while giving you
information on your opponent‚Äôs holding.
 Another example is if you know the Villain is overly aggressive and will almost always raise a
flop donk bet. Then, you can lead out with very strong hands to induce a raise from the Villain.
This would of course leave you exposed to counter exploitation, so it requires excellent
knowledge about your opponent‚Äôs tendencies.

### TOPIC: The Power of Position
In this section, we will use the high and low donk bet frequency flops 654r and A76r in BB vs
BN situations with 30bb effective stacks. We will compare the GTO simulations against
modified hypothetical simulations that will help us better understand the effect of being IP and
OOP post-flop.
GTO: Modified GTO Solution with new flop bet-sizings for both players: 1.25-pot, 2/3-pot, 1/4-
pot.
Positions Flipped: Modified solution where the players‚Äô ranges are flipped, so now OOP has the
BN range and the IP Player has the BB range.
 Hero is on the BN and opens a standard GTO 49% opening range and the action folds to the
Villain in the BB who calls with a standard 64% GTO range. Now imagine the positions are
flipped on the flop, but both players keep their original ranges. Now Hero is OOP with a 49%
BN range, and the Villain is IP with a 64% BB calling range (Table 105).
 Let‚Äôs start by analyzing what happens to Hero after flipping the positions.
 On A76r, Hero‚Äôs range is so strong compared to the Villain‚Äôs that Hero still over-realizes
equity, but not as much as with position. Hero‚Äôs EV reduces from capturing 75% to only being
able to capture 68.3% of the pot, costing Hero 6.7% of the pot. Hero‚Äôs strategy also changes. It is
still optimum to bet 100%, but now the 125% and 1/4-pot bet-sizes are used more than the 2/3-
pot sizing.
 When playing IP, Hero‚Äôs strategy is almost always aimed to bet across three streets. For this
reason, the 67% size is used more often as it allows an effective triple barrel. When we flip the
positions, some elements of Hero‚Äôs range only want to play a two street game. Therefore, after
overbetting the flop and getting called, Hero will mostly go all-in or check on the turn. After
checking and facing a bet, Hero will mostly x/r all-in or fold. This way, Hero reduces the
positional disadvantage.
 On 654r, Hero has a range disadvantage so, unlike on A76r, betting the entire range isn‚Äôt
advisable because the risk of the check-raise (which would destroy Hero‚Äôs equity) increases
drastically. So, with position, Hero can only bet about 48% of the time after the BB checks.
When Hero is OOP with the BN‚Äôs range on this flop, the total betting frequency drops down to
9.23% and the most used bet-size is the 125% overbet. Again, Hero aims to play a two street
game and go all-in on the turn with a reasonably high frequency.
 Weak hands make up 51% of Hero‚Äôs range. When in position these would be checked back
most of the time to realize equity and would prefer to play a small pot, so as not to risk being x/r
and blown off their equity. Unfortunately, when checking OOP, Hero is not guaranteed to see a
turn card and will instead often face a bet and be forced to give up equity with many hands that
would benefit from seeing a free turn card. For this reason, when OOP, Hero has to check many
strong hands that can x/r the flop, forcing the Villain to bet less often, and thus allowing Hero‚Äôs
weak hands to realize equity. If Hero does not protect the checking range, Villain will bet at a
higher frequency, costing Hero a lot of EV. For this reason, Hero‚Äôs checking frequency is even
higher when OOP with a range disadvantage. When OOP on 654r, Hero‚Äôs EQR decreases from
100% to 79%, costing 9.7% of the pot!
 Next, we will analyze the same situation from the Villain‚Äôs point of view, with the BB now
being in position, and compare it to the GTO simulations. In the flipped simulations we will
assume OOP checks 100% of the time to IP, so the ranges are the exact same as when the BB
was OOP (Table 106).
 On A76r the Villain‚Äôs range is so weak compared to Hero‚Äôs range that, even when having
position, it is best to check back 100% of the time as betting would result in being x/r at a very
high frequency. The main difference is that, after checking back the flop, the Villain gets to
realize a lot more equity than when OOP and gets forced to fold a lot of weak and trash hands
that will improve to made hands or draws on the turn. This results in a huge EV increase from
25% when OOP to 37.8% when IP for a total gain of 12.8%!
 On 654r pretty much all hands that wanted to bet when OOP still want to bet when the Villain
is IP. The main difference is that now the larger bet-sizes aren‚Äôt as necessary and the Villain opts
to use the 25% bet-size almost exclusively. In this case the BB increases their EV by capturing
an extra 10% of the pot.
Symmetric Ranges: Modified solution where both players have the exact same range. We will
examine one example with both players having the BB range and another with both players
having the BN range (Tables 107-108).
 Despite having identical ranges, the IP player captures on average 5% more of the pot than
50% equity, for a total EQR of 110%. Meanwhile OOP only realizes 90% of their equity,
capturing on average only 45% of the pot.
 Different experiments that use different sample flops, or even a large subset of flops, give
 results that are consistent with the value of position being between 5-10% of the pot.
 The more streets left to play, the bigger IP‚Äôs information advantage becomes as IP gets to act
last on each street. As mentioned previously, every action taken at the table conveys information,
so every time OOP takes an action, this reveals some information about their range to IP, who
can use this information to his advantage before having to make a decision. This continues to the
river, where IP will have the most complete information possible regarding OOP‚Äôs range.
Furthermore, when studying complex strategies in Chapter 4, we established that there is a direct
correlation between stack depth or SPR and Hero‚Äôs ability to realize equity. Deeper stacks
benefit the IP Player and hurt the OOP player. For this reason, OOP tends to use larger bet-
sizings than IP, either to get more folds and end the hand immediately or, if called, to decrease
the positional disadvantage by reducing the SPR.
 Another measure OOP takes to decrease positional disadvantage is to avoid splitting their
range on flops where they have a large range disadvantage and thus not give away any
information to IP by checking 100% of the time, as seen in the donk betting section of this
chapter.
 Being IP with a weak range is not as bad as being OOP with a weak range. In general, strong
ranges will realize most of their equity and sometimes even over-realize it when OOP, while
weak ranges heavily under-realize their equity when OOP. For this reason, over-folding the big
blind to steals was a predominant strategy in both live and online poker for many years as
players generally tried to avoid this unfavorable situation. This in turn created an opportunity for
observant players to capitalize on this by loosening up their opening ranges and attacking the
tight players‚Äô big blinds. Subsequently, players started to readjust their BB strategy and began
calling very wide vs open raises, which resulted in the BB defending way too many marginal
hands that made post-flop play too difficult for the BB, hurting their overall EQR.
 Now, with modern solvers, both pre- and post-flop play have in general improved drastically,
resulting in players defending in a close to optimal fashion from the BB. This is particularly true
in high stakes online cash games where most regulars play a sound baseline pre-flop GTO
strategy and are now forced to look for possible edges elsewhere. However, even at the highest
level, players still make mistakes. The game is not completely solved and there is always room
for improvement and exploitation.
 The goal with this chapter is to improve the players‚Äô underlying understanding of the
 game so that they are capable of finding these edges by themselves and to turn them into
 winning strategies applicable to their own games.

### TOPIC: THE FLOP CONTINUATION-BET (C-BET)
Flop c-betting is one of the most important topics in poker. It is a complex subject that has been
studied and discussed by poker players and theorists for decades. Contrary to most typical theory
books, I decided to begin the flop discussion with the BB instead of leaping directly into c-
betting. This is because I want readers to first develop a good conceptual understanding of
betting in general, how the post-flop action is a function of the players‚Äô relative positions, range
distributions and SPR. After studying OOP betting and the power of position, all that is left in
order to understand the flop c-bet is to analyze the situation from the IP player‚Äôs point of view.
 Just as we did when studying the donk bet, for this section we will use the aggregated data
from thousands of GTO solutions with stack depths 20bb, 30bb and 40bb with standard GTO
MTT starting ranges. The ranges in your own games might be different to the ones used for these
simulations, but I have found that, as long as the ranges used are ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù, the overall results
for post-flop play won‚Äôt be significantly affected. If the standard ranges in your own games differ
too much from the equilibrium strategies, you can still benefit by understanding equilibrium and
then applying the principles discussed in this chapter to understand how your standard ranges are
different from GTO and how you can deviate from equilibrium to further attack the imbalances
introduced in the new strategies. Getting your own solver and running some custom simulations
can help you better understand this effect and find good exploitative lines against population
tendencies.
 In the previous section we found that, from a GTO point of view, there isn‚Äôt too much
incentive for OOP to bet out on the flop, but what about IP? What is their equilibrium strategy?
Are they incentivized to bet or check? Can they play a pure strategy that always checks back the
flop without a significant EV loss in the way the BB can?
 If IP plays a strategy that always checks back the flop, they will have an EV loss of 26bb/100,
so c-betting the flop is of massive importance to IP. In this section, we will study the principles
behind the flop c-bet and use that knowledge to effectively develop sound c-betting strategies.

### TOPIC: Overall Flop Metrics
This analysis starts on IP‚Äôs decision point after the BB checks. For these calculations, we used
simulations where the BB had the option to donk bet. However, donk betting happens very
infrequently and, in general, checking GTO ranges will remain well balanced even when donk
betting is widely used. Therefore, we can expect IP‚Äôs overall strategy to not be affected and be
applicable to players who have a GTO donking range and players who check 100% of the time.
 Players who have a non-GTO donking range are in general quite exploitable as their donking
range tends to be always strong or always weak, so all you need to do against them is figure out
their strategy. If they always donk strong, you can start to overfold the bottom of your range
when they bet and bet at a high frequency when they check. If they donk weak, you can bluff
raise them on the flop, trap them with your really strong hands that don‚Äôt need much protection,
and check back the flop a little more than usual to avoid being x/r by a checking range that is
heavily skewed towards strong hands.
 Both the BN and UTG over-realize their equity by 15%, but since UTG‚Äôs range has higher
equity, they are able to capture a bigger portion of the pot than the BN (Table 110).
 Clearly IP has the overall range advantage. As expected, UTG‚Äôs ~15% range is much stronger
than the BN‚Äôs ~44% range (Diagram 38). This aligns well with UTG‚Äôs higher c-bet frequency.
Strong hands
Strong hands are incentivized to bet and increase the size of the pot but, as we know, betting only
your high-equity hands and checking your low-equity hands would be a highly exploitable
strategy. For this reason, IP also has to bet some weaker hands on the flop so that the c-betting
range remains balanced.
 Sometimes checking back strong hands works well in situations when they don‚Äôt need as much
protection. When they block the Villain‚Äôs continuing range, or when they are so nutted that it
doesn‚Äôt matter if you give a free card so the Villain can catch a small piece or start bluffing,
checking behind with some of your strong hands makes sense. This is referred to as trapping. An
added benefit is that checking strong hands also helps protect your checking range.
Good hands
Good hands also benefit by betting and gaining value from worse hands as well as for protection
to get some folds from hands that have equity. However, sometimes it makes sense to check back
your good hands when the BB‚Äôs range is very polarized to hands that are either stronger than
yours or have very little equity. By checking behind, you give the Villain a chance to pick up
some equity with trash hands or start bluffing with them, while keeping the pot size under
control when you are beat. This action is often referred to as pot controlling.
Weak hands
Weak hands benefit from checking back when the Villain‚Äôs range is strong and you risk getting
x/r and pushed off your hand. However, they do well as semi-bluffs when your opponent‚Äôs range
is generally weak and cannot x/r you at a high frequency.
Trash hands
Trash hands will not improve too often when checked back, so they are in general c-bet more
often than weak hands. They mostly benefit from having fold equity. If called, they will still
have some equity in the pot, but their equity is sufficiently low that you don‚Äôt mind having to
bet/fold them vs a x/r. Betting your trash is often referred to as a pure bluff.
 UTG‚Äôs c-bet frequency and bet-sizes are bigger than the BN because the UTG range is
stronger than that of the BN. In general, the more strong hands your range has compared to your
opponent‚Äôs, the more frequently you can bet. This is because the more strong hands your betting
range has, the more you can bet other hands in your range because your range is protected. The
fact that UTG‚Äôs range is in general stronger than the BN‚Äôs also allows the use the bigger bet-
sizes more frequently (Diagram 41).
 The bigger sizes are generally used less often when stacks are shallower, and the use of bigger
bets (and even overbets) becomes more relevant when stacks are deeper. This makes sense
because, in general, when stacks are shallow, big bets aren‚Äôt needed to get all the money in
across two or three streets. There is no need to overcommit large portions of your stack when the
SPR is low. The only exception is the all-in bet, which gets used more often when stacks get
shallow, because the risk/reward ratio is much better when all your chips are going in and you
are guaranteed to realize your equity (Diagram 41).
 Since the BB has more offsuit connectors than IP, flops with more possible flopped straights
will, as expected, favor the BB. So, the c-bet frequency decreases as there are more straights
possible on the flop. Flops with zero flopped straights are the highest c-bet ones.
 Within the flops with zero possible straights, we can create a subcategory for the number of
possible open-ended straight draws (Diagram 42).
 Not surprisingly, the flops with three OESDs are the ones with the lowest c-bet frequency and
with the larger bet-sizes, as the BB will have more possible straight draws and IP‚Äôs strong hands
need more protection (Diagram 43).
 The only 2xx flop is 222 and it is c-bet 100% of the time. Axx flops are the second most c-bet
flops, with a 96% c-bet frequency. 3xx flops are only 333, 322 or 332 and are c-bet 93% of the
time. Kxx flops are c-bet 88%, Qxx and Txx are c-bet 85% and, as expected, middle and low
flops are c-bet at the lowest frequencies, with 6xx being the lowest at only 62% (Diagram 44).
should be frequently min-bet. This will be examined in greater detail in the forthcoming sections.
Flop C-betting by Structure
The flop structure is one of the key characteristics that drives post-flop play as the strategies
differ drastically if the flops feature trips, are paired, or are unpaired.
 Trips are by far the absolute best flops for IP, who can capture on average 81% of the pot on
this texture. Paired boards, on the other hand, give the BB a lot of strong hands, polarizing their
range and allowing them some counterplay. This range polarization is one of the main reasons
why betting very small is optimal on paired boards. Small bets force the BB to reveal a lot of
information about their holding, as there are a lot of trash and weak hands the BB has to fold,
regardless of IP‚Äôs bet-size, and IP loses the minimum when having to bet/fold the flop with the
bottom of their range.
 In general, small bets are preferred when IP‚Äôs range has this type of depolarized distribution
with the bulk of hands being good, but not great, and a low frequency of trash and weak hands.
In situations where IP‚Äôs range distribution is more polarized with a bigger proportion of strong,
weak and trash hands, bigger bet-sizes are used more often.
 On flops featuring trips, there is a clear pattern of bigger bet-sizes being used more often on
the lower ranks, while 1/3-pot is the most frequently seen bet-size.
 On paired flops, min-betting is clearly the preferred bet-size for most flop ranks, although 1/3-
pot is preferred on flop families AAM, AAL and LLL, 1/2-pot is seldom used, while 2/3-pot is
never used. The most checked families are MMH, HHA, LLM, LLH, LLL, MMM, MML and
LLA. As expected, flops with the paired card being of low or middle rank tend to benefit the BB
more than IP, and so they get checked more often than flops that contain a paired high card or an
ace.
 On unpaired flops, the least c-bet flop families are LLL, MMM, MML, MLL and HMM. We
still see a lot of bet-size mixing, so we have to look deeper into the unpaired flop textures to get a
better idea of how to approach them.
Flop C-betting by Texture (Unpaired Flops)
Unpaired flops make 82.82% of all flops. In this section, we will look into the different textures
of unpaired flops and how they affect the players‚Äô range distributions and flop strategies.
 Monotone flops are the most c-bet but they also have the lowest EV for IP. On this texture,
IP‚Äôs strong hand percentage diminishes by a large margin, while the BB‚Äôs strong hand
percentage increases because a lot of hands that would be trash on other textures are now flushes
and a lot of IP‚Äôs hands that would be strong on other textures reduce in equity. The BB‚Äôs weak
hands percentage also increases, as many hands that would be complete trash on other textures
now have some sort of flush draw. This range distribution creates a similar situation as on paired
boards, with the BB having a polarized distribution, while IP is more depolarized. For this
reason, using smaller bet-sizes is preferred as they will get a lot of folds from the BB‚Äôs hands
that have terrible equity while not overcommitting with all of IP‚Äôs good, but not great hands.
 I often see players making the mistake of betting large on monotone flops, thinking that they
need to protect their good hands and make the BB fold. The problem with that is that if your bet-
size is too large, you force the BB to fold the weak hands that would continue against a smaller
bet and will be isolating yourself against the top of their range that will either have you beat or
have a ton of equity.
 The lower the ranks and the more connected the board, the less IP gets to c-bet, with MMM,
LLL, MML, and HMM being the least c-bet flops. Flops with three possible flopped straights are
checked 31% of the time, flops with two straights are checked 28%, flops with one straight are
checked 17% and flops with zero straights are checked only 10% of the time. Stack depth also
has an effect, with deeper stacks being more likely to check the flop.
 We could easily simplify our strategy on monotone flops to use only 1/3-pot bet-sizes or min-
bets without suffering a significant EV loss.
 Again, we see the trend of lower ranks being c-bet less frequently. However, we see a big
difference in the way bet-sizes are used compared to monotone flops, with bigger bet-sizes being
used a lot more frequently. Again, this is a function of the way the equities are distributed on
two-tone flops, with IP having 24% strong hands compared to the BB‚Äôs 5%.
 On rainbow flops, IP‚Äôs range advantage is even greater than on two-tone flops, which will
again result in an even higher preference for larger bet-sizes. Hands that are strong on rainbow
flops usually also tend to be strong on the turn and river. Conversely, on two-tone flops, the
presence of possible flush draws will result in more abrupt equity shifts. The absence of flush
draws on the flop also increases the percentage of the BB‚Äôs trash hands that would have a flush
draw on a two-tone board. For these reasons, IP will be able to triple barrel more effectively on
rainbow flops and get all the money in by the river.

### TOPIC: Developing IP C-betting Strategies
The first thing you should consider when deciding to c-bet is your opponent‚Äôs skill level. If the
Villain is a weak player who is completely oblivious, you can get away with doing pretty much
anything you want. If you think they are likely to call your overbets across three streets very
light, then you should by all means take them to value town any time you have a hand that is
ahead of their calling range.
 On the other hand, if you have a hand that has very little equity and bad blockers, you should
either give up or bet small, trying to take down the pot right there, and be ready to give up if your
first bet is called because this type of player will simply not fold, regardless of the bet-size you
choose. As with this example, there are many different situations where you should tweak your
bet-size and frequencies in order to manipulate your opponent‚Äôs range. The problem with making
these adjustments occurs when your opponent is smart, aware and capable of counter-
exploitation. Then, you need to have a solid strategy so you don‚Äôt get exploited instead.
 If the Villain is a good player, or at least you think that they will likely defend well on the
particular flop with the ranges in play, then there are two main concepts to consider:
 The flop GTO c-betting frequency
 The c-bet-size
 In this section, we focus on these two key factors and try to use them to develop our intuition
so we can more effectively develop our own c-betting strategies.
 All the simulations that were used to develop the data in this section had the familiar flop bet-
sizes: min-bets, 1/3-pot, 1/2-pot and 2/3-pot. We can categorize flop bet-sizes into two groups
according to the c-bet size that is preferred by the solver:
 Big bet-size: 1/2-pot, 2/3-pot
 Small bet-size: min-bet, 1/3-pot
 We can also categorize flops according to c-bet frequency as follows:
 High c-bet frequency flops (80%+)
 Mid c-bet frequency flops (60%-80%)
 Low c-bet frequency flops (less than 60%)
 In poker, it is rarely the case that something is true 100% of the time, and the equity buckets
system is no exception. Still, we can use the EQB diagrams to get a good idea of how the
players‚Äô equity distributions affect post-flop play by studying the EQB in the previously used
flop categories.
 In general, when a big bet-size is used by IP, the BB has the most depolarized range with
about 4-5% strong hands and a higher number of good hands, 19-36%. When a small bet-size is
used, the BB has 7-9% strong hands (twice as many strong hands) and a lower number of good
hands, 20-27%. So, IP sizes up when OOP has many hands that can potentially call the flop, and
sizes down when OOP potentially has more raising hands.
 Another interesting trend is how IP‚Äôs c-betting frequency increases as more trash hands are in
the BB‚Äôs range and decreases as the IP‚Äôs range becomes more depolarized. When the number of
strong hands in their range decreases, the number of good and weak hands in their range
increases.
 In practice, on 80%+ c-bet flops, you can get away with c-betting 100% of the time with little
to no EV loss, even against a minimally exploitative opponent. Due to IP‚Äôs massive range
advantage, there is little the Villain can do to attack the flop c-bets.
 On mid frequency c-bet flops, IP‚Äôs range still dominates the BB, but the ranges are now much
closer, as IP‚Äôs range becomes more depolarized by having fewer strong hands and more weak
hands than on high c-bet flops, while the BB‚Äôs range gets stronger. Because of this shift in the
range composition, IP cannot get away with c-betting at a high frequency without it costing EV,
even against weak players, as their ranges hit these flops too well, making it easy for them to
defend against flop bets. Instead of betting a merged range, IP splits their range, checking back
good, but not great hands that benefit from keeping the pot small and seeing a free turn card at a
high frequency, while c-betting a more polarized range, which results in bigger bet-sizes
becoming more dominant.
 Playing turns after checking back the flop can be challenging and, for this reason, I frequently
hear players come up with excuses to bet hands they should be checking back on the flop so they
don‚Äôt have to deal with playing difficult turns. One of the most typical arguments is that the bet
is a so-called ‚Äúinformation bet‚Äù. Some players are eager to make a flop bet with a weak hand that
would benefit from checking back and playing a small pot, only to get raised off the pot in
situations where the BB is likely to x/r the flop. Or, even worse, they will call the flop x/r only to
fold on a turn bet 100% of the time when they fail to improve. This is a massive mistake that
amateurs and even many pros make on a regular basis simply because they want to avoid losing
the ‚Äúbetting lead‚Äù. They are happy to put more money into the pot just to fold to aggression so
they can feel good about themselves for making a ‚Äúgood fold‚Äù.
 Playing poker is easier when you have the stronger range and you are the one making
 bets, putting your opponents to the test, but that cannot be an excuse for making -EV plays
 by overplaying your hands.
 Poker is not about trying to win every single hand you play by force, but instead about
 making the highest EV play every time.
 Sometimes the highest EV play is to simply give up.
 Learning how to balance your ranges so you are not an easy target, and being selectively
 aggressive and smart, is what makes the difference between a rookie and a top player.
General IP C-bet Guidelines
 You don‚Äôt need to know the exact range composition combo by combo. All you need to
 make educated decisions is to have a good idea of the composition of each player‚Äôs
 equity buckets.
 If your opponent has a lot of trash in their range, you should c-bet at a high frequency and
 expect to get many folds. If they have very few strong hands compared to you, you
 should size up!
 High c-bet % and big bet-size flops are the absolute best flops for IP. They allow for
 aggressive play and you should expect to capture most of the pot.
 Low c-bet % and small bet-size flops are the best flops for the BB. Equities run close and
 you should be cautious, generally betting small and at a low frequency.
 The types of hands that the solver likes to check back on the flop are generally the same.
 What changes is the frequency they are checked.
 Bet-folding high equity hands on the flop is a disaster. If your range is not strong enough
 to c-bet 100% without risking being x/r at a high frequency, you should split your range,
 c-betting a more polarized range and checking back good and weak hands that benefit
 from taking a free turn.
 If you do have a checking range on a given flop, check back strong hands that block your
 opponent‚Äôs continuing range, particularly if, on that flop, you are likely to get many folds.
 If you expect your opponent to fold a lot or raise your bet, you should bet small at a high
 frequency, and if you expect them to call a lot, you should size up.
 Don‚Äôt put yourself in areas of the game tree where you are not comfortable. It is a
 completely different thing to ask yourself how the solver would play a tricky spot and to
 ask what the best play you can think of right now is.
 It‚Äôs better to have a plan, even a simple plan, than have no plan at all.
 In multi-way pots, blockers are more important than raw hand strength.
 Generally, play passively in multi-way pots. Don‚Äôt bet draws too often unless they are to
 the nuts.
 Never think about a hand in a vacuum. Always think about the context.
 Hands with backdoor equity and no showdown value generally work well as semi-bluffs.
 If you have a checking range, make sure to check back strong hands with some frequency
 so you don‚Äôt get easily exploited by aggressive players stabbing at the pot after you
 checked.
 If you are unsure about the flop strategy with your range, you can default to c-betting 1/3-
 pot in most short and middle stack situations.
 If you are unsure whether you should bet or check your hand, ask yourself what would
 happen if you are raised. If your hand hates being raised and you are likely to face a x/r,
 then you should probably check.
 If the BB does not have a donk betting range on good donking flops, you should c-bet less
 often than equilibrium suggests because you will get x/r more often.
 If your hand can get value across three streets, it is almost always ideal to start by betting
 the flop.
 Don‚Äôt try to get recreational players off top pair. More often than not, they will not fold it.
The Way Ahead or Way Behind Situation
Sometimes IP‚Äôs range is so strong compared to the BB‚Äôs range that, even if they could profitably
c-bet 100% and get a lot of folds, the strategy involves checking back the flop at a high
frequency. This happens on flops where BB‚Äôs range is extremely polarized to strong hands and a
lot of trash with little in between.
Example
Board: A‚ô†T‚ô•T
Situation: BB vs UTG
Stack depth: 30bb
IP EQB: 57% strong hands, 37% good, 5% weak and 1% trash
BB EQB: 7% strong, 12% good, 0% weak and 81% trash.
 This situation is commonly known as way ahead or way behind because your opponent will
either have a monster or little to nothing, without much in between. In this set-up, IP wants to
check back the flop with many good hands for pot control, alongside a big chunk of strong hands
as traps. IP also wants to c-bet all trash hands and most weak hands, balanced with the remaining
strong and some good hands. This allows IP to often win the pot uncontested on the flop with
trash while being able to bluff-catch effectively on future streets after checking back the flop.
 When facing a x/r, you should always consider your opponent‚Äôs range and your hand vs range
equity. If the Villain is likely to x/r the flop less than equilibrium suggests, they will probably be
missing the optimal bluff. Their range will be heavily skewed towards strong hands and your
overall equity will be a lot lower than you would expect it to be. If that is the case, you can
exploit the Villain by over-folding the flop. Even if they bluff you once in a while, their
frequencies are so far off to the point that it is not worth the risk of continuing with middle
strength hands. Depending on the Villain, you can even lay down some strong hands you would
never consider folding against someone else.
 If Villain‚Äôs range is skewed towards draws, then you can 3-bet aggressively with your good
and strong hands that can benefit from protection. If the Villain‚Äôs range is polarized to strong
hands or bluffs, your range will play better as a bluff-catcher. Let them keep putting money in
with bluffs and don‚Äôt raise back with medium strength hands.
IP C-bet Examples
Flop Strategy Example 1
High c-bet % and big bet-size: BB vs UTG on A‚ô•Q3‚ô† (40bb)
 If we give IP the option to use a 120% overbet, the solver will use it 14.45% of the time,
although this does not generate any extra EV to IP. On the other hand, simplifying the strategy to
c-bet 100% for 1/3-pot bet-size loses 1.07% of the pot, or 6.6bb/100. Simplifying the strategy to
c-bet 100% using the 2/3-pot bet-size retains all of IP‚Äôs EV.
 On A‚ô•Q3‚ô†, UTG has all very strong hands, such as AA, QQ and AK, while the BB would 3-
bet AA and QQ all the time and AK most of the time. This lack of nutted hands in the BB‚Äôs
range allows IP to bet big across multiple streets, over-realizing the 72% equity and capturing
85% of the pot.
Facing a Min x/r
On this flop, IP has a massive range advantage and, at equilibrium, should only face a flop x/r
about 5% of the time. OOP‚Äôs x/r range contains hands such as 33, AQ, A3, Q3, AJ, a few AT-
A7, and bluffs such as gutshots and some bottom pair plus a BDFD and BDSTD.
 UTG‚Äôs typical response should be to fold about 30% of their range, including most pocket
pairs, K-high without a gutshot and pure air. UTG‚Äôs 3-bet range contains hands such as AK, AJ,
a small frequency of AQ, and about 5% of sets for value, plus some KJo, QJs and QTs without a
BDFD and about half of JJ as bluffs. 52% of UTG‚Äôs range calls vs the x/r and plays the turn
including any top pair, middle pair and gutshots.
Flop Strategy Example 2
High c-bet % and small bet-size: BB vs UTG on Q‚ô•J‚ô•T‚ô• (40bb)
 On Q‚ô•J‚ô•T‚ô•, UTG has a substantial range advantage, so they would like to c-bet at a high
frequency, but the BB‚Äôs range is too polarized, with many hands that would not be able to
continue on the flop if UTG used a big bet-size. At the same time, BB has many strong hands
that will be happy to continue vs a big bet-size. So, by betting big UTG would be making the
BB‚Äôs life easier, allowing them to correctly fold weak hands and continue with a very strong
range. If instead, UTG bets the minimum, this will lure the BB in with many weak hands that
UTG dominates, keeping their range wider on future streets.
 The strategy on this flop can be simplified to min-bet 100% with no EV loss. Many times,
when people see all the small frequencies being used, they freak out, thinking that playing with
that level of detail is impossible, and they are right. Only a solver would be capable of that kind
of mixing but, as we saw in the post-flop bet-sizing section, we don‚Äôt need to use multiple bet-
sizes, as a single bet-size will retain virtually all the strategy‚Äôs EV.
Facing a 50% Pot x/r
The BB x/r range on this flop includes many strong hands such as flushes, straights, sets and two
pair, alongside flush draws and straights draws and not too much pure air.
 UTG‚Äôs response to a flop x/r on this texture is to almost never 3-bet, folding about 35% of the
time and calling the remaining 65%. UTG‚Äôs continuing range includes pretty much all hands that
are two pair or better, a pair with a straight draw and pretty much any hand that has a flush draw.
Flop Strategy Example 3
Mid c-bet % and big bet-size: BB vs UTG on 9‚ô•8‚ô•4 (40bbs)
 On this flop texture, IP has 59% equity and is able to capture 69.04% of the pot. Simplifying
the strategy to a single 2/3-pot bet-size retains most of IP‚Äôs EV, 68.95%, for an EV loss of -0.09
or -0.6bb/100.
 A 100% c-bet strategy cannot be implemented on this flop as it would cost UTG an EV loss of
4.25% of the pot, or -24bb/100. At equilibrium, the BB‚Äôs x/r frequency vs UTG is about 4%, but
vs the 100% c-bet strategy, the BB can attack UTG by increasing the x/r frequency to a gigantic
48.42%.
 The UTG strategy breaks down as follows:
Strong hands
Strong hands are bet most of the time. Hands such as AA, top set and middle set get checked
back ~8%.
Good hands
Good hands are played passively, with made hands such as middle pairs mostly being checked.
Good draws such as combo draws and flush draws are mostly c-bet, while weaker draws such as
OESD mostly get checked. Top pair wants to check back 24% of the time and can be c-bet in a
reverse linear fashion, with the strongest kicker A9 being c-bet 100% and T9s being c-bet 66%.
Weak hands
The only weak hands in IP‚Äôs range that don‚Äôt have any sort of draw are K-high and A-high. In
general, combos with a BDFD get c-bet more often than combos without a BDFD.
Trash hands
The only hand with less than 33% equity in IP‚Äôs range is 65s, and it gets c-bet ~95% of the time.
Facing a MIN x/r
On this flop, the BB should only x/r about 4% of the time, given a lack of strong hands in their
range. The flop x/r range includes hands such as two pair, overpairs, combo draws and some
overcards with a BDFD.
 UTG‚Äôs response at equilibrium is to fold about 32% of the time, including mostly overcards
without a BDFD. UTG 3-bets all-in ~13.5%, and 3-bets a smaller size about 8% of the time. The
3-betting range includes hands such as overpairs, top pair top kicker and the nut flush draw
(particularly with two overcards) and some bluffs with hands such as A‚ô• plus an overcard. The
rest of the range calls, for a calling frequency of ~47%.
Flop Strategy Example 4
Mid c-bet % and small bet-size: BB vs BN on J‚ô†6‚ô•6 (40bbs)
 On this flop, the BB‚Äôs range is very polar and has a healthy number of strong hands at 14%,
not too far away from the BN‚Äôs 23%. More specifically, the BB‚Äôs range has 8.9% trip sixes,
while the BN only has 5%. For this reason, the BN cannot use a large sizing, but the BB still has
52% trash hands that will struggle to continue against even a min-bet. This allows the BN to
have a high overall c-bet frequency of 72%.
The BN strategy breaks down as follows:
Strong hands
Some strong hands such as quads (66) and full houses (JJ) block the BB‚Äôs continuing range, so
they benefit from trapping and checking back the flop with some frequency. This gives the
Villain the chance to either start bluffing or catch some equity. Also, IP‚Äôs range is protected
when they check back the flop. Overpairs QQ+ like checking back the flop with some frequency
when they block the BB‚Äôs BDFDs that would continue on the flop. So, a hand like K‚ô£K is more
likely to c-bet than a hand like K‚ô†K‚ô•.
Good hands
Good hands are pocket pairs TT-22 (except 66) and these are c-bet half the time.
Weak hands
Suited A-high gets c-bet linearly, with the strongest AK-AQs being c-bet 100%, then the
middling ones ATs-A7s being c-bet 80% and the baby A-high A5s-A2s being c-bet only 34%.
The logic is that the stronger A-highs have better equity vs the BB‚Äôs x/r range, so IP wants to
have them more often when facing a x/r. Also, they have better blockers to top pair, and get
called by worse A-high more often.
Trash hands
Air gets c-bet 75% of the time.
Facing a 50% Pot x/r
The total BB x/r frequency on this board is about 27%, with a polarized range including some
strong hands such as trips, a few good top pairs and some very weak hands such as BDFD and
BDSTD combos.
 The BN‚Äôs equilibrium response to the x/r has them folding about 35% of hands, 3-betting 11%
using a min-raise and calling 54%. The BN‚Äôs folding range includes all air, and many weak A-
and K-high with only one overcard to the flopped J. The BN‚Äôs 3-betting range is extremely
polarized, including hands such as A6 and K6, some strong top pair, and some bluffs with two
overcards with a BDFD or BDFD and BDSTD. The calling range contains any pair+, most A-
and K- and Q-high and hands with backdoor equity.
Flop Strategy Example 5
Low c-bet % and big bet-size: BB vs BN on 8‚ô•62‚ô† (40bbs)
 On 862r, the BB has few strong hands compared to the BN. This incentivizes the BN to use a
big bet-size. However, the BN also has many good and weak hands that benefit from playing a
small pot and taking a free turn card. These range distributions results in a more polarized big
bet-size with a low c-bet frequency.
 The IP player strategy breaks down as follows:
Strong hands
It is important for IP to have some strong hands that can continue on brick runouts. For this
reason, some strong hands such as top set and top pair weak kicker get checked back with some
frequency. In fact, top set wants to check back or bet small. Since I advocate one bet-size by
flop, I think a good strategy would be to simply always check back top set in this spot. A trend
that typically loses a lot of EV to IP that I see all the time is to c-bet all strong and good hands on
the flop and checking back an unbalanced and capped range that can be attacked by the BB on
future streets.
Good hands
Good hands really want to check back a lot and realize equity instead of being raised off the pot.
Middle and low pocket pairs mostly want to check back the flop, except 77, which can be bet
half the time, as it can get value from middle pair. The strongest middle pairs such as A6 and K6
are mostly c-bet and the weaker ones are typically checked back. Bottom pair top kicker is
mostly c-bet, and the rest are checked back. Ace-highs without a BDFD are c-bet reverse linearly
(A6o is c-bet more often than AQo) except AKo, which is mostly bet and the ones with a BDFD
are c-bet linearly (AKs is c-bet more often than A3s).
Weak hands
Weak hands are c-bet reverse linearly when they cannot call a flop x/r. For example, K6o gets c-
bet more often than K9o, which also gets c-bet more often than KQo. So, the strongest Kx that
will do well on many turns can be checked back, while the weaker ones better serve as bet/folds.
OESDs are mostly checked back, while gutshots and Q-high with two overcards are mostly c-
bet.
Trash hands
Weak Q-high, J-high and T-high with no draws are c-bet more often than not, but you have to
give up and check back some of them because c-betting all your trash would make your c-betting
range too weak.
Facing a 50% Pot x/r
On 862r, the BB‚Äôs range does not have many strong hands, thus the equilibrium flop x/r
frequency is low, at ~8%. The x/r range mostly includes hands such as top pair good kicker,
some OESD, some weak hands like gutshot plus BDFD and some random overcards.
 The BN‚Äôs equilibrium response is to fold 43% of the time, call 34% and 3-bet all-in 23%. The
BN‚Äôs 3-betting range includes hands such as QQ-99, top pair good kicker+, and some random
two overcards with a BDFD such as KTs, Q9s, J9s and T9s. The calling range is pretty much any
pair, any gutshot or better draw and most overcards with a BDFD. Air and overcards with no
BDFD are always folded.
Flop Strategy Example 6
Low c-bet % and small bet-size: BB vs BN on 5‚ô•54‚ô• (40bbs)
 On this flop, the BN doesn‚Äôt have a significant range advantage, hence the preference for the
smaller bet-sizes. In fact, most of the BN range is made of good hands, giving a depolarized
distribution that will result in a low c-bet frequency, as many good and weak hands in the BN‚Äôs
range will benefit from checking back the flop.
 The IP player strategy breaks down as follows:
Strong hands
Strong hands are slowplayed ~28% of the time. Quads are mostly checked back, full houses are
checked back about 22% of the time, trips are almost always c-bet and overpairs get c-bet in a
reverse linear fashion. TT gets c-bet 76%, JJ 64%, QQ 50%, KK 40% and AA 22%, as the
bigger pairs need less protection and make great hands to call down on many runouts after
checking back the flop. A-high combo draws get c-bet ~55%.
Good hands
Good hands are c-bet ~59% of the time. Mid pairs 66-99 are c-bet almost 100%, OESD gets
mostly c-bet, gutshots mostly like to check back and A-high flush draws are c-bet linearly, with
the strongest kickers being c-bet more often than the ones with weak kicker. K-high and Q-high
flush draws gets c-bet reverse linearly, with the highest kickers being checked back more often
and weaker flush draws being c-bet ~ 2/3 of the time.
Weak hands and trash hands
Air gets c-bet about 64% of the time, getting mostly bet/folded vs a flop x/r and only continuing
when having a diamond BDFD and a small frequency when having a heart.
Facing a 25% Pot x/r
On 5‚ô•54‚ô•, the BB isn‚Äôt as polarized as it was on J66r because, on 5‚ô•54‚ô•, many of the BB‚Äôs
hands that would be trash on J66 now have a flush draw, OESD or some sort of gutshot. This
makes the BN c-bet the flop less frequently on 5‚ô•54‚ô•. The BB should x/r the flop vs a 1/3-pot
c-bet with a range that has a good mixture of strong hands such as full houses, trips, flush draws,
SD, gutshots, and backdoor equity combos.
 The BN‚Äôs GTO strategy vs a flop x/r has them 3-betting the flop 19% of the time using a 25%-
pot raise, calling 56% and folding 25%.The BN‚Äôs 3-betting range includes hands such as 38% of
trips (mostly with a high kicker), 34% overpairs (mostly JJ-66), 26% of flush draws (mostly A-
high flush draws with two overcards) and some A‚ô• and K‚ô• bluffs. The folding range is mostly
air and overcards with no draws or backdoor BDFD. The calling range is made of any pair+ and
draws that are raised and overcards with BDFD.
Note About Mixing and Balancing
It is important to understand that all of the mixing that happens with all hand types across all the
range examples does not have to be memorized. It simply serves the purpose of illustrating how
the solver divides up the ranges. In-game against human opponents, the options with any given
hand tend to be more binary and one action will yield a higher expectation than any other action.
Mixing can be used as a defensive measure against good players but, even then, getting the exact
right frequencies often times is neither possible nor necessary.

### TOPIC: Developing OOP C-betting Strategies
OOP c-betting is fundamentally different from IP c-betting. When you are the player in position,
the Villain will generally be playing from the blinds with a wide range of about 50%-70% hands.
When the Villain cold calls (and is thus IP), their range will be much tighter, typically 4%-20%
hands. This significant difference in the Villain‚Äôs pre-flop range produces a more symmetric
post-flop equity distribution that results in a reduced overall betting frequency. The closer the
ranges are, the less incentivized you should be to start betting the flop.
 Now that you are OOP, there is another issue you don‚Äôt have when you are IP. Checking the
flop does not immediately allow you to see the turn and realize equity because, when you check
the flop from OOP, the IP player has the option to bet and force some of your hands to fold. For
this reason, you have to check a stronger range when OOP than when IP, as your range can be
immediately attacked by the Villain. This forces you to check a range that not only will be
balanced on the average turn card when the action goes x/x, but also a range that is balanced
immediately and can withstand aggression.
 Stack depth has a significant effect on pre-flop strategies and thus the cold call ranges will be
substantially different from one stack depth to the other, resulting in different post-flop equity
distributions. In this section, we will focus on BN cold calls because the BN is the position from
outside the blinds that typically cold calls the most. As for the opener, we will focus on CO and
UTG opens, to provide the two most extreme examples of this set-up, one against the widest
possible opening range, and once against the tightest. The play from all other positions will fall
within these two extremes.
 The stack depths we will study are 40bb and 20bb, typical for a MTT setup with 12.5% antes,
and the following betting structure:
 OOP can bet (20bb): all-in, 2/3-pot, 1/2-pot, 1/3-pot, min-bet
 OOP can bet (40bb): 3/4-pot, 2/3-pot, 1/2-pot, 1/3-pot, min-bet
 The best situation for Hero is when is playing UTG with 40bb. In this set-up, both players
have almost the same number of hands in their ranges but Hero‚Äôs range dominates the BN in all
other set-ups. The BN‚Äôs range is tighter than Hero‚Äôs, creating a more equal situation that will
ultimately benefit the BN, given that they are playing IP post-flop.
 Of course, for the BN to achieve this favorable post-flop situation, they had to take a risk
when calling the open raise in the first place. So it is not as if the BN could simply cold call any
hand, as they would risk being pushed off by the blinds and also risk playing multi-way post-
flop, which will reduce their share of the pot.
Ranges in Play
The following hand ranges identify the ranges in play for the subsequent analysis (Hand Ranges
341-348)
 Hand Range 341: CO RFI 40bb
 ‚Ä¢ Open 2.3x 36.4% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 63.6%
Hand Range 342: BN vs CO 40bb
 ‚Ä¢ 3-bet 7.5% / ‚Ä¢ Call 19.6% /
 ‚Ä¢ Fold 72.9%
Hand Range 343: UTG RFI 40bb
‚Ä¢ Open 2.3x 15.8% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 84.2%
 Hand Range 344: BN vs UTG 40bb
‚Ä¢ 3-bet 5.2% / ‚Ä¢ Call 15.9% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 78.9%
Hand Range 345: CO RFI 20bb
‚Ä¢ Open 2x 31.8% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 68.2%
 Hand Range 346: BN vs CO 20bb
‚Ä¢ All-in 12.3% / ‚Ä¢ Call 8.4% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 79.2%
Hand Range 347: UTG RFI 20bb
‚Ä¢ Open 2x 15.9% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 84.1%
 Hand Range 348: BN vs UTG 20bb
 ‚Ä¢ All-in 4.6% / ‚Ä¢ 3-bet 0.3% /
 ‚Ä¢ Call 12.2% / ‚Ä¢ Fold 82.9%
 Overall, the strategies could be simplified to two bet-sizes, a big bet-size and a small bet-size,
depending on the flop. With 40bb, you can use 3/4-pot and min-bet or 1/3-pot, and with 20bb
2/3-pot and min-bet or 1/3-pot. I did not test 1/4-pot bet-size, but I think it would probably work
well and could potentially replace the min-bet and 1/3-pot. With deeper stacks, overbets should
be introduced to the play.
 UTG c-bets a lot more frequently than the CO. In fact, the CO‚Äôs range is in general weaker
than the BN‚Äôs and CO could easily opt for a 100% checking strategy with minimal to no EV loss.
This is similar to the BB vs IP situation where the BB can opt to never donk bet the flop. This
strategy works well as an exploit against the population because most players tend to
automatically bet the flop when OOP checks to them, whereas the equilibrium strategy is to take
a stab at the pot half the time. Checking the flop with all hands allows Hero to play an aggressive
check/raising strategy, taking advantage of IP‚Äôs aggression, while reducing the effective SPR and
positional disadvantage.
 Many players make the mistake of c-betting way too often when OOP, particularly with weak
and trash hands, only to x/f the turn most of the time. This is a serious leak that can be easily
attacked by observant opponents who can call the flop bet and then fire the turn 100% of the time
when checked to.
C-betting Range Strategy Overview: UTG vs BN 40bbs
Much as with IP c-bets, OOP c-betting will heavily depend on the board. In this section, we will
examine UTG vs BN 40bb deep c-betting to get an overall picture of how the strategies change
when compared to playing IP.
 Even when OOP, UTG‚Äôs range is still strong enough to c-bet most of the time, checking the
flop 32% on average. Strong hands are checked 19% of the time, which is more than 3x as often
as when Hero is IP. Checking the flop does not immediately lead to a turn card, so Hero still has
to worry about IP betting after the flop check. For this reason, Hero needs to have, on average, a
stronger and more balanced checking range, allowing Hero to x/r the flop at a reasonable
frequency, thus offering protection him from IP betting too often with a large sizing when
checked to.
 When Hero is IP, the trash hands are generally c-bet more often than good and weak hands,
making this c-bet range more polarized. However, when Hero is OOP, this role reverses and
good and weak hands are c-bet more often than trash hands. The reason for this is that Hero still
has to act first on the turn, which will give away information about their hand strength. If they
bet too many low equity hands when OOP, their average turn range will be too weak and
consequently exploitable. For this reason, instead of putting in many chips with a lot of trash
hands only to later give up the pot, Hero simply checks them with the intention folding most of
the time vs a flop bet. Given that their checking range also has more strong hands than when they
are IP, Hero can expect the flop to go x/x more often, realizing equity for free.
 The texture most c-bet is trips. Hero has more overpairs and premium overcards that will turn
big pairs more often than IP, and IP‚Äôs range has many suited, connected type hands that are
complete trash and often have to fold. Paired boards are c-bet very often and, contrary to IP vs
BB situations, Hero as OOP uses big bet-sizes on paired boards, particularly on low rank flops.
When the Villain is in the BB, their range is much wider and can connect with trips in multiple
ways, but when they are on the BN, the number of hands that make trips is way lower. This
creates a situation where IP‚Äôs range will be capped, while OOP is uncapped, allowing OOP to
use a large bet-size, particularly on low and middle boards.
 The OOP player has a significant polarization advantage on rainbow flops, allowing them to
use bigger sizes more often. On the two-tone flops, the equity and EQR of many of OOP‚Äôs strong
hands gets reduced due to the presence of the flush draw, resulting in a reduced c-betting
frequency. Monotone boards improve IP‚Äôs equity distribution substantially. This results in OOP
using a small bet and c-betting only about 50% of hands.
 On Axx and high card flops, OOP has the range advantage and c-bets most of the time, while
on middle and low flops the equity distributions are symmetric, resulting in OOP playing a lot
more passively.
 IP‚Äôs range connects well on boards where there are possible straights and boards with straight
draws, because the BN‚Äôs cold call range has a lot of suited connectors and middle to small pocket
pairs. For this reason, OOP plays more passively on this type of dynamic board, while static
disconnected boards with no possible straights are better for Hero because they don‚Äôt improve
IP‚Äôs range as much.

### TOPIC: C-betting in 3-bet Pots
In a 3-bet pot, the ranges in play are generally narrower than in a single raised pot. Additionally,
the way pre-flop ranges are constructed generally result in a more polarized post-flop equity
distribution for the pre-flop aggressor and a more condensed distribution for the pre-flop caller.
In this section, our study will focus on both IP and OOP c-betting strategies, with starting stacks
of 40bb and a typical MTT 12.5% ante structure with pre-flop GTO ranges. I recommend going
over Chapters 8 and 9 and reviewing the pre-flop 3-betting and calling ranges for the following
match-ups.
40bb Effective Stacks: Hero is the pre-flop aggressor and the Villain is the caller.
IP 3-betting
BN vs CO / BN vs MP / BN vs EP / CO vs MP / CO vs EP / EP vs EP
OOP 3-betting
BB vs BN / BB vs CO / BB vs EP / SB vs BN / SB vs CO / SB vs EP
Post-flop SPR: 1.7 to 2.
C-bet-sizes: all-in, 1/2-pot, 1/3-pot, 1/4-pot.
 Something very interesting is how the solver manages to create such similar post-flop
situations from the different pre-flop ranges, particularly when IP 3-bets. The players‚Äô equities,
EQR and EVs are uniform across the board. In fact, the EQB are also similar and this results in
IP c-betting strategies being uniform for most of the match-ups.
 In 3-bet pots, the pre-flop aggressor will generally have a polarization advantage, with almost
a 2-to-1 strong hand advantage, a 1.5-to-1 good hand advantage and with 1/3 of the calling
player‚Äôs range being trash hands. This equity distribution results in small bet-sizes being
generally preferred, particularly when Hero is IP.
IP 3-bet Strategy Overview
After 3-betting IP, Hero‚Äôs strategy on the flop will be to mostly use a small bet-size. The strategy
could easily be simplified to only 1/4-pot bet. On average, IP checks back the flop 38% of the
time. In my experience, most players tend to c-bet the flop way more than they should because
they tend to always c-bet their air. This trend happens because the population does not x/r the
flop in 3-bet pots as aggressively as they should, which allows IP to profitably c-bet trash hands.
Therefore a good counter-adjustment from OOP would be to step up the x/r frequency in 3-bet
pots.
 Given that IP has a substantial checking back range, many strong hands are checked back,
particularly when they block the Villain‚Äôs continuing range. For example top set QQ on Q82r
gets checked back 68% of the time.
 Trips and rainbow paired flops are the most frequently c-bet textures, with two-tone and
monotone flops being the least frequently c-bet. On two-tone flops, OOP has a great spot to x/r
with many flush draws, which would force Hero off the pot. For this reason, two-tone flops are
checked back at a high frequency, allowing many of IP‚Äôs good and weak hands to realize equity.
 Low and Kxx boards are the most frequently c-bet ranks. Middle boards with possible straight
draws are checked back with a medium frequency because they connect very well with OOP‚Äôs
range, but IP still has plenty of overpairs in their range. Qxx and Jxx flops, on the other hand,
connect well with the pre-flop caller‚Äôs range and also demote many of IP‚Äôs hands to second or
third pair, making IP more incentivized to check back.
 Axx is an interesting board. The population tends to c-bet Axx flops pretty much 100% of the
time. However, in simulations, Axx boards are static and polarize OOP‚Äôs range as they will
either have a strong hand, a medium strength hand that cannot call multiple bets, or a lot of trash
that cannot continue on the flop, but won‚Äôt improve much on most turns. Given those hand
values will not change much and, with a low SPR, all the money can easily go in on two streets.
For this reason, checking back the flop in order to get additional information from OOP when
they have to act on the turn makes a lot of sense, allowing IP to protect the flop check back range
with plenty of strong hands, while also realizing equity with medium strength hands.
OOP 3-bet Strategy Overview
On average, Hero realizes less equity when OOP compared to IP. When Hero is IP, it is possible
to check back a weaker range that will likely improve on the turn, while from OOP, Hero‚Äôs
checking range has to be balanced enough to face any aggression from IP. Some of the time Hero
also has to use bigger bet-sizes when OOP so as not to give too good a price to IP to continue
with a wide range. Using bigger bet-sizes also helps Hero by reducing the SPR, and with it the
positional disadvantage.
 The SB‚Äôs 3-betting range is, on average, a bit stronger than the BB‚Äôs range. This allows Hero
to c-bet slightly more frequently when in the SB compared to the BB.
 When OOP, Hero c-bets at a higher frequency across almost all flop textures, except for
monotone boards which will be c-bet at a similar frequency. From OOP, Hero will use bigger
bet-sizes compared to when IP.
 After 3-betting from the blinds, Hero likes to c-bet low boards at a high frequency, given they
have a stronger range with many overpairs. Middle boards get checked more often when they
have possible straights and straight draws. Qxx, Jxx and Txx boards are some of the most
checked boards because they connect well with IP‚Äôs range.
 An interesting difference is seen on Axx boards that get c-bet 77% of the time when Hero is
OOP but only 53% when Hero is IP. In both situations, the players‚Äô equity distribution is similar,
and so the main difference seems to be that now, playing OOP, Hero doesn‚Äôt want to give the
option to the Villain to have a free turn when IP. If the action goes x/x on the flop, it is Hero who
will have to act first on the turn, giving away more range information. So, Hero decides to
mostly bet on Axx flops and force IP to fold some weak hands on the flop with a higher
frequency, avoiding complications by taking a passive line too often.

### TOPIC: C-bet Defense
In no-limit hold‚Äôem, c-bet defense is highly susceptible to bet-sizing. Some players like using
MDF as pseudo-GTO strategy, but as we have already pointed out, while this number could in
some instances serve as a rough guideline, it does not take equities and range distribution into
account.
 Basing your entire strategy on MDF will be highly detrimental.
 For example, in the BB vs UTG 40bb situation, if UTG bets 1/3-pot then, according to MDF,
the BB is supposed to defend 75% of the time. However, on a flop such as AQ3r, the BB‚Äôs range
has 70% trash hands and 10% weak hands. On average, the BB‚Äôs trash hands have 16% equity
against UTG, but the pot odds laid by UTG‚Äôs bet-size are 20%. So even against the 1/3-pot bet-
size, calling many of those hands will be -EV.
 Raising would be even worse, as that puts even more money into the pot vs a strong range that
will not fold enough to make the bluff profitable. In this situation, the BB‚Äôs GTO defense
strategy vs the 1/3-pot bet-size has them folding 58% and defending only 42% of the time, which
is nowhere near the 75% MDF. On this flop, the UTG can get away with c-betting their entire
range and there is nothing the BB can do to stop them from having a profitable bet with any two
cards.
 So, if you are holding something like a 96s with a BDFD, a weak king-high or a small pocket
pair and have about 10-20% equity, you should simply fold even if the Villain is betting ATC.
Your pre-flop call was profitable and there will be other flops where your range will be much
stronger and you will either connect a strong hand, have a better bluffing opportunity, or your
opponent will simply check back more often, allowing you to realize more equity.
 Never try forcing matters! Your goal is not to try to win every hand you play, but to play
 each hand in the most profitable way. If calling and raising are -EV plays, then folding,
 which is always 0 EV, will be the highest EV play.
 You must be disciplined enough to make the right play.
 When facing a bet, it is of vital importance to always consider the Villain‚Äôs range that will take
that specific line. For example, when facing a min-bet, your pot odds will be amazing, but the
Villain will use a different range composition compared to when they bet the size of the pot. This
will have an effect on your strategy because your hands will have different equities depending on
how the Villain constructs their various betting ranges. If the Villain is the type of player who
will always c-bet strong hands and check back medium strength hands in a given spot, many of
the bottom of range hands you would defend against a GTO player will have way lower equity
against this unbalanced strategy. You can exploit this poor range construction by overfolding the
flop.
 In this section, we will examine in detail the BB vs IP c-bet defense match-up in a single
raised pot with 40bb stack depths. Our focus will once again be on BB vs BN and BB vs UTG,
so we can compare the BB‚Äôs strategy against both the widest and the tightest possible ranges. In
this match-up, IP can c-bet 1/4-pot, 1/3-pot, 1/2-pot, 2/3-pot and the BB has the options to x/r
50% pot, x/r 25% pot, call and fold. (The 25% raise size results in a smaller bet-size than 2x the
original bet-size when IP uses the 2/3-pot bet, so it was rounded up to a min-raise in the GTO
simulations).
40bb Single Raised Pot BB vs IP
 The BB‚Äôs range is weaker against UTG than against the BN. This results in the BB folding on
average more hands when facing a c-bet from UTG than when facing a c-bet from the BN.
BB vs IP: Strategy Overview
In general, you want to x/r to a larger size when the Villain bets small, and x/r smaller when
Villain uses a larger bet-size. The BB needs to create some sort of indifference for IP‚Äôs c-betting
range. If the BB uses only the 25% x/r size, this could create a bias in IP‚Äôs strategy because the
weaker hands will never be priced out of the pot, as the total cost of bet/calling a hand against a
flop x/r will always be smaller when Villain decides to min-bet the flop.
 Increasing the raise size when the Villain bets small keeps their lowest equity hands
indifferent to calling and folding. Similarly, when IP uses a large bet-size, the BB does not have
to make a large raise that could be over-committal. Often a check-min-raise suffices. An
exception to this rule would be in the case of all-in raises, as they get a better risk/reward ratio
when IP‚Äôs bet-size is large.
 The smaller IP‚Äôs bet-size, the more depolarized their betting range will be. This allows the BB
to increase their overall x/r frequency.
 The BB‚Äôs folding range is composed mostly of trash, so the BB‚Äôs total number of trash hands
is the main factor when determining their overall folding frequency.
 Strong hands mostly want to x/r the flop, but many are also x/c with the intention to x/r on a
later street. This keeps the BB‚Äôs x/c range protected. Good hands mostly want to call, but some
of them want to x/r, particularly the combos that might need protection and unblock the Villain‚Äôs
continuing range, such as top pair in middle boards, bottom two pair on high boards and combo
draws that would benefit from getting all the money in on the flop or reducing the SPR so they
cannot be easily pushed off the pot on the turn.
 Weak hands are mostly x/c, but almost 1/3 of them get folded and about 15% get x/r. Trash
hands are mostly folded, but some get x/c and a few of them work well as x/r bluffing combos.
General BB C-bet Defense Guidelines
 Avoid splitting your range early in the hand unless you have many strong hands you can
 distribute in a x/r and x/c range.
 Generally use large x/r bet-sizes against small c-bets, and small x/r sizes against large c-
 bets, except for against all-in bets that give a better risk:reward ratio.
 In general, flop x/r ranges are polarized, including made hands that are happy to get in vs
 a 3-bet and hands that are fine raise/folding. A losing proposition is to x/r good hands that
 are not good enough to get in on the flop while at the same time are too good to fold vs a
 raise. Think ahead and avoid putting yourself in tough spots.
 If your hand has a lot of equity but not too much showdown value, or if it is vulnerable to
 losing a lot of value in future streets, consider playing aggressively with the intention of
 getting the money in while your hand is still valuable.
 The deeper the stacks, the stronger the average hand you need to x/r the flop. Good draws
 that can be barreled across various streets increase in value.
 When a x/r is a possible strategy, always consider the blocker effects. A value hand that
 does not block the Villain‚Äôs continuing range makes a better x/r than one that does. For
 example, 44 on 9‚ô•8‚ô•4‚ô• makes a better x/r than 99. The opposite is true for bluffs. A
 bluff combo that blocks the Villain‚Äôs continuing range is more valuable than one that
 blocks the Villain‚Äôs bluff combos. If your hand blocks both bluffs and value, then try
 thinking about other variables that could sway your decision one way or the other.
 It is tough to x/c bottom pair across multiple streets, especially if the pair is small.
 Consider putting some of your bottom pairs in your flop x/r range.
 A-high and K-high are decent hands in many spots. Don‚Äôt be so quick to give up on them
 on the flop, especially if your opponent bets small.
 If your range has a lot of trash hands, you should fold a lot of it vs a c-bet, regardless of
 your opponent‚Äôs bet-size and the MDF.
 Don‚Äôt try to represent a small value range and hope your opponents will lay down a big
 hand. That just won‚Äôt happen often enough.
 Always be aware of the Villain‚Äôs bet-size and pot odds offered. Be realistic about your
 outs and equity.
 Your flop x/r range won‚Äôt necessarily consist of your strongest hands but, instead, hands
 that benefit from lowering the SPR and that have the right blockers (forward and
 reverse).
 Don‚Äôt be afraid to play aggressively on a flop where you have a lot of strong hands in
 your range.
 Flush draws and OESD are good hands, but they are not the nuts. You don‚Äôt have to x/r
 the flop every time you have a decent draw. It is important to have good board coverage
 in your x/c range too.
 Before snap folding your hand when you miss the flop, think for a few seconds about the
 way the equities are distributed on the flop. Consider how often the Villain should be
 betting the flop and how likely they are to fold to a flop x/r.
BB C-bet Defense Examples
Flop Strategy Example 1
BB vs 2/3-pot c-bet: BB vs UTG on A‚ô•Q3‚ô† (40bb)
 AQ3r is a horrible flop for the BB, who will only be able to capture 14% of the pot (half of
their equity). In this match-up, most of the BB‚Äôs range becomes trash hands with almost no hope
to improve. With only about 3% strong hands, there isn‚Äôt much the BB can do to stop UTG from
c-betting their range for a large bet-size, which forces a fold 68% of the time.
 The only set the BB has is 33 and it gets x/r 100% of the time.
 Two pair gets x/r 42%, with Q3s being x/r 100%. A3s is x/r 1/3 of the time. AQo gets x/r
 40% and AQs only gets x/r about 7%. A3 needs some protection and benefits from
 reducing the SPR, while AQs helps protect the calling range and can be x/r on a later
 street.
 Top pair is never folded on the flop and gets x/r about 15% of the time. If the BB happens
 to have AK, it gets x/r every time. AJ gets x/r 63% of the time and all the other Ax get x/r
 about 6%.
 Second pair gets folded 25% and never gets x/r. The strongest KQ gets called 100%. The
 middling QJ-Q9 get folded about 53% of the time when not having a BDFD and the
 weaker kicker Q8s-Q2s gets called 100%. In this set-up, mid pair low kicker has better
 equity than the mid pair high kicker because most of the time the kicker is live.
 Pocket pairs between the queen and the three are always folded. This includes some
 pocket pairs as big as JJ and TT that would make bad bluff-catchers, as they have only
 two outs which aren‚Äôt even clean outs.
 Bottom pair is folded 66%. They can get called or even x/r sometimes as they have a lot
 more equity than a pocket pair such as 77. Any 3x can have up to 5 outs (another 3 plus
 the kicker). In this case, the weaker kickers are also more valuable than the high kickers,
 and hands such as K3s get folded 100%, while a hand like 53s can be x/r 43%, x/c 20%
 and x/f 36.5%. Usually bottom pairs are not great hands to call down, but they work well
 as semi-bluffs.
 Big gutshots such as KJ can be called most of the time. The weaker KT and JT play a
 mixed strategy, sometimes calling and sometimes folding. Wheel gutshots that can make
 an A-5 straight can be x/r some of the time when they have a BDFD but are mostly
 folded when they don‚Äôt.
 King-high no draw and all the rest of the air makes up 48% of BB‚Äôs range and is simply
 folded every time.
Flop Strategy Example 2
BB vs Min-bet: BB vs UTG on Q‚ô•J‚ô•T‚ô• (40bb)
 On QJT monotone, the BB has a substantial equity disadvantage, with only 36% equity. They
are also only able to realize 79% of their equity, capturing 28% of the pot and folding, on
average, 38.26% of the time against a flop min-bet, looking to x/r 18% and x/c 43%.
 The straight flush makes only a tiny portion of the BB‚Äôs range but, when having it, the
 BB‚Äôs EV is more than 3x the size of the pot! On this flop, if the BB has a straight flush it
 is very unlikely for UTG to also have a flush as most of the possible hands that could
 make a flush are blocked by the board and Hero‚Äôs hand. For this reason, Hero will mostly
 slowplay the nuts. In the event that IP has an A-high flush or the A‚ô•, the money will go
 all-in most of the time regardless of how the BB plays their hand, so it makes sense for
 the BB to let IP do most of the betting.
 Flush combos get x/r most of the time. A-high and K-high flushes get x/r about 1/3 of the
 time, reverse linearly with the highest kickers being x/r less often than the low kicker. For
 example, A9s never gets x/r, A5s gets x/r 57% and A2s gets x/r about 88% of the time.
 Lower flush combos are x/r about 88% of the time.
 Straights are rarely x/r unless they have a flush draw, averaging a x/r frequency of 20%.
 The BB never has top set. Middle and bottom set are x/r about 22% of the time.
 Two pair is x/r about 17%.
 Top pair averages 44% equity on a board as connected as this one with so many flush,
 straight, set and two pair combinations. Top pair is simply not a strong hand on this
 texture.
 Weaker middle pair combos can be x/f most of the time and occasionally x/r. J9 and better
 can also be x/r with some frequency, and any Jx with a higher kicker plays a 100% call
 strategy.
 Weak bottom pairs (T8-T2) are almost always folded. T8 can get x/r a small frequency,
 and T9 can be x/r half the time. Bottom pair with a higher kicker is always called.
 Underpairs are always folded unless they have a flush draw.
 Combo draws are x/r about 1/3 of the time and x/c 2/3. The ones with showdown value
 such as AT or KJ with a heart are mostly called and the ones without showdown value
 can be x/r about half the time.
 On this flop, any high flush draw will either be a made hand or a combo draw. This leaves
 the flush draw category with mostly weak flush draws such as 76o and 55 type hands.
 This category gets x/r about 1/3 of the time and called 2/3.
 OESD will only continue if they are drawing to the nut straight. All 9x except 99 are
 folded 100%, A8o also gets folded 100%, Kx and A9 without a heart can be x/r about
 half the time and x/c the other half.
 All gutshots are folded unless they have a pair.
 A-high and K-high hands always have at least a gutshot.
 Air hands such as 7-high no draw are simply always folded.
Flop Strategy Example 3
BB vs 2/3-pot c-bet: BB vs UTG on 9‚ô•8‚ô•4 (40bbs)
 On 9‚ô•8‚ô•4, the BB‚Äôs range only has about 4% strong hands against UTG. This results in
UTG using a large bet-size and the BB having a low x/r frequency of about 4%. The BB‚Äôs
strategy consists of waiting until the turn to start splitting their range, depending on the runout.
This avoids revealing information about their range on the flop. If the UTG uses a 1/3-pot c-bet-
size instead, the BB increases their x/r frequency to ~15%. In general, flops with one or more
possible flopped straights are better for the BB, and flops without flop straights tend lower their
EV.
 Sets are only x/r about 12% of the time, with 99-88 being almost always called, and 44
 only getting x/r when it has a heart. The reason for this is that IP has the bigger sets so
 having a heart gives the BB a little extra equity in the case of running into a cooler
 situation. The idea of the BB having to x/r this flop every time they have a strong hand
 because of the possible straight and flush draws is unfounded as these draws only make
 up about 10.5% of UTG‚Äôs range. In this case, the lack of strong combos in the BB‚Äôs range
 and keeping their information advantage is more important for the BB than ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù
 the hand. In this situation, the BB compensates for the lack of flop aggression with an
 aggressive turn donking strategy on favorable runouts.
 Two pair are x/r about 18% of the time, with 98 and 84 being x/r more frequently than 94.
 Typically, the solver shows a slight preference to x/c top and bottom two pair when
 compared to top two and bottom two. Top two are the most nutted ones, so it makes
 sense to x/r them more frequently, and bottom two pair needs more protection and
 unblocks top pair, while top and bottom blocks top pair in the Villain‚Äôs range.
 Overpairs JJ-TT are the most x/r hands, as they have good equity but are vulnerable. JJ is
 x/r 100% and TT mostly x/r when having the T‚ô•.
 Top, middle pair and bottom always get x/c. 77-55 are almost always folded except for 77
 with a heart.
 Combo draws are x/r 1/3 of the time and x/c 2/3 of the time. Q‚ô•J‚ô• and Q‚ô•T‚ô• are x/r
 100%. J‚ô•T‚ô• and J‚ô•7‚ô• are x/r about 1/3 and lower combo draws are mostly x/c.
 Flush draws are only x/r about 10% of the time. The most frequently x/r combos are ATs-
 A5s ~60%
 OESD are x/c every time. These combos have good equity vs IP‚Äôs c-bet range but are too
 weak against IP‚Äôs flop 3-betting range as they will often be dominated by overpairs or
 flush draws.
 Gutshots with two overcards or a BDFD are called, the rest get folded.
 A-high is mostly folded, except AJ+ plus BDFD that gets called about 40%.
 K-high is mostly folded except for a few KQ with the K‚ô• that occasionally gets called.
 Air is folded 100% of the time.
Flop Strategy Example 4
BB vs Minbet: BB vs BN on J‚ô†6‚ô•6 (40bbs)
 On J‚ô†6‚ô•6, the BB‚Äôs range gets heavily polarized with a reasonable amount of strong hands
that connect trip sixes. This results in the BB having a healthy x/r range of about 27%, using
mostly the bigger x/r size.
 The BB never has quads as they would always 3-bet 66 pre-flop.
 Full houses are rarely x/r. J6 does not need any protection and it blocks IP‚Äôs top pair
 combos.
 Trips are x/r reverse linearly 80% of the time and x/c 20%. Trips with high kicker work
 better as x/c because they block IP‚Äôs overcards and overpairs.
 Top pairs with high and middle kickers are often x/r when they have a BDFD and x/c
 otherwise.
 Underpairs 44-22 are always x/c.
 A-high hands are always x/c.
 K-high, on average, gets x/r about 22% and x/c 65%. K6+ are almost always x/c and K-
 high with a low kicker mostly gets folded unless it has a BDFD.
 Air, Q7+ with a BDFD, gets x/r most of the time and x/c without a BDFD. Q5-Q2 with a
 BDFD are mostly x/c and sometimes x/r, and combos without a BDFD are mostly folded.
 The rest of the air combos are x/r most of the time and x/c sometimes when they have a
 BDFD and a BDSTD and otherwise folded.

### TOPIC: GTO TURN STRATEGIES
Given the sheer size of the possible turn strategies on all different lines and runouts it will not be
possible to take an approach as exhaustive as we did in the pre-flop and flop sections. However,
we will cover the most important concepts that drive GTO play on this street, applying the
overall knowledge we have built throughout this book.
 Turn play can be extremely challenging for many players, particularly if they are
inexperienced. However, in reality, turn play isn‚Äôt as different from flop play as it may appear.
 In order to make an educated decision, the main concepts you need to keep in mind are
 the pot size, the effective stacks, the ranges in play and the board.
 The stacks and pot size are obvious, so we are left with the ranges in play and the board. The
ranges in play can be deconstructed from the previous action taken by the players involved in the
hand. Assessing the distribution and polarization of the equity of different ranges after a given
action line is difficult for many players.
 GTO does not care, nor does it take into account, any history from the current or any past
hands. It does not care about the betting on the previous round, (x/x) or (x/b/c), or who was the
previous aggressor. All a GTO solver needs to compute the equilibrium strategy pair for two
players are the ranges in play, the board, the stacks, the pot size and a betting abstraction. The
hand history and players‚Äô actions leading to the decision point are what we humans need to know
so we can have an idea of the ranges in play.
 Knowing all the exact ranges for all players in all possible strategic lines by heart is clearly
impossible. We cannot compute the GTO strategy for each combo, nor can we memorize solver
strategies for every single spot. What we can do is focus our study on some of the key strategic
lines and familiarize ourselves with the general morphology of ranges, the equity distributions
and how they are affected by the board runout. Every decision point is simply a new puzzle with
new pieces. All you have to do is use your knowledge and expertise to put the pieces together
and make the best decision possible with the information you have. The only way to get really
good at solving that puzzle is through deliberate practice.

### TOPIC: Key Strategy Lines
In the same way as how the ranges in play are different on the flop depending on the pre-flop
action, the ranges in play on the turn will be different depending on the previous actions. There
are many different flop lines that lead to a turn, but not all of them are equally important. Some
lines will happen more frequently than others and will have a bigger impact on your long-term
expectation. These are called Key Strategy Lines and, just like when we studied the flop, we do
not have to look at every single line leading to a turn in order to understand turn play. We will
only focus on some of the key strategy lines to understand turn play.
 In this section, we will continue with the Flop Strategy Examples 1, 2, 3 and 4, focusing our
study on turn play after the flop action goes x/x and the action goes x/b/c.
Flop Line: IP Checks back (x/x)
 OOP First Action (x/x/?)
 IP vs Bet (x/x/b/?)
 IP vs Check (x/x/x/?)
 OOP Check vs Bet (x/x/x/b/?)
Flop Line: IP C-bets & OOP Calls (x/b/c)
 OOP First Action (x/b/c/?)
 IP vs Donk bet (x/b/c/d/?)
 IP vs Check (x/b/c/x/?)
 OOP Check vs C-bet (x/b/c/x/b/?)

### TOPIC: Turn Play After Flop Check Back (x/x)
IP Range
If IP is checking back a GTO strategy, then their range will have the right board coverage and be
fairly balanced on most runouts. Still, IP‚Äôs checking back range will be somewhat capped and a
lot more depolarized than their c-betting range as they would have c-bet most of their strong
hands on the flop.
OOP Range
If OOP doesn‚Äôt have a donk betting range, then they have exactly the same range with which
they called the pre-flop raise. This means two things. First, this range is very wide compared to
IP‚Äôs range, and second, that this range is still uncapped.
 The way the ranges are constructed is somewhat reverse of the flop situation, making OOP‚Äôs
range more polarized than IP‚Äôs and IP‚Äôs range more condensed than OOP‚Äôs. This range
distribution generally results in OOP developing a turn betting strategy.
 If IP is checking back a non-GTO range, this range will lack the right board coverage and will
be heavily capped on many different runouts while being overly represented on others. For
example, let‚Äôs consider the flop strategy Example 3 of 9‚ô•8‚ô•4‚ô•. If IP never checks back hands
such as 99 and 88, then OOP‚Äôs turn strategy on a blank turn such as 2‚ô£ drifts from betting 27%
of the time to betting 77% of the time, and IP‚Äôs EV decreases from 54% of the pot on that
specific turn card to 41%. The effect is even greater if IP never checks back a flush draw or any
strong hand on the flop. Then if a flush card such as the 5‚ô• comes, IP‚Äôs EV decreases to 11%.
 You should also be aware when IP checks back a flop that should be c-bet at a high frequency.
For example, on AQ3r, if IP checks back they almost always have some sort of made hand and
not much air, because people intuitively understand they should c-bet that flop at a high
frequency but still struggle to bet hands such as A with a low kicker, KK, Qx, JJ and TT. This
strategy is terrible, as it results in IP‚Äôs range being pretty much face-up, allowing OOP to play
accurately against it. Sometimes players will also check back a hand such as AA, trying balance
the fact that they are checking back a weak capped range but this doesn‚Äôt help them as much as
they might think. When OOP has an A, there is only one combo of AA left, and this allows OOP
to play the Ax very aggressively without having to be too worried about IP having them beat.
This also allows OOP to check/fold quite effectively on the turn if IP decides to make a delayed
c-bet.
OOP First Action
 Checking back almost never happens at equilibrium on A‚ô†Q3‚ô† and Q‚ô•J‚ô•T‚ô•. For this reason,
IP‚Äôs range on the turn contains only 1.4 and 1 combos, respectively. This doesn‚Äôt mean that there
is a single hand IP is checking back, but that they are checking a tiny fraction of the time with a
wide variety of hands. This is, as we discussed before, something totally impractical and
unnecessary. Even if IP was checking a GTO range in this spot, this line would only happen less
than 1% of the time. Still, I wanted to include these flops so we have an idea of how OOP‚Äôs
strategy changes on the four different boards (Diagram 107).
 OOP has three different bet-sizes to choose from: 1.2x-pot, 2/3-pot and 1/3-pot.
 As we can see, the average OOP strategy will be different on the turn for the different flop
textures. This is again due to the different ranges the players will have on each board, and also
because of how the ranges interact with each of the boards.
 The OOP strategy when first to act on the turn will also be different within each one of these
flops depending on which turn card is dealt.
IP vs Bet
 On 9‚ô•8‚ô•4, IP raises a 1/3-pot bet 19% of the time and never raises an OOP overbet on
J‚ô†6‚ô•6 (Diagram 108). The reason is that, on 9‚ô•8‚ô•4, OOP‚Äôs betting frequency and bet-size are
smaller than on J‚ô†6‚ô•6 because the polarization of the ranges is different in both cases. On
9‚ô•8‚ô•4, OOP‚Äôs betting range is more condensed and IP has more strong hands, allowing IP to
have a raising range. On J‚ô†6‚ô•6, OOP‚Äôs range is more polarized and IP does not have that many
strong hands compared to OOP.
IP vs Check
 This line happens frequently, overall 14% of the time on 9‚ô•8‚ô•4 and 24% on J‚ô†6‚ô•6.
 On the average turn on 9‚ô•8‚ô•4, IP likes to bet 2/3-pot because OOP should not have too
many strong hands after checking twice on a board as dynamic as this one, because most of their
strong hands would bet at some point earlier.
 On J‚ô†6‚ô•6, IP mostly uses the 1/3-pot bet as this board is quite static. Most hands that were
strong on the flop will still be quite strong on the turn and the river, so OOP can afford to
slowplay and trap them without risking being outdrawn as often. Also, most hands that were
weak or trash on the flop won‚Äôt have improved on the turn and won‚Äôt improve too much on the
river. So, OOP is forced to play more passively on the turn, checking most of their range. In this
situation, OOP‚Äôs range will remain fairly polarized, so IP can take a stab at the pot using a small
bet-size and expect to get many folds (Diagram 109).
OOP vs Bet
 OOP folds slightly more to the IP stab on 9‚ô•8‚ô•4 because IP‚Äôs bet-size is bigger, making it
more difficult for OOP‚Äôs weak hands to continue. Also, OOP x/r the flop more on J‚ô†6‚ô•6
because their range is more polarized, and also because IP‚Äôs bet-size is smaller. If IP overbets the
pot instead, then OOP would only x/r about 3% hands on J‚ô†6‚ô•6 (Diagram 110).

### TOPIC: Turn Play After Flop C-bet and Call (x/b/c)
In general, IP will c-bet most strong and trash hands on the flop, making their flop c-betting
range more polarized. At the same time OOP will fold most trash and raise some of strong hands
against the flop c-bet. This makes OOP‚Äôs range more condensed coming to the turn after the
action goes x/b/c.
OOP First Action
 Equities run much closer after the flop goes x/c, but the overall polarization will, in general, be
in favor of the previous street‚Äôs aggressor and the caller will tend to have the most condensed
range.
 Since OOP‚Äôs range will typically be more depolarized than IP‚Äôs, we see a general trend from
OOP to check to IP (Diagram 111). However, similarly to the flop donk bet, there will be some
turns that will make OOP‚Äôs range more polarized and IP‚Äôs more condensed, resulting in an
increased OOP betting frequency.
 The solver typically likes to use small bet-sizes when donk betting the flop compared to
betting the turn after a x/x flop. This is because of the difference of the polarization of the ranges
in both cases.
IP vs Donk Bet
 Since turn donk bets aren‚Äôt as common as on the flop, this line happens rarely. Because in
most situations IP has position and an uncapped range, they won‚Äôt be folding a lot vs the donk
bet and, instead, will be raising at a high frequency (Diagram 112).
 Even in modern games, people still fail to donk bet the flop as often as they could and many
players will simply auto-check the turn without giving much thought about how it affects the
ranges.
IP vs Check
 This line happens frequently, probably even more so in real games as most people fail to donk
bet the flop nearly as much as the GTO solver recommends. In general, after the flop goes x/b/c
and OOP checks one more time on the turn, IP‚Äôs range will be very polarized and OOP‚Äôs range
will be mostly condensed. This effect gets magnified on some turn cards that give way more
strong hands to IP than to OOP, resulting in IP preferring bigger bet-sizes, and in some cases
even overbets (Diagram 113).
 On A‚ô•Q3‚ô†, OOP‚Äôs range will still be capped on most turn cards. For this reason, we see IP
continue to bet 2/3-pot with the intention to jam the river at a high frequency.
OOP vs Turn C-bet
 Facing a second barrel puts OOP in a tough spot. At this point, OOP will have a reasonable
equity disadvantage, their range will be very depolarized and IP‚Äôs range will be even more
polarized than it was on the flop (Diagram 114).

### TOPIC: Turn Categories
There are 49 possible turn cards for every single flop, and each turn will impact the ranges in
play in some way. This will consequently affect the players‚Äô GTO strategies. In this sense, turn
play is not so different to flop play where players have to be mindful of the way the board runout
affects the equity distributions, while at the same time being aware of the possibility of a new
card coming and impacting equities again on a later street.
 Studying each individual turn for every single flop would also be highly inefficient. For this
reason, we will need some sort of turn groupings in a similar way to how we previously created
the flop groupings.
 Most turn cards can be categorized as being in one or more of the following groups:
 Paired Board: Turn cards that pair the board.
 Flush: Turn cards that complete a flush.
 Straight: Turn cards that complete an OESD.
 Ace: The ace is a special card and it often has a significant effect.
 Overcard: Turn cards higher than top pair.
 Brick/Blank: Turn card that doesn‚Äôt connect with the board in a meaningful way.
 The overcard and undercard categories can be subdivided into cards that bring a backdoor
flush draw and cards that don‚Äôt.
Flop Strategy 1: Turn Play after Flop Checks Back (x/x)
OOP First Action: BB vs UTG on 9‚ô•8‚ô•4 (40bb)
 On 9‚ô•8‚ô•4, OOP has the polarization advantage on many turn cards, resulting in a high
betting frequency (Diagram 115).
 In general, low cards that complete straights, a 9, 8 or 4 pairing the board, and hearts are good
turns for OOP (Diagram 116). Overcards to the board that don‚Äôt complete many straights, and
particularly the aces, are good for IP. The effect of the turn card suit is seen in Diagram 117.
 OOP does well on the average turn card, with 48% equity, and over-realizes it to win 53% of
the pot. The worst possible turn cards for OOP are offsuit aces such as A‚ô†/A‚ô£ where their EV
decreases to 25.8%. The best possible turn cards are offsuit 5x such as 5‚ô†/5‚ô£ where their EV
increases to 64.17% of the pot. Notice how there is a correlation between OOP‚Äôs EQ and EV,
although the highest EQ card is not necessarily the highest EV card (Tables 134-137).
 The EQB charts for the A‚ô† and the 5‚ô† turn cards demonstrate just how much range
morphology can vary according to the runout, even after the same action line on the same flop
(Diagram 118). This has a substantial impact on the players‚Äô equilibrium strategies.
 Some players struggle to assimilate how a hand that was very strong on a previous street can
be demoted and become weaker on a later street. They get emotionally attached to the initial
value of their hand and feel entitled to win the pot just because they started with the strongest
hand. Nevertheless, this is just all part of the game.
 Poker is a game of equities, how much we have, how it is distributed and how we realize
 it while preventing our opponents from realizing theirs.
 On countless occasions I have heard players say something along the lines of, ‚ÄúEvery time I
have AA, the flush or the straight card comes. I‚Äôm so unlucky.‚Äù You are supposed to have your
strong hands demoted sometimes. It can be predicted mathematically and should be expected.
So, you should be prepared for the times it happens.
 Know your range, as well as your opponent‚Äôs and understand that, even if on that
 occasion you might lose a big pot sometimes, you will be the one who has the best of it. The
 important thing is to play well and adjust correctly to how the situations change. This
 allows you to prevail in the long run.
Flop Strategy 2: Turn Play after Flop C-bet and Call (x/b/c)
OOP First Action: BB vs UTG on 9‚ô•8‚ô•4 (40bb)
 After OOP x/b/c the flop, both players‚Äô equities will run very close on the average turn card
(Diagram 119). In fact, OOP has higher EQ (51.65%), but under-realizes it, capturing only
48.6% of the pot, while IP, with 46.6% EQ, captures 51.4% of the pot. Similarly to the flop donk
bet, on the turn OOP chooses to donk bet when IP does not have as many dominant strong hands
in their range and, instead, has many weaker hands that will benefit from checking back the turn
(Diagram 120).
 The best cards for OOP to donk bet the turn are 9, 8 and 4 that pair the board, 7, 6, 5 that
complete straights, and blank low offsuit cards. The worst cards to donk bet are the ones that
connect well with IP‚Äôs range, which are aces, high cards, and diamonds that would give the IP
player a BDFD (Diagrams 121-122).
 OOP does pretty well when the turn is a heart and will, on average, have more flush combos
than IP. However, OOP doesn‚Äôt lead them as often because the flushes aren‚Äôt as nutted as IP‚Äôs,
who will have more nut flushes in their range. The worst cards for OOP are offsuit kings, such as
K‚ô£/K‚ô†, and the best cards are offsuit 5s, such as 5‚ô£/5‚ô† (Tables 138-141).
 On a flop as dynamic as 9‚ô•8‚ô•4, both players‚Äô equity distributions will change drastically
according to the board runout (Diagram 123). This has a significant effect on the players‚Äô
equilibrium strategies, with OOP wanting to take advantage of the turn cards that give them a
massive range advantage by betting aggressively. Naturally, IP will choose to play more
passively in these situations.
IP vs Check: BB vs UTG on 9‚ô•8‚ô•4 (40bb) (x/b/c/x)
 Typically, the IP player will have a substantial polarization advantage after OOP has checked
twice. IP follows a similar trend we already saw on the flop, choosing to split their range. This
leads to c-betting once again with most of their strong hands and checking back most of their
good hands that don‚Äôt want to bet/fold and will benefit from seeing a free river. IP will c-bet over
65% of the time and will mostly use a 2/3-pot bet-size (Diagrams 124-125).
 The 9, 8 and 4 are bad cards for IP, but they still want to bet them at a high frequency when
checked to. This happens because IP expects OOP to have a high donk betting frequency on
those turn cards, so when they do check, their range will not have as many strong combos. At the
same time, there are many hands in OOP‚Äôs range that will not connect at all with the 9, 8 or 4.
So, by betting small, IP can still get many folds. On most other runouts, IP will bet a more
polarized range and opt to use a bigger bet-size (Diagrams 126-127).
 IP does extremely well on high cards, particularly the offsuit aces and kings. The heart ones
actually block many of IP‚Äôs flush combos and result in an EV drop (Tables 142-145).
OOP vs Turn 2/3-pot C-bet: BB vs UTG on 9‚ô•8‚ô•4 (40bb) (x/b/c/x/b)
 Facing the second barrel is not great for OOP. At this point, both players have split their
ranges several times. IP would be checking back a lot of medium strength hands and is now
betting with a very polarized range. OOP would have bet or raised many strong hands by now, so
their range is weak against IP‚Äôs turn c-betting range, resulting in OOP folding, on average, over
40% vs a turn c-bet. Most strong hands will be x/r on the turn, but some will still be slowplayed,
leaving OOP‚Äôs x/c range protected, even on brick runouts (Diagrams 128-129).
 On average, OOP will x/r the turn 14% of the time and will be mostly going all-in, as a
smaller raise size would commit too many chips. In general, their weaker x/r hands are semi-
bluffs that will have the equity to call an all-in bet and thus be committed (Diagrams 130-131).
 OOP has on average 45% EQ when facing a turn c-bet, but will only be able to realize 77% of
it, for a total EV of 21% of the pot. IP has an average EQ of 55%, and will over-realize it by a
large margin with an EQR factor of 144%, capturing 79% of the pot.

### TOPIC: GTO RIVER STRATEGIES
In a sense, the river is the easiest street to play, yet most players struggle with it. In fact, the river
is actually where the most mistakes are made and most of the money is won or lost. By the time
we get to the river, the pot will generally be a lot bigger than it was on the previous streets.
Bigger pots mean bigger bets (often all-in) and, with bigger bets, mistakes can get very costly.
 Calculating river equilibrium and exploitative strategies on a given runout from the players‚Äô
ranges, SPRs and betting abstractions in any decision point is relatively easy, especially with
modern GTO solvers. The river calculations typically take a split second. What makes the river
challenging is that it is the most difficult street on which to estimate players‚Äô starting ranges.
 At the beginning of each hand, all players have the exact same range: 100% or 169
strategically unique hands. As the players take different actions, their pre-flop ranges become
narrower, so the flop starting ranges aren‚Äôt too difficult to estimate either. During post-flop play,
the players‚Äô pre-flop ranges interact with the board in various ways and suits become relevant,
forcing us to keep track of specific hand combinations. Post-flop play depends on the way the
board runs out and the ranges derived from the previous street actions. All of this makes it
significantly more difficult to figure out the players‚Äô exact ranges the deeper we are in the hand.
Also, since most poker hands are over before showdown, players are a lot less experienced
playing the later streets. With all the possible runouts and ways to get to the river, it is no
surprise that most players struggle with river play.
 Fortunately, we don‚Äôt have to memorize every single action line and range getting to the river.
The river has some unique characteristics that simplify the calculations and make abstract models
and toy games particularly useful to accurately represent river scenarios.
 On the river there are no more cards to come, so the values of the hands are fixed. There
 are no draws, resulting in each hand having either 100% or 0% equity vs another hand.
 The hand vs range equity is simply the fraction of the opponent‚Äôs range the hand beats
 plus half of the hands it ties with, if there are any. For example, if a hand has 50% equity
 vs the Villain‚Äôs range, that means it is ahead of 50% of the Villain‚Äôs range and behind
 against the other half.
 There is a linear ordering of hands in terms of strength that is history independent. This
 means that the ranking of all possible river hands from strongest to weakest is the same
 no matter how they got there.
 There are no future street betting rounds to worry about. Any call or IP check in a heads-
 up pot immediately ends the hand and realizes equity.
Setting up a River Abstract Model
Setting up this model can be done as follows.
 List all river hands in both ranges in descending order of strength and split them according
 to who has them.
 Assign weights.
 Establish the blocker effects.
 Set up a game tree.
range (50% nut hands, 50% air), and Player2 having 100% bluff-catchers (hand 5) that always
lose to the nuts (hand 1) but wins against the bluffs (hand 10). If there are any blocker effects, we
can represent them in a matrix as follows (Table 151).
According to the blocker matrix:
 All hands block themselves
 Hand 1 blocks Hand 3
 Hand 3 blocks Hand 1
 Hand 6 blocks Hands 8 and 9
 Hands 8 and 9 block Hand 6
 All other hands do not block each other.
 Of course, a real river solution would include many more hands, with different weights and a
more complex blocker relationship, but in essence all you need to fully define a river situation
are the ranges table, the blocker relationship, and a game tree with the pot size, stack sizes and a
betting structure. This is, in fact, how all GTO solvers work. They have a list of all possible
rivers and which hands have blockers on each river. The hands are listed in order of strength and
the players‚Äô ranges tell the solver who has which hand and how often they have it. It doesn‚Äôt
matter how the players got to the specific river situation. As long as they arrive to the overall
same structure, the GTO strategy pair in that situation will be equivalent.
 For example, the nuts/air vs bluff-catcher situation can be described in a different way with
different hands. However, as long as one player has half of their range as the effective nuts, and
the other half being air relative to their opponent‚Äôs range, and the other player‚Äôs range is 100% of
bluff-catchers, then the GTO solution will be the exact same.
beat hands 8-9 in P1‚Äôs range and always loses to hands 2-3. This ranges structure and the ones
presented in Table 151 result in equivalent GTO strategies.
 This result is of vital importance. If we think about a game tree, there are thousands or
possibly tens of thousands of rivers that might come up, so we need to be able to categorize or
bucket them into types of scenario that we can identify and solve.
 For example, if you can recognize the river situation as being polar vs bluff-catcher, you will
know that the GTO strategy for the polar player is to always go all-in with their nut hands and
the Alpha % of their bluffs. and the bluff-catching player has to call with 1-Alpha of their range.
It doesn‚Äôt really matter if the nuts are a full house, flush, straight or any combination of those
hands. The only important thing would be the overall ranges composition where one player‚Äôs
range is 50% nuts and 50% air, and the other player‚Äôs range consists of 100% bluff-catchers.

### TOPIC: River Abstract Models
The river characteristics we just described make the [0-1] game we studied earlier the perfect fit
to analyze the mechanics of river play. In this section, we will look at several river abstract
models, compute them in a GTO solver and generate heuristics on how to approach the most
typical river situations players can expect to face.
River [0-1] Game Setup
Board: 2‚ô†2‚ô£2‚ô•23‚ô£
Pot: 100 chips
Stack: Players will start with 500 chip stacks, but we analyze examples with different stack
depths to understand the SPR effect on the equilibrium strategies.
Heads-up Pot: There are two players involved in the hand, P1 and P2.
Betting Structure: Both players are allowed to bet, x/r, call, go all-in and fold.
Players Hand Strength: This is represented in Table 153.
 AA is the strongest hand, 33 the weakest and suits will be set up so there are no blocker
effects. The blocker effect will be studied later.
 This discussion will be centered around two main groups of abstract models:
 Polarized with no ranges overlapping between the players.
 Linear models where both players can have any type of hand value.
Perfectly Polarized vs Bluff-catcher
The perfectly polarized (nuts/air) vs bluff catcher is the easiest river abstract model to study. We
should already be familiar with this river setup. If not, return to Chapter 2 for a quick refresher
on this example, as the next river situations will be a variation of this set-up.
 The effective stack size does not affect the general strategy. In this set-up, the polarized
player‚Äôs EV increases with bet-size, and so their equilibrium strategy is to always go all-in with
nut hands (KK-QQ) and bluff the air hands (77-66) with an Alpha frequency. Position also
doesn‚Äôt matter. P2 will never bet, and their strategy when facing a bet is to call 1-Alpha of the
time with all hands (JJ-88) (Table 154).
All of P1‚Äôs Range is Stronger Than P2‚Äôs Range
In the situation in Table 155, P2 has 0% equity in the pot. At equilibrium, P2 should never put
any more money into the pot and never call a bet of any size. P2 should never bet because P1
will never fold (P1 knows P2‚Äôs range is capped at 99).
 P1 won‚Äôt bet either since betting won‚Äôt make any money since P2 will always fold. However
in the real world, P2 might not realize they are always beat, so P1 can bet any size they think
might induce P2 to make a bad call. I‚Äôve seen this trick work many times in situations where a
player makes a tiny bet when they clearly have zero bluffs and then get called by a weaker player
who mucks their hand a second later and mutters ‚Äúyeah‚Ä¶ nice hand.‚Äù
 At equilibrium, position doesn‚Äôt matter in this set-up, but P1 has the option to exploitatively
always bet when IP and check or bet when OOP, depending on what P1 thinks will get P2 to put
more money in the pot.
P1‚Äôs Range is Polarized but Has More Nuts Than Air
 In the previous case where all of P1‚Äôs range is stronger than P2‚Äôs range, P1‚Äôs EV is the entire
pot. We know that when a player makes a bet, the size of each bet lays different pot odds to the
opponent, making a call profitable or unprofitable depending on the bet-size used. Since P1‚Äôs
range is much stronger than P2‚Äôs range, is there a bet-size so that P2 does not have a profitable
call and is then always forced to fold, allowing P1 to win 100% of the pot? (Table 156)
 Let‚Äôs make a simple test. The pot is 100 chips. If P1 makes a pot-size bet of 100 chips with all
hands, P2‚Äôs pot odds will be 33% while only having 10% equity with their range, so calling
would be -EV. So, the answer to our question is yes. Given P1 has more nut hands than air in
their range, if they bet big enough on the river with all hands, P2 won‚Äôt be able to call, despite
having some equity in the pot, resulting in that equity being denied.
 If P1 bets too small, giving P2 the right odds to call, P2 will indeed call and P1‚Äôs EV will be
less than the entire pot. So, P1 must bet big enough to force P2 to fold. However, betting too big
involves some risk for P1. What happens if P2 slowplayed a big hand or if our assumptions about
P2‚Äôs range were wrong and they show up with a monster hand that we didn‚Äôt expect?
 Even if there are many different large bets that would do the job for P1, we should find the
smallest possible bet-size that allows P1 to win the entire pot, achieving maximum EV with the
minimum risk. For this, we can find P1‚Äôs bet-size that will make P2 indifferent to calling and
folding when P1 bets their entire range.
Where:
Starting pot = 1
EQ is P2 equity
B is P1 bet-size
 In our example, P2‚Äôs range only wins when P1 holds 44 and that represents 0.10 of P2‚Äôs total
range. So, P2‚Äôs EQ against P1 is 10%, and P1‚Äôs minimum bet-size that allows P1 to win the full
pot is:
 The minimum bet-size that allows P1 to win the full pot is only 12.5% of the size of the pot. If
P1 bets any smaller with their entire range, then P2 will have a profitable call (Table 157).
 If P2 had more equity in the pot, P1‚Äôs minimum bet-size would get bigger, and even if P2 was
ahead of 40% of P1‚Äôs range, P1 would still be able to win the entire pot by betting 2x the pot.
 If P1 has enough chips to force P2 to fold their entire range, then the EV of P1‚Äôs bluff combos
is the same as their value hands. In this example, if P1 bets 12.5% of the pot or more, the EV of
AA is 100% of the pot and the EV of 44 is also 100% of the pot, while the EV of P2 is 0.
 If P1 has enough chips to make the minimum bet required to win the entire pot with their
entire range, P2‚Äôs equilibrium strategy is to always fold bluff-catchers no matter which bet-size
P1 uses. P1 can always obtain an EV of the full pot by betting big enough with bluffs and there is
nothing P2 can do to stop this. So, P1 could choose to use a large bet-size with all bluffs
combined with the right ratio of value combos, so that they always win the full pot with that bet-
size. With excess value hands, P1 could use any other bet-size they think P2 would call and
achieve an even larger EV than the full pot. Any time P2 decides to call against any bet-size, P1
could manipulate their range advantageously. For this reason, the only strategy that is always the
highest EV for P2 is to always fold.
 In this set-up, position is also irrelevant as P2 will never bet. P1 will bet 100% of the time and
P2 will always fold.
 When P1 does not have enough chips to make the minimum required bet-size to bet with their
entire range, they will be forced to give up with some of their bluffs. They will bet all nut hands
alongside the optimal frequency of bluffs (Alpha of their value range) to make P2 indifferent to
calling and folding, and P2 will defend 1-Alpha of the time
P1‚Äôs Range is Polarized but Has More Air Than Nuts
 Since P1‚Äôs range has more than 50% air, there is no bet they can make with their entire range
to force P2 to always fold. P1 has to give up with some of their bluffs and play the polarized vs
bluff-catcher strategy with their nut hands by betting as large as possible and then adding enough
bluffs to make P2 indifferent between calling and folding (Table 158).
 P2 has P1 beat 90% of the time, but their equilibrium strategy is still to always check. P2
cannot bet because P1‚Äôs range is polarized. P1 knows when they have the best hand and can
choose to only call when this is the case.
 When facing a bet, P2 has to call with 1-Alpha frequency to make P1‚Äôs bluffs indifferent,
otherwise P1 will incrementally increase their bluffing frequency.
 If you ever find yourself in a situation similar to P2 where you have the best hand the majority
of the time but your opponent‚Äôs range is mostly air, you are forced to play passively despite
having the best hand more often than not.
 P1 should bet as large as possible so that they can include more bluffs in their betting range.
The hands they are bluffing with will still be indifferent to bluffing and checking (if P2 calls 1-
Alpha), but the branch of the game tree where P1 gives up will happen less often.
 In our example, if P1 has a pot-size bet, they have to go all-in with a 2-to-1 value-to-bluff
ratio, so they will go all-in 15% of the time with 10% value and 5% air. Their EV will be 15% of
the pot, and P2 will win the pot 85% of the time when P1 has air and gives up. In this set-up,
position is irrelevant. Both players will play in the exact same way regardless of position.
Polarized vs Bluff Catcher with Traps
 P2‚Äôs Range is 90% Bluff-catchers and 10% Nuts
 As we have seen from the polarized vs bluff-catchers abstract models, the player with the
bluff-catcher‚Äôs range is in a disadvantageous situation and thus players should try to avoid
getting themselves in this position. One way P2 can reduce P1‚Äôs leverage is to slowplay some
nutted hands. The slowplayed nutted hands in P2‚Äôs range are traps (Table 159).
 In the polarized vs bluff-catcher model with no traps, P1‚Äôs EV increases with bet-size, but it is
capped at the size of the pot. No player‚Äôs EV can ever be greater than the pot. If P1 had a strategy
that would grant them more than the pot, then P2 could simply revert to a 100% fold strategy and
never lose further chips. Also, the lowest P1‚Äôs EV can get is 0.5 pot because they have the
winning hand 50% of the time. So even if they simply check all the time they still get at least
50% of the pot.
 Notice how at a bet-size of about 4x pot, P1 captures 90% of the pot. After that the gains
become quite marginal to the point that betting 10x pot will only win about 5% more of the pot,
95% total (Diagram 132).
 What happens when P2 has some traps in their range? Is there a cap to how big P1‚Äôs bet-size
can be?
 When 10% of P2‚Äôs range are traps, P1‚Äôs EV maxes out at SPR 1.25 (Diagram 133). After that,
their EV starts to diminish and P1 is forced to check more frequently until the SPR is so high that
they can no longer go all-in profitably, resulting in a checking strategy 100% of the time. When
P1 checks (50% of the time), they win the pot 90% of the time, so their EV is 45% of the pot.
 Going all-in for a massive overbet when your opponent can have traps is a substantial
 mistake and will lose you a lot of EV.
 With low SPRs, the threat of going all-in and occasionally running into the nuts is not as big
an issue, but when SPR gets high, it can be costly and P1 should bet smaller than all-in,
particularly if P2 can have a lot of traps.
 The problem with betting smaller than all-in is that P2 will now have the option to x/r the
river. When P2 x/r, they will be effectively turning some of their bluff-catchers into bluffs and
P1‚Äôs value-bets will now turn into bluff-catchers! This situation is particularly bad for P1 as in
the whole branch of the game tree where they get x/r, P2 will be perfectly polarized against P1,
and P2 can increase their EV by x/r bigger. The deeper the stacks, the bigger P2‚Äôs raise size can
be and the more EV will be captured.
 There is a trade off between going all-in and using a non-all-in bet-size. To find the exact bet-
size B that maximizes P1‚Äôs EV (which may or may not be all-in), we will borrow the next
formula from Will Tipton‚Äôs Book Expert Heads-up No-Limit Hold‚Äôem.
 (The calculation of this formula requires the use of Calculus and we won‚Äôt be showing the
proof in this text.)
Where:
S = Stack size
B = Bet-size
T = traps %
 When P2 can have traps in their range, P1‚Äôs bet-size actually decreases and the more traps P2
can have, the smaller P1‚Äôs bet-size becomes to the point where this bet-size approaches 0 and
they can no longer bet. At that point, P1 is forced to check their entire range.
 In this set-up, position is irrelevant for the small portion of traps in P2‚Äôs range. P2 will never
lead and P1 will always bet nut hands alongside enough air while giving up with the rest of the
air. However, if P2 has too many traps, the nature of the game changes and position becomes
relevant.
 When stacks are deep enough such that if P2 arrives to the river with too many traps, P1 will
start to check back 100% of the time. P2 will miss value from their traps because they will never
have the opportunity to win any extra bets. At that point, P2 will be incentivized to start leading
some traps which will make P1 bet more often when checked to, and this trade off will
eventually reach an equilibrium point where the EV of leading some traps will be the same as the
EV of checking them. P2 will then play a mixed strategy, slowplaying just enough nuts to protect
their checking range.
 In general x/r is not a great way to deny your opponent‚Äôs equity and it is not a great way
 to get value. What it actually achieves is preventing opponents from value-betting thin and
 from bluffing a lot when you check to them. Just having 10-20% traps in your range is
 enough to accomplish both at most stack depths.
 In this set-up, P2 will still defend at the MDF and their calling frequency will be:

### TOPIC: Linear Distributions
So far we have focused our discussion of river abstract models where we are able to partition the
players‚Äô ranges into disconnected categories of hands that were clearly identifiable as nuts, air,
bluff-catchers and traps. However, in many real poker situations, both players‚Äô ranges will
contain a mixture of hands made up from all of these categories.
 Since the players‚Äô range distributions won‚Äôt necessarily divide into non-overlapping
categories, we need to create a system to categorize these linear distributions.
 Categorizing all hands according to their equity with 1 being the strongest hand and 0 the
weakest, we can split the ranges into three main sections. These will be with value hands at the
top, checking hands in the middle and bluffing hands at the bottom, effectively betting a
polarized distribution. If the player is OOP, they will be checking some value hands as traps, so
the checking range is not 100% bluff-catchers.
 The bottom value hand as well as the best bluff will be indifferent to betting and checking.
The player will bet all value hands above the bottom value hand and will bluff all hands that are
below the strongest bluff.
 The checking range consists of everything in the middle and, for all of those hands, the EV of
checking will be higher than the EV of betting.
 The player facing a bet will split their range into two main categories, defending hands and
folding hands. If the bet-size faced is all-in, the defending player needs to find the threshold hand
that is indifferent to calling and folding and call all hands better than that threshold. If the bet-
size is not all-in, the defending player will raise all their traps alongside an appropriate number of
bluffs.
 The key to river play when players have linear distributions consists of correctly identifying
these threshold hands. In the very simple example where the players‚Äô ranges are symmetric, OOP
can only bet or check, and their checking hands have zero equity. If OOP bets, IP can call or
fold.
 The next equations explain the very simple example where all the checking hands have 0%
equity and players can only bet, check and call, but not raise.
Where:
b = bet size
p = pot size
hc = defending player threshold calling hand
hb = betting player threshold betting hand
EQhc = equity of the threshold calling hand
 In this example, the betting player will bet all hands that are better than hb and simply give up
with the rest. The defending player will call all hands that are better than hc and fold the rest.
Example
Assume the players are going all-in for a pot sized bet with
b=p=s
s = stack size
 The threshold calling hand for the defending player will be:
 Given the ranges are symmetric, then
 and the threshold betting hand for the betting player is:
 In this case, the betting player‚Äôs threshold is 1/4, which means they are betting all better hands,
so 3/4 of all hands. Since the defending player is getting 2-to-1 pot odds, 2/3 of the betting hands
beat hc and the other 1/3 of hands, which lose to hc, are pure bluffs since they never win when
called.
 For more complex situations where the checking hands have equity and players can raise, the
equations are far more complex, and calculating the threshold hands by hand is not possible in
most cases. For this reason, the best approach to study river abstract models with linear
distributions is to replicate them in a GTO solver. In the next section, we will go over a couple of
these examples, but I encourage the reader to test these and other situations in order to get
proficient with the general strategies.
Symmetric Range
 We already studied this type of linear distribution (Table 163) in the [0-1] Single Street Toy
Game section, but it had the constraint of OOP always checking to IP. This time, we will study
equilibrium play when OOP is allowed to bet the river.
 With SPR of 1 or more, OOP will check middle strength hands TT-66 alongside most AA-KK
for protection. They will bet with QQ-JJ plus the rest of their AA and KK as well as 55 as a
bluff, using a 1/3-pot bet-size.
 With SPR 1 or less, OOP‚Äôs strategy is to go all-in with most of the top of their range JJ+,
while checking about 10-20% of them to protect the checking range and to bluff with 55. As the
SPR gets shallower, OOP‚Äôs value range expands from JJ+ at 0.75 SPR to 99+ at 0.25 SPR (Table
164).
 With SPR 5+, IP never goes all-in after OOP checks. Their strategy consists of splitting their
range between pot and half-pot bet-sizes, betting pot with most AA ‚Äì KK, while also using some
in the smaller size to protect against being x/r, while checking back their middle strength hands
TT-77. QQ-JJ are bet using the half-pot bet-size. 55 and some 66 are used as bluffs in both bet-
sizes (Table 165).
 With SPR 2, IP will go all-in with most of their AA-KK, using the smaller size for QQ and
some JJ, bluffing 66-55 and checking back TT-77. With SPR 1 and under, IP will check back all
middle strength hands TT-77, go all-in with a polar range of JJ+ and 55-66, expanding their
value range as SPRs gets smaller to include 88+ with SPR 0.25.
Ranges Overlap in the Middle
In this situation, some hands in P1‚Äôs range are stronger than all of P2‚Äôs range and some hands in
P2‚Äôs range are weaker than all of P1‚Äôs Range (Table 166).
P1 is IP and P2 is OOP
When P2 is OOP, they will never bet unless the SPR is very small.
 After P2 checks, P1 will have two different bet-sizes when SPR is 2+, all-in and 125%-pot.
The all-in bet-size will be used with the nut hands P2 cannot have (AA-KK), and the 125%-pot
bet-size will be used with the value range that overlaps with P2‚Äôs range (QQ). 55-66 plus some
77 will be used as bluffs and the middle strength hands (JJ-77) are checked back.
 With SPR 1 and below, P1 will check back middle strength hands (TT-77) and will go all-in
with a polarized range of AA-JJ for value and 55-66 as bluffs (Table 167).
P1 is OOP and P2 is IP
 With SPR 2 or more, P1 likes to develop two different bet-sizes, all-in, which will be used
with the nut hands P2 cannot have in their range (AA-KK), and a smaller 25%-pot bet-size with
the top of their range that overlaps with P2‚Äôs range (QQ-TT). 66-55 are used as bluffs and 99-77
are checked alongside a very small fraction of AA-KK and most of QQ to protect P1‚Äôs checking
range (Table 168).
 With SPR 1 and below, P1 will also develop the use of two different bet-sizes, all-in and a
smaller 10%-pot size. The all-in bet-size will be used with a polarized range of JJ+ and 66-55,
and the smaller bet-size will be used with TT-99, a sliver of AA-JJ and some 66 as bluffs. The
checking range will be 88-77 plus a small frequency of TT+ for protection. As the SPR gets
shallower, P1 gets to jam more hands and starts to move TT-99 into the all-in range (Table 169).
 After P1 checks, P2 will be checking back middle strength hands (99-66) and will bet a
polarized range with QQ-TT for value and bluff some frequency of their weakest hands (55-33).
When stacks are very deep, P2 cannot use a large bet-size because they risk getting x/r, but as
stacks get shallower, P2 can increase their bet-size to 75%-pot, and with an SPR of 1 and less, P2
will simply go all-in with their betting range (Table 170).
Blocker Effects
For this section, we will modify the board and ranges as follows:
Board: 8‚ô•3‚ô•3‚ô£2‚ô•2
Pot: 100 chips
Effective Stack: 500 chips
Betting Structure: Villain always checks to Hero, Hero can bet 25, 50, 100 or all-in. If Hero
uses a non all-in bet-size, Villain can x/r all-in.
Blocker Example 1
Hero is IP with a range of:
 9 combos of nut flush: A‚ô•K‚ô•-A‚ô•9‚ô•, A‚ô•7‚ô•-A‚ô•4‚ô•
 12 combos of nut blocker: A‚ô•Kx, A‚ô•Qx, A‚ô•Jx, A‚ô•Tx
 24 combos of lower flush blocker: K‚ô•Qx, Q‚ô•Jx, J‚ô•Tx, T‚ô•9x, 9‚ô•8x, 7‚ô•6x, 6x5x, 5‚ô•4
 6 combos of non-flush blockers: 7‚ô†6‚ô†, 7‚ô†5‚ô†, 7‚ô†4‚ô†, 6‚ô†5‚ô†, 6‚ô†4‚ô†, 5‚ô†4‚ô†
 Villain is OOP with a range of 45 flush combos that aren‚Äôt blocked by the board:
 9 combos of nut flush: A‚ô•K‚ô•-A‚ô•9‚ô•, A‚ô•7‚ô•-A‚ô•4‚ô•
 8 combos of K-high flush: K‚ô•Q‚ô•-K‚ô•9‚ô•, K‚ô•7‚ô•-K‚ô•4‚ô•
 7 combos of Q-high flush: Q‚ô•J‚ô•-Q‚ô•9‚ô•, Q‚ô•7‚ô•-Q‚ô•4‚ô•
 6 combos of J-high flush: J‚ô•T‚ô•-J‚ô•9‚ô•, J‚ô•7‚ô•-J‚ô•4‚ô•
 5 combos of T-high flush: T‚ô•9‚ô•, T‚ô•7‚ô•-T‚ô•4‚ô•
 4 combos of 9-high flush: 9‚ô•7‚ô•-9‚ô•4‚ô•
 3 combos of 7-high flush: 7‚ô•6‚ô•-7‚ô•4‚ô•
 2 combos of 6-high flush: 6‚ô•5‚ô•, 6‚ô•4‚ô•
 1 combo of 5-high flush: 5‚ô•4‚ô•
 In this set-up, the Villain will never bet, even though all of their hands are flushes, because
Hero‚Äôs range is polarized. Hero either has the nuts or a bluff. Clearly Hero has many more bluffs
than value combos so, at equilibrium, cannot bet them all. In this case, what type of hands would
make the best bluffing combos for Hero, and what would be the optimal bet-size?
 This situation is similar to the polarized vs bluff catchers with traps abstract model but in this
situation, if Hero has the nuts or the nut blocker, then the Villain‚Äôs range contains zero traps. For
this reason, the best bluffing combos for Hero are the nut flush blocker. By betting only with the
nut flush and the nut blocker, Hero is effectively turning the game into the polarized vs bluff
catchers toy game and, as we know, Hero will maximize EV by going all-in with all value
combos and just enough bluffs to make the Villain indifferent to calling and folding. In fact,
bluffing with non-nut blockers will lose Hero EV. The Villain has to defend 1-Alpha of their
range to make Hero‚Äôs bluffs indifferent to betting and checking.
 In this situation, the GTO solver might show a higher calling frequency than expected for the
Villain. This occurs because the solver accounts for the calls with the ‚Äúghost‚Äù nut flushes that the
Villain never really has. Ignoring the 9 nut flush combos, the Villain‚Äôs calling frequency will be
exactly 1-Alpha. Some GTO solvers have the option to display real frequencies.
Blocker Example 2
Hero is IP with a range of:
 9 combos of nut flush: A‚ô•K‚ô•-A‚ô•9‚ô•, A‚ô•7‚ô•-A‚ô•4‚ô•
 24 combos of lower flush blocker: K‚ô•Qx, Q‚ô•Jx, J‚ô•Tx, T‚ô•9x, 9‚ô•8x, 7‚ô•6x, 6x5x, 5‚ô•4x.
 6 combos of non-flush blockers: 7‚ô†6‚ô†, 7‚ô†5‚ô†, 7‚ô†4‚ô†, 6‚ô†5‚ô†, 6‚ô†4‚ô†, 5‚ô†4‚ô†
 Villain is OOP with a range of 45 flush combos that aren‚Äôt blocked by the board:
 9 combos of nut flush: A‚ô•K‚ô•-A‚ô•9‚ô•, A‚ô•7‚ô•-A‚ô•4‚ô•
 8 combos of K-high flush: K‚ô•Q‚ô•-K‚ô•9‚ô•, K‚ô•7‚ô•-K‚ô•4‚ô•
 7 combos of Q-high flush: Q‚ô•J‚ô•-Q‚ô•9‚ô•, Q‚ô•7‚ô•-Q‚ô•4‚ô•
 6 combos of J-high flush: J‚ô•T‚ô•-J‚ô•9‚ô•, J‚ô•7‚ô•-J‚ô•4‚ô•
 5 combos of T-high flush: T‚ô•9‚ô•, T‚ô•7‚ô•-T‚ô•4‚ô•
 4 combos of 9-high flush: 9‚ô•7‚ô•-9‚ô•4‚ô•
 3 combos of 7-high flush: 7‚ô•6‚ô•-7‚ô•4‚ô•
 2 combos of 6-high flush: 6‚ô•5‚ô•, 6‚ô•4‚ô•
 1 combo of 5-high flush: 5‚ô•4‚ô•
 In this set-up, we removed the nut blockers from Hero‚Äôs range. Just as before, the Villain will
never lead into Hero. Now that Hero does not have the nut blocker, what should their strategy
be? Should they still go all-in or should they use a smaller bet-size than previously?
 Now that Hero does not have the nut blocker, they can no longer remove the traps from the
Villain‚Äôs range. Going all-in for a large overbet without the nut blocker will lose Hero a lot of
EV so, in this case, Hero will be betting the size of the pot.
 Which combos are now best to use as bluffs? When I ask this question to my students, many
rush to say that now that the nut blocker is missing, Hero should be using the second nut blocker
(K‚ô•) combos. However, in reality, no blocker is better than a non-nut blocker. The solver prefers
to bluff with the low spade combos instead. The reason for this is because if Hero chooses to
bluff a given flush blocker, say the K‚ô• combos, the solver could adjust to start overfolding the
king-high flushes and calling with more of the lower flush combos.
 If we add a few nut blocker combos to Hero‚Äôs range, but not enough to go all-in with their
entire value range, Hero will split their value range into two sections, going all-in with as many
nut combos as can be accommodated plus the nut blockers, and betting full pot with the rest of
the value range, using the low spade combos as bluffs.
 For SPR 1 and lower, Hero‚Äôs bet-size will always be all-in if they have enough nut blocker
combos. Hero should go all-in with enough blockers to make the Villain indifferent, and give up
the rest. If there are not enough nut blockers in Hero‚Äôs range, they can complete their bluffing
frequency with low spade combos. If Hero has more flushes in their range other than the nut
flush, then flush blockers become more valuable and are higher EV bluffs than non-flush
blockers.

### TOPIC: Practical Applications
This section is a quick summary of the most important river characteristics and how to apply
them in-game.
OOP River Betting
Range composition that favors a high x/r frequency vs OOP bet
 OOP has a lot of hands that want to realize equity. Having many traps reduces IP‚Äôs overall
 betting frequency and helps OOP realize equity.
 OOP has a small number of strong hands but they are nutted.
 IP has a range structure that makes them want to bet at a high frequency after a check.
 x/r protects OOP from IP‚Äôs thin value-bets.
 On dry boards after x/c x/c, OOP will usually not have much pure air and will often use
 hands like bottom pair that are typically x/f as x/r bluffs.
Why bet from OOP
 Fundamental difference in position is that IP‚Äôs checks realize their equity. Betting from
 OOP prevents IP from realizing equity for free.
 Range compositions determine how much the opponent wants to bet and check.
 Generally, you want to bet when IP wants to check back often.
OOP bets rivers after IP checks back the turn
 On average, IP‚Äôs range after checking back the turn will be more condensed and OOP‚Äôs
 range will be more polarized.
 OOP should bet the river at a reasonable frequency, approximately 20-30% of the time.
 If IP checks back on a high betting frequency turn, that makes their range getting to the
 river a lot weaker, while if they check back a relatively bad turn, the check back range
 will be stronger.
OOP leads river after x/c, x/c
 On average, after IP bets twice, their range will be very polarized and OOP‚Äôs range will
 be more condensed. Most of OOP‚Äôs hands after x/c, x/c want a cheap showdown.
 After x/c, x/c, the situations where OOP wants to donk bet the river are somewhat rare.
 They usually occur when the river card, or often the turn and river card together,
 significantly shift the polarization of the ranges. When this happens, OOP will
 unexpectedly have many strong hands and IP will tend to want to check back the river at
 a high frequency. Donk bet frequency can be 75%+ in these cases.
 While the cases requiring river donk bets are rare, the EV impact is usually high enough
 to be worth studying. Some examples are four-flush and four-straight boards, when the
 river pairs the second highest card on the board, and runner-runner pair.
IP River Betting
Betting from IP is much simpler than betting from OOP. After OOP has checked, their range will
generally be weak and mostly made of bluff-catchers. If your range is polarized, bet as big as
you can and add enough bluffs to make OOP indifferent to calling and folding. If your range is
condensed, check back your middle strength hands, bet the top of your range and use the weakest
hands as bluffs.
 If your range is not very nutted, you can still value-bet, but choose a small bet-size,
particularly if OOP can be trapping. If your range is too weak or OOP can have too many traps,
checking back and taking a free showdown is usually good. Don‚Äôt forget to always add a small
frequency of your nutted hands to your small bet-size so you are protected against x/r, although
this is unnecessary if OOP has no traps.
IP Play vs River Bets
The best exploit vs players who don‚Äôt bet the river often enough is to value-bet less thinly and to
fold the river more often when they bet. If you know OOP won‚Äôt be betting the river too often,
you can get away with c-betting the flop a lot more. This is because your EV when you called is
higher, as you get a lot of free showdowns and get to realize the equity of many marginal hands
that you wouldn‚Äôt normally be able to.
 Conversely, the best exploit vs players who frequently bet the river after turn checks is to not
c-bet the flop too often, so you don‚Äôt end up with as much air that has to check back the turn and
then fold to a river lead. From IP, it is important that you check back the turn with some hands
that are capable of raising river bets, otherwise OOP can get away with a lot of betting if IP‚Äôs
range contains too much air/bluff catchers.
River Calling Strategies
Blockers
 On the river, all bluff-catchers are equal except in how they block value hands and don‚Äôt
 block bluffs.
 When you block the opponent‚Äôs value range, call more often.
 When you block the opponent‚Äôs bluffing range, fold more often.
 When you block the opponent‚Äôs value and bluffing range, look for other decision points.
 When you have no blockers, it is irrelevant, or slightly negative.
River Call Decision Points
 Use their value range as a starting point. Even against very tight players, always call
 hands in their value range.
 Never call with bluff-catchers if the Villain doesn‚Äôt have enough bluffs.
 If there is a lot of air in the Villain‚Äôs range, they will be more likely to be bluffing.
 Perception matters. If we are perceived to be a calling station, assume an expanded value
 range. If we are perceived as weak, expect a narrow value range (and wider bluffing
 range).
 Defending close to 1-Alpha is a good approximation in most river spots.
 You can use the knowledge of the river set-ups to improve your pre-flop, flop, and turn play.
If you know beforehand what the best possible river scenarios are for you, then all your earlier
street play should focus on arriving to those beneficial river situations. At the same time this
maximizes the likelihood of you getting there more often with the correct range composition.
 Your opponents will be doing the same and this is exactly how GTO solvers work out the
equilibrium strategies on earlier streets. They work out turn strategies that lead to the optimal
river situations, then they also work out the flop strategies that lead to those turn situations. They
then repeat this for pre-flop play. All of this is done with the single goal of maximizing each
player‚Äôs EV by creating the most profitable situation possible that leads to the most profitable
future situations. This happens until equilibrium is reached and both players are playing GTO.
Failing to do so at any point during a hand creates imbalances that will inevitably lead to
unfavorable situations that your opponents can exploit, and that is what exploitative play is all
about.
