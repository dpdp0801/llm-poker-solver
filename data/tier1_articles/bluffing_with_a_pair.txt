### TOPIC: bluffing with a pair
Should You Ever Bluff with a Pair?
Turning a made hand into a bluff might initially sound counterintuitive. In the pre-solver days, holding a weak pair was often associated with checking, “We don’t want to bloat the pot and are happy to reach a cheap showdown” was a common saying. Solvers helped us understand that betting weak pairs outperforms checking in some situations. The line between randomly betting pairs and precisely knowing what you are doing can be blurry. But fear not! In this article, you will learn everything you need to successfully grasp the concepts of bluffing pairs in cash games to outplay your opponents.

The Logic Behind Turning Pairs → Bluffs
Before diving into the practical examples, we need to know a few theoretical things.
When we look at solver outputs on the river, we frequently see that we are not just bluffing our air but are also supposed to use some of our pairs. The solver calculates:
The EV of pure bluffing: EV (Bluff) = (Fold% × (Pot)) – (Defend% × (Bet))
The EV of checking as the IP player: (EQ of hand) × (Pot)
(OOP is slightly more complicated because we are not closing the action.)
The calculated EV helps us to understand how all of the possible actions perform on the river.
On earlier streets, however, multiple merged motives can sometimes encourage us to take the aggressive line with some of our weak pairs.
To clarify, a solver does not “think” as a human would; it’s an EV-maximizing algorithm that calculates the best strategies given the inputs that were provided. By comparing solver outputs, we can recognize repeating patterns for which we can build heurístics that make all of this output easier to understand and more practical to use in-game.

The Dos and Don’ts
Turning pairs into a bluff can be tricky. Often, minor differences draw the line between an excellent play and a spew. But there is good news! This is not just solver noise. Every strange-looking play is made for a reason. The more we understand how ranges interact with board textures and potential runouts, the easier it becomes. To uncover the different motives for sometimes taking the aggressive route with our weak pairs and acquire the ability to spot the difference between randomly clicking buttons and thoughtful plays, we will inspect some realistic examples to better grasp when and why to turn pairs into bluffs.
Bluffing Pairs in Single-Raised Pots
We usually want to keep the pot small with marginal holdings, especially when we are out of position (OOP). There are situations, though, where we want to check/raise some of our weak pairs. To give you a better insight, let us explore the following spot:
BB response (filtered for suited 4-x) vs BTN’s 33% pot c-bet on K84r: NL500, 100bb starting
As we can see, our bottom pairs, especially the ones with the lowest kickers, get checked/raised around 20% of the time here. But why is that? Let’s take a closer look at the BTN response to find out:
BTN response vs BB’s 100% pot check/raise
There are a couple of prominent indicators to be identified in the BTN’s response:
The BTN is starting to fold better pairs, such as 55–77, some 8-x, and even a tiny percentage of their weakest top pairs. IP is folding a massive number of two live overcards to the four, which results in an immense amount of EQ denial. At the same time, the BTN is floating with their best backdoor hands. So, the effect is of a merged nature; we get some better hands to fold and a few worse hands to call (or fold).
The BB blocks a decent amount of IP’s best hands when holding a four while having five outs to outdraw their higher pairs.
IP is folding a lot of Ten-x, Jack-x, and Queen-x, so OOP prefers to check/raise 4-x that unblock those hands by not holding one of these three cards. Hands like Q4 block more of IP’s folding range than hands like 43. Another motive is the risk of coolers for OOP increases when holding Q4 instead of 43. IP has significantly more KQ and QQ combos they continue with compared to 33 and K3 because IP doesn’t have any K3o in his range and folds all 33 combos versus the check/raise.
In this situation, one exception is low pairs with an overcard to the top pair, A4. A4 benefits from check/raising since it can outdraw current nutted two pairs and cooler Ace-x when an Ace turns up.
Getting a clearer picture of how to play the flop is already great, but future streets are often still shrouded in a fog of war. Countless different runouts can make it feel complicated to locate the signal of when and why to keep betting our weak pairs. Let us examine how and how not to keep betting our weakest pairs on future runouts together.

When To Keep Bluffing With Pairs
We take a turn onto a bricky 2. The sim tells us to keep the pressure on with almost 80% of BB’s 4-x. Some motives are pretty similar to the flop, but a few differ.
The first two reasons overlap with the ones on the flop: The BTN folds many better pairs:
All pocket pairs below the King fold purely.
The vast majority of second pairs (68.4%), and even a considerable number of top pairs (34.9%). (BB also denies a significant amount of EQ from all BTN’s flop floats that are now pure folding on the turn.)
The noticeable difference is that the BB is running out of bluffs. All the BDSD and BDFD combos between the 8 and the King are giving up pure because of poor blocker properties and no chance to improve to even outdraw a top pair King. The BB’s 4-x combos are getting forced into becoming bluffs. The fact that the BTN doesn’t continue with worse hands, except for a minimal amount of gutshots around the low end of the board, is also an indication that they’re now considered bluffs. Third pair (4-x) is now betting for less merged motives; they become almost pure polar bluffs.
The river doesn’t change much on almost all runouts, except for the worst ones (King and 8); the BB is turning a substantial amount of 4-x into bluffs.
BB first-in river strategy (filter: 4-x) vs BTN on K842r 2 (after flop = X-B33-R100-C, turn = B125-C)
While the BB’s reasons for check/raising some of their small pairs started out merged on the flop, the motives cleared up as the hand progressed through the streets to the river. Blocking a substantial amount of BTN´s strong hands and running out of natural bluffs while at the bottom of their range are the leading drivers for the BB to complete the conversion of 4-x into a bluff on the river in this spot.

When To Stop Bluffing With Pairs
In some scenarios, we don’t want to follow through with our weak pairs. To gain a more detailed understanding, let’s explore the following spot.
BB first-in river strategy (filter: 4-x) vs BTN on K8422 double FD brick (after flop = X-B33-R100-C, turn = B125-C)
Did you notice a difference regarding the board texture from the prior spot? At first, it seems there is only a small one, right? The suits changed, but that´s about it. The strategy for OOP’s 4-x massively differs, though.
All of BB’s 4-x is now pure checking the river. Let us find out why!
We see something worth noticing if we examine the EQ of BB’s 4-x on the river. They have roughly twice the amount of EQ compared to the spot before. The reason is pretty simple: The BTN has lots of bricked flush draws. So, the BB can beat some of villain’s range at showdown with all their 4-x. OOP collects enough EV (i.e., showdown value) to make check the max EV action.
The BTN has a lot of bricked flush draws, but so does the BB, right? In the spot prior, the BB was running out of natural bluffs and was at the bottom of range when holding a single pair of fours. The BB can now choose bluffs from all their bricked flush draws they check/raised and barreled turn with.
To summarize the key learning so far:
There are sometimes merged motives for betting low pairs on the flop and turn, despite having enough showdown value and other bluffs to choose from.
The main merged motives for low pairs are:
Folding out better hands (pairs).
Denying EQ while getting called by worse hands (draws).
Those merge-bets with low pairs happen even more frequently when in position because the IP player can realize more EQ by always being able to check back the river on runouts where they don’t need to turn their weak pairs into a bluff.
As we can see, minor differences in board texture can cause major differences in strategy. Keeping an eye on how ranges look across all streets will help you maneuver through these spots more efficiently.

Bluffing Pairs in 3-Bet Pots
Turning pairs into a bluff is not just happening in SRPs. Let us explore the following two spots together to help you understand when and when not to bluff pairs in 3-bet pots!
When To Bluff With Pairs
BTN river strategy vs CO on AK48T (with flop = X-B33-C, turn = X-B75-C): NL500, 100bb starting)
When we examine the river output more closely, we will instantly notice that the BTN is bluffing with a decent amount of third and worse pairs (roughly 62%). There are a few reasons:
BTN’s lowest pairs have almost no showdown value.
Hands such as JT and QT have good removal effects since they don’t block any snap-folds and also block rivered two pairs the CO is pure calling the river with. Even though they win more at showdown compared to the lowest pocket pairs, it’s only by a marginal amount—they only have 5–7% EQ themselves.
IP is running out of natural bluffs. Hands such as QJ/QT and JT that were gutshots on the turn rivered a straight or a pair. There are only very few busted draws in the BTN’s range. In particular, the lowest pairs with pure unblocker properties are now forced to turn themselves into a bluff. When we modify the river to a brick (that doesn’t change the nuts) like a deuce, we see that most of the BTN’s low pairs are checking back.
Ranges become very tight on the river. Blocker effects matter way more now. Having removal of a couple of strong hands in villain’s range already or blocking some of the snap-folds already has an enormous impact on their calling/folding ranges. A hand such as Q♦9♦ gives up pure while QT is bluffing pure, even though Q9 has less showdown value (roughly 5% less EQ). Q9 in diamonds blocks several snap-folds while JT has removal to a bunch of strong hands.
Notice that the same reasons to bluff low pairs return:
The low pairs are weak, they have low showdown value.
Favorable blocker effects.
The player runs out of natural bluffs.
Before we explore when not to bluff pairs in 3-bet pots, let’s test our understanding of ranges and how this impacts our strategy!
The EV of all given options to the BTN for JTs on the river
Question: J♠T♠ makes more money than J♥T♥ and even more than double the amount of J♦T♦ for the shoving option. Why is that?
Reveal Answer
You can use this knowledge to your advantage. In spots where you suspect that your opponent will call slightly lighter than he is supposed to, we can simplify and purely give up with our worst-performing pairs that are indifferent at equilibrium.
When you struggle with finding the motives why a particular combo gets chosen over another for a particular action, a closer look at the following two things will help you.
Exploring the trash and value removal scores at the top left of each combo.
Examine your opponent’s response versus your strategy.

When Not To Bluff With Pairs
BTN river strategy vs CO on JT523 (with flop = X-B33-C, turn = X-B75-C): NL500, 100bb starting)
When we compare the previous spot with this one, we will spot a big difference regarding the bluffing combos: The BTN is not bluffing with a single pair on the river, but why?
Even the worst pairs, such as A3s have almost 16% EQ, way more than the worst pairs in the spot before. The CO has a lot of bricked draws in range, enough that even the worst pairs in CO’s range win more than 15% of the time.
The BTN is not running out of natural bluffs. IP has plenty of combos with acceptable or good blocker properties, such as all busted straight draws and Ace-highs, except those with spades. All of them have much worse showdown value compared to the low pairs.
In spots where a player has lots of natural bluffs with good blocker properties and very little showdown value to choose from on the river, they often won’t need to turn weak pairs into a bluff.
The Influence of Position
Positions play a prominent role in how you construct your strategy. Let’s jump into the following spot to understand more deeply what influence positions have on bluffing pairs.
↑ BTN river strategy (filter: low pair) vs BB on JT36A flush-completing in an SRP (with flop = X-B50-C, turn = X-X)
———
↓ UTG river strategy (filter: low pair) vs BB (same board (runout) and action)
Both spots are very similar, with the same flop sizing and turn check, on the same board. The only visible difference is the position. The IP player in the left picture opened from UTG, and the IP player on the right opened from the BTN. When we note the worst pairs of the IP player, we notice that the BTN checks them 100% of the time, while the UTG player turns them into a bluff almost 40% of the time. There are the following reasons:
The BB’s postflop defense is much wider versus the BTN compared to the one versus UTG. This means the lowest pairs of the BTN have way more EQ and showdown value compared to UTG. Looking at the EQ of the weakest pairs in both outputs confirms that. All pocket 99 and lower pairs of UTG have 0% EQ, while those same hands of BTN retain between 8–25% EQ.
The postflop defending ranges differ greatly depending on the position, but so do the preflop opening ranges. While the UTG player lacks a lot of natural bluffs in his range, such as all the seven to King-high combos, the BTN has far more natural bluffs to choose from.
As we can see, position is a very influential factor in the process of answering the questions of when and why to bluff pairs. In the end, though, it all comes down to how well you understand the composition of ranges and their interaction with board textures. Constantly improving this skill will help you to outperform and outplay your opponents in the long run.
When We Want to Deviate
Against weaker opponents who deviate themselves (often unintentionally), we want to adjust our strategy as well—from the default, GTO game plan to a custom-tailored, exploitative one. To illustrate how to adapt when it comes to turning pairs into bluffs, let us do a little experiment and take the previous BB vs BTN spot on JT36A flush-completing river but with a little twist.
In theory, the BB can only fold slightly over 50% of their third and worse pairs against a 67% pot river-bet in this spot.
Now, let us imagine we play at our local casino and face a tighter player who folds all their third pairs and worse on the river. How do we want to adjust?
↑ BTN GTO river strategy (filter: low pair) vs BB on JT36A flush-completing river in an SRP (with flop = X-B50-C, turn = X-X): equilibrium
———
↓ BTN exploitative river strategy (filter: low pair) vs BB (same board (runout), same action): nodelocked BB response (folding 100% of all third pairs and worse)
When we look at our default (GTO) strategy, we see that all low pairs always check on the river. They have enough showdown value, and the BTN has so much air to choose from that we don’t even consider bluffing them. They are “too high up in our range.”
Even though the above reasons also apply, when we examine the nodelocked (exploitative) solution, we notice a massive difference. The BTN is turning 100% of their low pairs into bluffs. Comparing the EV of BTN’s low pairs shows us how drastic the impact of BB’s heavy over-folding is:
The EV of all given options to the BTN for 55 on the river: GTO (↖), Exploitative (↗)
Depending on the combo, the EV of bluffing for all low pairs increases between 250 and even over 400%. An outcome like this is not even unrealistic when we face a very tight player. As we can see, turning pairs into a bluff that would usually always take a showdown can be highly profitable. Keeping an eye on the player type you are facing, understanding what you and your opponent are supposed to do, and being able to adjust accordingly will skyrocket your win rate.

Conclusion
Uff, this was a lot of information to process! Let us go over the most critical points again.
While the motive for betting low pairs on the river is primarily driven by folding out better ones, betting low pairs on earlier streets often involves merged motives. The main reasons are to fold out better made hands and deny EQ while getting called by worse hands (typically draws). Merged betting with low pairs happens more often when we are IP due to higher EQR.
In river spots where we have many natural bluffs with good blocker properties and very little showdown value to choose from, turning our low pairs into a bluff is often overkill.
Don’t gloss over seemingly small differences in board texture. They can significantly impact optimal strategies.
When you are not sure why a particular combo gets chosen over another, inspect the trash and value removal scores at the top-left of each hand combination and how your opponent will respond versus your strategy. It will help you to maneuver through the hands more confidently.
Understanding the composition of ranges and their interaction with board textures is the key to outplaying your opponents in the long run.
Adapting to the mistakes of our opposing players will make the difference between being a slight or massive winner.
