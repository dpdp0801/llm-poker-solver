### TOPIC: 3bet strategy
If you have watched a single episode of a poker TV show or an hour of a poker livestream, you have surely heard the term 3-bet at least once, as it has become one of the most widely used poker terms.
While technically speaking, 3-bet literally means a re-raise, the term is used as it better describes the particular type of a re-raise in question, as we will explain in further text.
If you are already familiar with 3-betting in poker, you can skip the next section, which will explain what a 3-bet in poker is, and move on to the following sections. In those, we are going to discuss the main reasons for 3-betting, the ways in which you should select your 3-betting hands, and the general 3-betting strategy to apply.
But before all that, for those who don’t know, let’s explain what a 3-bet is in the first place.
A 3-bet is the first re-raise in a betting round, commonly occurring preflop in No-Limit Texas Hold’em. It’s a powerful tool that can be used both for value and as a bluff.Key Concepts:* Value 3-Betting: Re-raising with strong hands (e.g., AA, KK, QQ, AK) to build the pot and extract value from weaker hands.* Bluff 3-Betting: Re-raising with hands that are not strong but have potential (e.g., suited connectors, suited aces) to exploit opponents who fold too often to 3-bets.* Balancing Your Range: To avoid being predictable, mix value and bluff 3-bets. This balance makes it harder for opponents to read your hand strength.* Merged vs. Polarized Ranges: Merged Range includes strong hands and hands with good playability; used against opponents who call frequently. Polarized Range includes premium hands and bluffs; used against opponents who fold often to 3-bets.Sizing Your 3-Bets:* In Position: 3x to 3.5x the original raise.* Out of Position: 4x to 4.5x the original raise.By effectively incorporating 3-bets into your strategy, you can apply pressure on opponents, isolate weaker players, play more heads-up pots, extract more value from strong hands, and increase your overall profitability.
The term 3-bet in poker stands for the first re-raise made on any particular betting street, although it is most commonly used during the preflop betting round.
While the term 2-bet is very rarely used in poker, a 2-bet would be applicable to the first preflop raise, as the big blind always stands as the initial bet. A 3-bet, then, stands for the next raise made before the flop, or rather the second raise made on all consecutive betting streets.
For instance, in a $1/2 cash game, a player opening to $5 would be 2-betting, while a player re-raising that raise to $15 would be making a 3-bet.
On the flop, a bet of $10 is made. One player raises to $30, and this raise represents a 2-bet. Then, another player bumps it up to $100, making a 3-bet.
So, as you can see, the concept of a 3-bet has nothing to do with the size of the raise or bet but rather simply with the particular situation of making the second overall raise on a given betting street.
3-betting is an essential part of no-limit Texas Hold’em.
So now that we have discussed what a 3-bet is and how it is made, it’s time to consider the two main reasons to make a 3-bet in the first place.
The two main reasons to 3-bet are:
Let’s take a look at both of these reasons with some simple examples and explanations of why a 3-bet is warranted in both cases.
The first and simplest reason to 3-bet in any given spot is for value. When we believe our hand is very strong, making another raise makes sense, as we want to build the pot and get as much money into the middle as possible.
For instance, imagine holding two black Aces before the flop in a $0.25/0.50 cash game online in the small blind. The cutoff raises to $1.25, and the action is on you. In all cases, you will want to 3-bet this hand, as getting more money into the pot with Aces is always a good idea.
At this point, the only decision you have is how much to raise, and this decision can be impacted by several factors, including your and the raiser’s position, stack sizes, player profiles, etc.
Similarly, holding TsTd on a flop of Tc8c5s, imagine you lead out and get raised. In many cases, you will want to 3-bet right here to build the pot and protect your strong hand against the draws.
3-betting for value is a simple concept that needs little explanation, although sizing up your value 3-bets and picking the right spot to 3-bet for value can still be a bit tricky at times.
3-betting as a bluff is a lot more complicated than 3-betting for value. Many novice players never 3-bet as a bluff, and this is one of their big mistakes.
There are many reasons to 3-bet as a bluff, but the most important is balance. If you only ever bet huge hands, your opponents will start folding to them way too much.
Even to an untrained eye, a player who only 3-bets once every hour will seem tight. Most players will not want to take their chances and will fold a lot to such an opponent.
A player who 3-bets as a bluff often will get a lot of action and will often be able to get a lot of money into the pot with his premiums.
On the other hand, it is also important to make sure your 3-bet bluffing range is not too weak and that you don’t 3-bet bluff too often so as not to get exploited by players playing back at you too much.
Before you start three-betting with bluffs, brush up on how to bluff!
When it comes to picking the time and the hand to 3-bet with before the flop, you will want to make sure to balance between your value hands and your bluffs as much as possible.
This balancing act is one of the big things that separate poker pros from the fish and one of the things you will need to master on your way to poker greatness.
By 3-betting the right hands before the flop as bluffs, you will get a chance to win some dead money at times and play pots after the flop in which you will have the initiative and a good chance to win an even bigger pot.
As long as you don’t allow your bluffing range in these spots to become too weak, your 3-bet bluffs will help you make more money with your premium hands, and your overall 3-betting strategy will work like a charm.
To crush cash games like Rampage poker, you must maintain a balanced 3-betting range.
We have already talked about the difference between 3-betting for value and 3-betting as a bluff and the importance of mixing the two to make your 3-betting range balanced.
Now, it’s time to talk about some extra goals that we can accomplish by 3-betting your poker hands instead of calling in certain spots, even in situations when both plays are viable.
These include:
When playing poker, you always want to play as much as possible against players who are weaker than you and as little as possible with those who are stronger.
For that reason, 3-betting is a very strong strategy when faced with players who open a lot of hands but are generally not very strong poker players.
In many lower-stakes games, you will see fish come into many pots with a “standard” open, and their range will be made up of all sorts of hands.
When facing such opponents, 3-betting their raises with a merged range, which we will discuss next, will allow you to stay heads-up with them and win many pots on further betting streets.
Multi-way pots are some of the trickiest spots in poker, and 3-betting is one of our tools to ensure that we don’t play too many such pots when not necessary.
In live cash games, in particular, you will often see one player raise it, and several players make the call. These players will sometimes have hands as weak as 5-3 off-suit, making a “squeeze play” a great idea.
When faced with such multi-way situations, 3-betting will often do the trick of allowing you to play the pot against just one player instead of two, three, or more.
The more people you can get out of the pot, the more equity you will eliminate from the pot, thus allowing yourself to win more money in the long run.
There is a lot to be said about being aggressive and having the lead in a hand of poker, and 3-betting achieves just that.
By firing that 3-bet before the flop, you tell your opponents that you might have a hand as strong as KK or AA, and they have no real way of knowing if you do.
On the other hand, whenever you call a preflop raise, you generally cap your range, making it nearly impossible to represent strong hands on high boards.
While you could balance this out by adding some of those strongest hands to your calling range, you would be losing value by not building pots with such hands.
So, 3-bet often and 3-bet with the right ranges, and you will end up being able to win more pots with flop c-bets, delayed c-bets, and other powerful plays that separate the best players from the rest of the pack.
Being aggressive preflop allows you to apply additional pressure later in the hand.
When considering which range of hands to 3-bet before the flop, there are a number of factors that come into play, such as the position your opponent opened the pot from, your position, stack sizes, and player profile.
Your main decision will be whether to use a merged range or a polarized range to 3-bet, and we will discuss 3-betting with a merged range first.
A merged range, by definition, is a range that includes no pure bluffs but rather only strong hands and hands that have good playability.
A merged 3-betting range should be used against strong poker players opening from early positions and against calling stations, as in both of these scenarios, folds are unlikely.
For instance, a strong player opening from UTG will not have many hands that fold to an SB 3-bet, so 3-betting with a hand like 97s does not make much sense against them.
Similarly, a calling station who always sticks around after a 3-bet should not be 3-bet with hands that rate to be underdogs to his opening range, as this does not accomplish too much.
Instead, a merged range made up of hands like AA-77, AK, AQ, AKs-ATs, and suited Broadway hands can be used in such scenarios, as all these hands can be ahead of the opening range or play extremely well against it.
Even if we know our opponent is strong, we can’t just 3-bet our strongest hands, as this would make us extremely easy to play against.
Exactly opposite of a merged range is a polarized range, which is made up exclusively of the strongest hands and pure bluffs, while all other hands are played differently.
A polarized 3-betting range can be used against players who are very likely to fold to a 3-bet, and this is especially common in online games where you may have stats on players.
If a player opens the pot from a late position and has a very high fold to 3-bet stat, then your decision should be to 3-bet with a polarized range.
Another common scenario in which you should almost always be 3-betting a polarized range is when you find yourself in the big blind, as you can proceed with most of your suited hands and many other connected or A-high hands and call profitably.
So, in such a scenario, you can go ahead and 3-bet your strongest hands like AA-TT, AK, AQ, AKs-AJs, and KQs, while also adding in pure bluffs like J4s, 76s, 53s, 32s, and similar hands to your range as bluffs.
With such a range, you will still have a range that’s well balanced between value and bluffs, but you will not be bluffing with a hand like 98s that you can easily profitably call with and play later streets.

Once you have decided which hands you want to 3-bet in a given spot, you will also want to decide how much to make it.
In most cases, assuming you are playing against somewhat perceptive players, you don’t want to size up your raises based on the value of your particular hand.
Instead, you will want to 3-bet your entire chosen range to a particular size, and that size should mostly relate to position.
Being out of position against the original raiser necessarily means that you will have a more difficult time realizing your equity should the hand go post-flop, which means you will benefit more from folds.
For that reason, you want to make your out-of-position 3-bets bigger than your in-position 3-bets but don’t go too crazy.
A good rule of thumb in today’s cash games is to 3-bet anywhere between 3x and 3.5x the original raise size in position and somewhere around 4x to 4.5x out of position. For tournaments, you can use slightly smaller sizing.
So, if a player opens to $10 from the cutoff in your $2/5 cash game, consider making it $30 to $35 if you are the button but $40 to $45 if you are the small blind.
This way, you will ensure that you play more 3-bet pots postflop in position and fewer out of position, which will change the outcomes of these spots by quite a bit in the long run.
Before executing a three-bet, take your time and consider your bet size.
You now have the basics of a strong poker strategy for 3-betting under your belt, and you can start thinking about how to apply these in your games.
The next time you are sitting at a poker table, and you are dealt a hand you usually just call a raise with, think about this guide and consider whether a 3-bet might be more appropriate.
Once you master the 3-bet strategy, you will find yourself 3-betting often and your opponents guessing your cards instead of knowing them, which makes all the difference in the big picture.
A 3-bet in poker refers to the third bet in a betting sequence. Typically, 3-betting refers to re-raising before the flop when another player has already raised. Since one bet is already active before the flop, the second raise is referred to as a 3-bet.
There are two main reasons to 3-bet in poker and these are for value and as a bluff. You want to 3-bet your strong hands for value, and you want to 3-bet some weaker hands as a bluff. By 3-betting both hand categories, you can create a balanced 3-betting range that is hard to exploit.
You can balance your 3-betting range by adding bluffing hands into the range on top of your value hands. By creating a mix of value and bluffs, you will keep your 3-betting range unpredictable and prevent your opponents from exploiting your 3-betting tendencies.
The exact 3-betting range you should use depends on your own position, the original raiser’s position and tendencies, as well as stack sizes. However, you will typically want to bet all the strongest hands like AA, KK, QQ, and AK, as well as a mix of bluffing hands like A2s and A5s. You can expand both the value and the bluffing range as the original raiser’s position gets later and their raising range expands.
The size of your 3-bets should not always be the same. Your position should dictate how big you make your 3-bets. When 3-betting in position, you should make a smaller raise than when you are doing it from out of position. You should make your 3-bets between 3x and 3.5x the original raise IP and between 4x and 4.5x the original raise OOP.
By 3-betting a portion of your preflop range, you will gain many advantages. 3-betting allows you to isolate limpers, reduce the number of players in the hand, take initiative, and even win pots outright. Entering pots as the 3-bettor is often more beneficial than calling raises, as it allows you to win the pot without further action and represents a stronger range than you would have if you just called a raise.
A 3-bet is the third bet made in a pot, while a 4-bet is the fourth. Looking at preflop action, a 3-bet is the name assigned to the second raise, while the third raise is typically called a 4-bet. Your 4-betting range should be even narrower and tighter than your 3-betting range in poker.
### TOPIC: bet sizing strategy
Being a well-rounded poker player means mastering many different skills that allow you to navigate the streets and outsmart your opponents. Bet sizing is definitely one of the most important ones, and despite playing the game for years, many poker players don’t fully understand it.
If you hope to become an elite poker player, mastering the art of bet sizing in poker should be one of your primary concerns.
Today, we take a look at some of the most important and useful tips you should keep in mind every time you play the game.
If you have not given bet sizing too much thought before, these tips should dramatically improve your game almost instantly. So keep reading and make a few easy adjustments to give yourself the extra edge you have been looking for.
Effective bet sizing is crucial for maximizing value, applying pressure, and maintaining a balanced strategy. Here are key insights to enhance your bet sizing approach:* Develop a Cohesive Strategy: Avoid basing bet sizes solely on hand strength. Instead, consider how your range interacts with your opponent’s range and the board texture.* Small Bets on Dry Boards: On boards with low connectivity (e.g., 4♣3♦3♠), employ small bets (25–33% of the pot) across your entire range to exploit opponents’ likely misses.* Larger Bets on Wet Boards: On coordinated boards (e.g., T♠9♠7♣), use larger bets (70–100% of the pot) with strong value hands and select bluffs, as opponents are more likely to have drawing hands.* Adjust for Position: When out of position, increase your 3-bet sizing (typically 4–4.5x the original raise) to compensate for the positional disadvantage.* Consider Stack Sizes: Plan your bet sizes to ensure effective stack-to-pot ratios (SPR) for future streets, enabling you to apply consistent pressure or value extraction.* Polarize on the Turn: Transition to a polarized betting strategy on the turn, betting larger with strong hands and bluffs while checking medium-strength hands to maintain balance.* Overbet with Nut Advantage: On the river, when your range contains the nuts and your opponent’s does not, consider overbetting to maximize value and pressure.By integrating these principles into your game, you can enhance your strategic depth and exploit opponents more effectively.
One of the most common mistakes poker players make regarding bet sizing is sizing their bets based on the strength and absolute value of their hands. Inexperienced players often only bet big with their strong hands while making small bets with their less valuable hands.
Modern bet sizing theory, however, tells us that bet sizing is all about figuring out how strong our range is against our opponent’s range on a particular board texture. This concept is the foundation of a strong bet sizing strategy.
The reality is that there is no one-size-fits-all betting strategy that you can memorize once and apply in every scenario, as every hand of poker is different in some way.
However, using the bet sizing tips we will present here, you should be able to make some well-informed decisions about what size to bet in any poker hand you play in the future.
As we already mentioned, the most important factor to consider when determining how much to bet on a poker hand is the board texture.
When you enter the pot as the aggressor and are considering making a c-bet, you will need to examine the flop and decide how likely your opponent is to continue, as well as how likely they are to have a big hand.
Dry boards that make it unlikely for a player who defended against a raise to hit are ideal candidates for us to bet 100% of our raising range.
For example, imagine opening from the Cutoff before the flop and getting a call from the big blind. The flop comes 4d3h3c, and your opponent checks to you.
In this scenario, there is nearly no reason to believe our opponent has much of anything. They can have a pair or trips with a very small percentage of their range, along with a few draws, while everything else will have completely missed the board.
A small bet with our entire range makes sense here because our opponent will be forced to fold their 9s7s or JhTc regardless of how much we bet, while they will call both a small or a big bet with a pair of Fives or trip Treys.
Small bets work like a charm on boards like this, especially because most opponents won’t be looking to fight back too much and will give up on the hand when they see they have missed.
What’s more, our opponent in the scenario we described cannot have strong starting hands like AA or KK, while we can, which gives our range a big advantage.
As a general rule of thumb, use a bet sizing of 25% to 33% on dry boards like this one, and you will be printing money by getting to win the pot right then and there with minimum risk.
We have discussed bet sizing on dry boards and why it makes sense to bet small on them, but now it’s time to discuss what happens when the flop is much more connected.
On wet boards, as we like to call them, you should be betting fewer hands but making your bets bigger while checking back a decent portion of your range as well.
For instance, imagine the same scenario as earlier: We open the Cutoff and get a BB caller, but the board runs Ts9s7c.
On this board, it is much more likely that our opponent has connected in some way, as there are countless straights, two pairs, one pair, and drawing hands that they could continue with.
For that reason, we will not want to c-bet a hand like AK, AQ, or 43 suited, as these hands have very little equity against our opponent’s continuing range.
Instead, this is a great board to bet with hands like T9 suited, TT, 99, 77, and J8 suited, all of which have improved significantly on the flop.
To balance that out, hands like AsXs, QJ suited, or A8 suited make for great bluffing candidates, which we can add to our betting range.
So, instead of betting 100% of our preflop range with a small sizing, we will bet anywhere between 70% of the pot and the full pot but at a much lower frequency.
On wet boards, you never want to bet with hands that have no real equity against the opponent’s calling range, but rather create a strong mix of value hands and powerful bluffs to continue with.
When it comes to preflop raise sizing, the importance of position must be taken into account, and this is especially true when talking about 3-bets.
3-betting from the button is not the same as 3-betting from the small blind, and there is a great incentive to 3-bet quite a bit bigger when you are playing the rest of the hand out of position.
As we well know by now, the in-position player gets to realize their equity a lot easier than the out-of-position player, which means the player in position will have the advantage when they decide to continue with the hand.
For that reason, making your 3-bets larger out of position will help compensate for the positional disadvantage, as you will get to win the pot outright more often with a larger 3-bet.
As a general rule of thumb, you can make your 3-bets about 3-3.5x the raise in position and 4-4.5x the raise out of position, and the impact of this should show up in your results after some repetitions.
Another important factor to consider when deciding your bet sizing is the effective stack size and how your chosen bet size will impact your bets on future streets.
The key to proper bet sizing is planning ahead and thinking about how the pot will look if you apply one bet size instead of another.
When making a flop bet, you should make sure to size it up so that you are either going all-in on the turn if the stack-to-pot ratio is small or that you can bet both turn and river for reasonable bet sizes at higher stack-to-pot ratios.
It is a big mistake to make your flop and turn bets too big and end up on the river with only a fraction of the pot left behind, as this means you can’t effectively bet the bluff portion of your range.
On the other hand, you don’t want to bet too small on the flop either and end up going all-in for two times the pot on the turn, as this also unbalances your entire strategy.
Instead, your ideal bet sizing strategy should be based on stack size and stack-to-pot ratio considerations. Every bet should anticipate the next, ensuring the bet sizing makes sense across all betting streets.
You now know how to size your bets on the flop by betting your entire range small on dry boards and betting a fraction of your range on wet boards for a bigger sizing.
Now, it’s time to talk about poker strategy for turn bets, how often you should fire them, and how big you should make them. Perhaps, to your surprise, the best strategy for the turn is not to include any small bets at all.
Once you have reached the turn, you should only bet with a polarized range, which means only your strong hands and your bluffs will keep on firing.
Since you are betting a polarized range, it makes sense to bet big, and most pros recommend betting around 70% of the pot or more on turns.
As for all your other hands, checking the turn makes a lot of sense, as it will allow you to have plenty of hands that still have decent value on the river.
For example, imagine betting the flop on a Th9h4s board and seeing the turn of 7d roll off.
At this point, you will definitely want to keep barreling with a hand like T9 or TT, as well as QJ or Ah8h, but a hand like A9 does not make too much sense to keep betting.
Instead, you can use this hand as a great bluff catcher on the river if your opponent decides to bet into you or even a value bet if they decide to check.
As for your weak hands that bet the flop and checked the turn, you will now be able to bluff with them on the river, representing the exact type of middling hand that checked the turn for pot control and is now betting for value.
By applying this betting strategy on the turn, you will prepare a great situation for your entire range on the river and be able to play all your hands profitably over and over again.
Overbets were not used much in poker until fairly recently when GTO players discovered that solvers liked to overbet the river in situations where they have the nut advantage.
What this means is that if you reach the river and you are the only one who can have the nuts, you can profitably make a bet bigger than the size of the pot with your actual nuts and appropriate bluffs.
For instance, on a board of KsQs8h7h5s, the overbet size is appropriate with a hand like AsTs, but also one like AsTh, which ensures that your opponent cannot have the nut flush in their hand.
Furthermore, you can apply overbets in situations where you are the only player who can have the top set or top full house on A-high or K-high boards if you were the original aggressor before the flop.
Anytime your range is heavily favored against your opponents, a river overbet allows you to get the most fold with your bluffs and get paid big when your opponent does find a call and you have the actual nuts in your hand.
Bet sizing is easily one of the most underrated skills in poker, and most recreational players have no real concept of it.
If you want to truly master the game and have an elite win rate, you will need to become an expert on bet sizing across the board.
To get started, we recommend focusing on certain spots and situations that come up a lot, such as c-betting flops on dry and wet boards or continuing with a turn bet after a flop c-bet.
Once you have mastered common situations like this, your overall results will be immediately impacted, and you will notice the difference in your bottom line quite soon.
Leave thinking about the less common situations in Texas Hold’em for a time when you are comfortable with bet sizing in the more common spots, and you will give yourself room for future growth and nearly endless potential to improve and win more with each passing session.
### TOPIC: bluff catching
Here’s another great topic gleaned from the PokerCoaching Discord server. It started innocently enough with a hand from a regular poster named Kevin. Here’s a link to the entire thread if you want it, but I hope this piece will give you a good summary of the discussion. Kevin found himself in a bluff catching spot on the river of a no-limit hold’em game. He was worried that a winning regular player (“reg”) was bluffing him, and felt that he had to call “sometimes.”
What he said exactly was, “I don’t know exactly why, but I feel compelled to flick in the call, because we have to call sometimes or we get run over.”
This is a common concern for a lot of poker players – we fear getting bluffed out of a pot. But let’s look at the math of the situation, because that, not fear, should drive our decisions.
I wish I could take credit for that line, but I learned it from former poker theorist Nate Meyvis. I say “former,” because Nate has left the poker world to pursue other interests. Nate, poker misses you.
Here’s a simple explanation of what Nate means, courtesy of Andrew Brokos, and his excellent book, Play Optimal Poker. Suppose you owe a poker buddy $100, and would like to avoid them for a little while so you don’t have to pay them back yet. Each day you go to play poker, at either Casino Alpha or Casino Beta. You know that your friend also plays poker at those two casinos, and chooses them by flipping a coin, so they have a 50% probability of being at each casino. What is your best (literally GTO) strategy for avoiding them? You should also flip a coin to choose between the two casinos – this will maximize your chances of missing your friend. If you flip a coin, there’s a 50% chance that you will see your friend, so your expected “loss” (having to pay back the $100) is $50.
But suppose you learn that your friend prefers the coffee at Casino Alpha, so has slightly altered their routine. They play at Casino Alpha with probability 0.52, and Casino Beta with probability 0.48. Note that now the GTO strategy for avoiding your friend is to always play at Casino Beta. Each time you play at Casino Beta, your expected loss is $48 – $2 less than you expected to lose when your friend had a “balanced” casino choice strategy. Note also that every time you show up at Casino Alpha, your expected loss is $52, $4 more than choosing Casino Beta.
So even though your friend made only a tiny change to their casino choice strategy, your correct response is to radically change your casino choice.
This is what Nate means by, “They move an inch, we move a mile.”

Some people in the thread were looking at the various bluffs the opponent might have and the features of Kevin’s hand as a bluff catcher. But PokerCoaching moderator Joey P, the MTT Hero, cut to the chase. Here is a minimally edited version of what he wrote:
You are complicating things a bit. Let’s work with a general assumption: In most games, the population does not bluff the river often enough to be “balanced.”
A balanced bluffing range is bluffing at the identical frequency of the pot odds.The example I like to use is there is $100 in the pot and your opponent bets $100. Your pot odds are 2:1 and therefore their bluffs should be 2:1.If he has 20 combos in his value range he is supposed to find ten bluff combinations. When you have a pure bluff catcher – i.e. a hand that never beats any hand in his value range, your EV is 0 to call versus a balanced range.If instead he only bluffs nine instead of ten hands, then every bluff catcher that you call with, you are losing $100 21 times and winning $200 nine times, and your total EV is -$10 per call. Therefore, according to the pot odds math, you should never call with a bluff catcher if they are not bluffing often enough.
“You should never call with a bluff catcher if they are not bluffing often enough.“
Note that in Brokos’ debt avoidance problem, if our friend has a balanced casino choice strategy (they flip a coin) then the best we can do is flip a coin. It’s only when they move off of equilibrium that we can exploit them. So it is trying to catch bluffs. If our opponent correctly balances their bluffs (e.g. bluffs exactly 1/3 of the time in the example above) then the best we can do is call them at Minimum Defense Frequency (“MDF”). MDF is the percentage of time we have to call to prevent our opponent from profiting by always bluffing.
But there’s great news…
99.999% of poker players under-bluff on the river.
While this runs counter to all the GTO discussion you hear these days, there is a constant refrain from the best thinkers in the business that the huge majority of poker players simply don’t find enough bluffs on the river to reach equilibrium.
Joey had more to say on this topic:
I used to advise the opposite. I would advise people to stay at GTO until they have evidence they are under-bluffing. However, upon listening to advice given to me by other coaches here, my experience, and checking my database, I have switched my advice on this spot. Here is a spot I think we can more profitably deviate from GTO until we find GTO is needed. To me, the better course of action in this type of spot is to exploit as the standard, and deviate back to GTO for certain players.
I suspect you can play a lot of poker before you find that unicorn who is bluffing at equilibrium. When you do, start calling at MDF, and drop me a note to tell me about it.
But until then, don’t think about what bluffs they might have, or the bluff catching properties of your hand. Like avoiding your coffee-connoiseur friend, simply never call, unless you can beat some of their value hands.
Does that mean that you never get bluffed? Absolutely not. In our “pot-size bet with 20 value hands,” if your opponent only finds nine of the ten appropriate bluffs, that means you get bluffed out of the pot nine times out of 30.
Humans – man, we don’t like getting bluffed. After all, you’re being lied to. When you call a value bet, you at least have the consolation of being told the truth. When you are successfully bluffed, it’s a double whammy – you were lied to, and because you believed the lie, you lost the pot. This can be tough on the psyche. That’s why it’s best to leave your psyche out of your poker decisions.
Look, even by exploiting your lender friend’s coffee preference, you still get caught 48% of the time and have to pay off your debt. 30% of the time in our example above, you get bluffed out of your shoes. But every time you fold, you are saving $10. Even the times where your opponent has absolute air.
So we have to be okay with getting bluffed – that is a part of the game, if we want to have a chance of winning. As Brokos likes to say, “The best poker players fold to bluffs quite often. Conversely, players who never fold to bluffs are always welcome at the poker table.”

My poker results improved dramatically when I just stopped calling river bets unless I honestly felt I could beat some of my opponent’s value bets. If they bluffed me, good for them – I still profited by folding.
Joey P had this epiphany as well. Here’s how he described it:
Also, I have to report that, for the past month, when I returned to cash from only MTTs for a while, I have decided to never bluff catch on the river (unless I had enough hands for an accurate read for a maniac). Without ever bluff-catching, and finding the fold button 100% on the river with bluff catchers, my intermediate results are astonishing. I’m at 22BB/100 in the past month. So what I am telling you, I have actually put into practice and it is definitely working. All of that profit is because I am not giving some back with bluff-catching.
Neither Joey nor I can promise you 22BB/100. But the collective wisdom across the poker space is that our opponents are under-bluffing the river, relative to optimal frequency. And we can exploit them by simply folding.
Kevin replied to Joey’s comments, thanking him for the detailed answers. But he wondered, “Another thing you said is that you would want evidence [that the bettor is a maniac], but if we never call how do we ever get it?”
I already had the answer ready for that one – I’ve been giving out this advice for years:I’ve been preaching this for years. No matter what you think, people are not picking specifically on you. 90% of players will play identically against 90% of the field. Nobody made you town sheriff.  So just watch and let the other players pay for your information.
Any time you find yourself in a spot where you think your opponent may be different from the average player, I’ve got a piece of advice:
Let the other people at the table pay for the information about how an unknown player behaves.
Of course, that means you need to be watching the table rather than scrolling Instagram when you’re not in hands. But let’s say that you suspect the #6 seat of bluffing too much. Sit back and watch for 45 minutes – I promise that such a player will reveal their true colors within that time period. You don’t have to spend your chips to get the information.
Andrew Brokos, who first taught me this whole “inch→mile” principle, is fond of saying: “Even against the GTO-perfect bluffing opponent, ‘I need to fold sometimes’ is just as true as, ‘I need to call sometimes,’ yet it is said so much less often.”
That’s because poker players want to call. They want to win the pot. They don’t want to be bluffed. Every emotional instinct in us wants to call in these river bluff catching spots. But the mathematics of poker have no bias whatsoever toward that – calling and folding are simply two choices, and the numbers guide us in one direction or the other. In the real poker world, that direction, almost always, is toward “fold.”
So there you go, Kevin – you don’t need to call sometimes. Just fold this time, and the next time too. You’ll get bluffed occasionally, but every time you fold, you’ll be printing money.And thank you so much for bringing your hand to our Discord group. It was a great discussion, I learned some things, and I think others did as well. I look forward to your next post.
### TOPIC: cbet on ace high boards
Building a strategy for how to c-bet on ace-high boards with different textures is not an easy task, and there is no better way than to break the strategy into different sections.
Today, we will use PeakGTO to analyze ace-high flop examples.
We will cover both dry and connected boards when tackling these situations both in position and out of position to illustrate strategy differences, and will wrap it up with core takeaways for each situation.
In Position (IP) on Dry Boards (e.g., A♠9♥3♣): Utilize a small bet sizing (~1/3 pot) and c-bet approximately 57% of the time. This approach leverages your range advantage and applies pressure on the big blind’s weaker holdings.n Position (IP) on Connected/Wet Boards (e.g., A♥9♦8♦): Reduce c-bet frequency to around 37% and opt for a larger bet sizing (~2/3 pot). The increased connectivity and potential draws warrant a more cautious approach, often checking back stronger hands to control the pot size.Out of Position (OOP) on Dry Boards (e.g., A♠9♥4♣): Adopt a predominantly checking strategy, c-betting less than 4% of the time. This conservative approach acknowledges the positional disadvantage and the opponent’s potential to capitalize on aggression.Out of Position on Connected/Wet Boards (e.g., A♦9♠8♠): Maintain a checking frequency of approximately 95%. When facing a bet after checking, defend your range by calling with top pairs, strong draws, and occasionally check-raising with your strongest hands to balance your play.
Your c-betting ranges will depend on your and your opponent’s positions, but we will use an example of wide ranges where you open from the button and are called by the big blind.
Here are the assumptions we will be using:
Let’s take an example of an As9h3c flop when BTN raises before the flop, BB calls and then checks to the preflop raiser.
In this scenario, the solver suggests c-betting 57% of hands and checking 43% of the time while having a mixed strategy with most of your holdings.
It is important to note that you should nearly always use a small bet sizing of around 1/3rd of the pot when you decide to bet on ace-high boards in position on a dry board.
If we take the example of a more connected flop such as Ah9d8d, your strategy changes quite a bit, and you will now check back much more often.
In this situation, you will be betting around 37% of the time and checking almost 63% of your range (compared to checking just 43% on a dry board).
Just like in the previous example, we are using the fairly mixed betting strategy with most of the hands, but this time, we usually pick bigger bet sizing of 2/3rds of the pot on connected boards.
Of course, your strategy changes significantly when you are out of position, so let’s look at similar examples for both dry and wet boards. Now, we will analyze the situation using these core assumptions:
Let’s look at As9h4c to see how our strategy changes when we are OOP.
In this scenario, we only c-bet a small part of our range, betting the bottom set sometimes, a few stronger Ax hands, and some gutshots. That being said, we will check over 96% of the time.
There is no need to get fancy here since checking your entire range makes it very easy to play going forward since you will have all of the strong poker hands.
Actually, when you are out of position, you will have to use a very similar strategy, even on connected boards. Let’s take a look at the Ad9s8s example.
As you can see, you will be checking here around 95% of the time, so the initial strategy OOP is very similar on both dry and connected boards, where you end up checking most of the time.
When you face a bet, you will have to apply MDF based on your opponent’s bet sizing.
If your opponent is using bigger bet sizing as he should, you need to continue around 56% of the time. From those 56% of your range, you should be calling 51% of the time and raising just around 5% of your hands.
Here, you can apply a very straightforward approach by raising only your strongest hands, like sets and two pairs some of the time, and balancing it out with few open-enders. As for calling, you will want to continue with top pairs, flush draws, and hands that have some equity and fold the rest.
### TOPIC: cbet on high card boards ip
peak_ad id=”2542003″
We already talked about c-betting on low-card boards and high-card flops in 3-bet pots, so today we will use the PeakGTO to analyze strategy on ace-high boards.
We will cover different board textures on connected and dry boards to identify strategy differences after 3-betting preflop and summarize key takeaways for each section.
To start, we will dive deeper into an example where we 3-bet from the button versus a cutoff open, and he calls to see the flop.
Key assumptions:
Let’s firstly look at a dry board of As7h2c to see our strategy in this situation when CO checks to us.
In this spot, the solver suggests betting 90% of the time and checking 10% of your range.
We check a few combinations of Ax, pocket pairs, and a few broadways, but keep the pressure on the opponent and continue barreling quite aggressively with everything else.
Of course, not all flops will be equal. The more connected the board becomes, the less often we will be betting, and our poker range that wants to check back will be expanding.
As far as connected boards go, let’s look at an example of As9d8d.
As you can see, the game theory optimal strategy here is almost the opposite compared to a dry board. In this situation, we end up checking 73% of the time and betting only with 27% of our hands.
There are no pure bets on connected flops, but we will be checking back pocket pairs almost 100% of the time. Everything else uses a mixed strategy, distributing our betting and checking hands across the board.
As for the sizing, we also stick with a small one-third pot size bets in almost all cases.
Key takeaways
Now, let’s look at hands when we are 3-betting out of position (OOP) and analyze a scenario where our opponent opens from the button, we 3-bet from the big blind, and he calls.
Key assumptions:
Let’s look at As8h3d to see how we should approach dry boards.
PeakGTO suggests betting 59% of the time and checking 41% of your range on this board.
While our c-betting range is spread throughout all of the hands, there are a few holdings that bet more often. Namely, you will want to bet your strongest Ax hands, a few suited connectors, and broadway combinations.
This time we are mixing bet sizes between small and large bets, but still use small sizing most of the time.
To see the differences on connected boards, let’s look at the example of Ah9h8d.
In this 3-betting spot, we should be checking around 52% of the time and betting 48% of our hands, so our strategy is distributed quite evenly across the range.
That said, there are a few hands that lean towards c-betting more often – our strongest top pairs like AK and AQ, gutshots, and open-enders.
As for the sizing, we are using 25% pot size bet about half of the time when we are betting, and 60% pot size bet for th rest of the hands. Hands like pocket pairs and weaker aces like ATs, A7s, and A5s. The rest are mixed between those small and big bets.
These connected boards has a more complicated mixed strategy, but it is important to balance your ranges well to avoid being exploited.
Key takeaways

### TOPIC: cbetting low card boards
In previous articles, we covered the optimal c-betting strategy for ace-high and high-card boards. Today, we will analyze c-betting low card boards to break down the GTO play.
We will cover both dry and connected board textures. We will also review in-position and out-of-position play to illustrate what adjustments you should make and share key takeaways from these situations.
In Position (IP) on Dry Low Boards (e.g., 9♠-5♣-2♦): As the preflop aggressor, you have a significant range advantage. The solver recommends c-betting over 67% of the time, primarily using larger bet sizes (around two-thirds of the pot).​In Position on Connected Low Boards (e.g., 8♠-7♠-5♦): These boards are more favorable to the big blind’s range. The solver suggests c-betting less frequently, focusing on hands with equity (like overpairs and strong draws) and often employing smaller bet sizes.​Out of Position (OOP) on Dry Low Boards (e.g., 9♣-5♥-3♣): Without the advantage of position, it’s advisable to check almost your entire range. When you do c-bet, choose hands with strong equity and consider smaller bet sizes to control the pot.​Out of Position on Connected Low Boards (e.g., 8♠-7♠-5♦): These boards are particularly challenging. The solver recommends a cautious approach, with minimal c-betting, focusing on hands that can withstand aggression and opting for smaller bet sizes.
To better understand wide poker ranges, we will use examples when we open from the BTN, get called by the BB, and then have our hands checked after the flop.
Key assumptions:
Let’s take an example of a dry board containing 9h5c2d to see how the solver suggests handling these situations.
This is a board that clearly favors the preflop aggressor. You can have more overpairs and other strong hands, giving you a significant range advantage. Because of this, c-betting low card boards like this encourages you to bet aggressively and even pick a bigger bet-sizing.
In this exact situation, PeakGTO suggests c-betting over 67% of the time and mostly using big bets of slightly over two-thirds of the pot.
The best way to approach these situations is to use a mixed strategy of betting your strong hands and draws most of the time. The only hands that you should always be checking back are some Ax hands that can even win some pots at the showdown and will help you balance your range quite well.
If we take a wet board such as 8s7s5d as an example, your strategy changes almost to the opposite approach.
Contrary to the previous example, you will only need to c-bet around 33% of the time and will check back most of the time.
Our c-betting range in this situation is split between various hands. As in most situations, we apply a mixed strategy betting with our made hands, combo draws, and some pure bluffs.
A game theory optimal strategy also preferred smaller bet sizing usually betting less than one-third of the pot.
This is not a surprise since this board is much better for the big blind calling range. We will have a hard time putting our opponent under pressure since he has a range advantage in this situation, so controlling the size of the pot is beneficial for us.
Your approach to these situations changes significantly when you are out of position, so let’s take a couple of examples and see how we should adjust in these situations.
Our assumptions:
The first example we are going to look into is 9c5h3s.
When being OOP, you should check pretty much your entire range, with the optimal strategy being checking 94% of the time and betting just 6% of your hands.
By checking most of your hands, you protect your range and keep the pot smaller, giving yourself a chance to play well when facing a bet since you will have many strong hands in your range that you could use for both calling and raising.
When you end up checking, you will face a bet from your opponent around 60% of the time, so you need to adapt an aggressive check-raising strategy and also call quite a few of the hands to avoid being exploited.
Overpairs, sets, and overcards for the bluffing part of the range are perfect candidates for check-raising, while you can be check-calling most A-highs and other hands with some equity.
If we take 8s7s5d to cover more coordinated boards, you will see that now you need to check effectively always, meaning you should never be c-betting low card boards like this.
Since you do not have a betting range on connected boards out of position, your strategy becomes quite simple. You mostly need to concentrate on being able to play well when facing a bet after you check.
In this situation, you also need to defend many hands and apply an aggressive check-raising strategy since your opponent will be betting a lot.
When facing a small bet from the button, you need to call 56% of the hands and check-raise around 18%.
Your sets and some overpairs are the most obvious value poker hands to check-raise, while flush and straight draws are the best check-raise candidates for bluffing. As for calling, apply the mixed strategy throughout your range with all other holdings and only fold broadway combinations with higher frequency than other hands.
### TOPIC: cbetting on high card boards
We recently covered a complete strategy for c-betting on ace-high boards, and now we will dive deeper into high-card flops from KsQs9d to Jh6d2s.
Like before, we will use PeakGTO to analyze these examples. We will cover both connected and dry boards while being IP and OOP so you will fully understand how to play in these situations. Let’s jump straight into the hands.
In Position (IP) on Dry Boards (e.g., J♥6♦2♠): C-bet approximately 74% of the time, favoring a larger bet size of around 2/3 pot. This approach helps deny equity and applies pressure on the big blind’s weaker holdings.In Position on Connected/Wet Boards (e.g., K♥7♣6♣): Reduce c-bet frequency to about 59%, often opting for smaller bet sizes. The increased connectivity and potential draws warrant a more cautious approach, with a balanced range including top pairs and bluffs.Out of Position (OOP) on Dry Boards (e.g., K♥6♠2♦): Despite being out of position, c-bet around 60% of the time, primarily using larger bet sizes (~2/3 pot) to leverage range advantage.Out of Position on Connected/Wet Boards (e.g., K♠Q♠9♦): Decrease c-bet frequency to approximately 46%, favoring smaller bet sizes (~1/3 pot). The presence of potential draws necessitates a more conservative strategy, incorporating strong hands and bluffs without showdown value.
While the strategy changes based on your position and opening ranges since you play more hands from the BTN than in earlier positions, many of the underlying principles work similarly.
Therefore, we will concentrate on examples with wide ranges and cover situations when we open from the BTN and get called by the big blind. Here are assumptions we will be using:
Let’s take an example of Jh6d2s and see how our strategy looks on this dry board.
In this situation, we should be c-betting with 74% of our range, usually picking the bigger size of 2/3rds of the pot. That said, we also use small sizing quite a bit so we will have to mix between these two options.
Increasing c-bet size helps deny your opponent’s equity and put him in much tougher situations with overcards and runner runner draws.
As you can see, the entire betting range uses a mixed strategy, but some of the highest-frequency bets are overpairs, strong top-pairs, and even second pairs with an overcard to the board. These bets are accompanied by gutshots and some runner-runner draws for balance.
Similar strategy applies for Kxx and Qxx boards. As a rule of thumb, the lower the highest card, the less often you will be c-betting.
If we take the example of a more connected board like Kh7c6c, we will have to make some adjustments.
The most obvious difference is that we will now be checking back more often, and our c-betting range is only 59% in this situation. We will also want to use smaller bet sizes more often than big ones, which might initially be counterintuitive.
Our betting range is fairly mixed here as well, but you want to be c-betting top pairs most of the time.
What is interesting is that a game theory optimal strategy is using your air hands such as Q9s, J5s, and even small Ax hands as a bluff. Since BB should be 3-betting most of the strong Kx hands preflop, we can get away with this strategy and get many folds.
When you find yourself out of position, you will need to adjust your approach significantly and check more hands, so let’s analyze a few examples with these assumptions:
Let’s firstly look at the dry board of Kh6s2d.
Even being OOP, the solver suggests betting around 60% of the time. It also clearly favors big bet sizes, picking a 2/3 pot size bet in almost all situations because of a significant range advantage.
With the mixed strategy across the board with the same hands betting some of the time and checking the rest, it is not easy to group specific hands that you want to play one way or another. One thing that we can distinguish is that you want to be c-betting your top-pairs a lot of the time, and add air hands with a runner runner potential as the bluffs.
If we go to more connected boards and take KsQs9d as an example, our c-betting % shrinks even further.
Here we end up c-betting around 46% of the time, this time almost always picking small sizing of around 1/3rd of the pot.
While we end up using a mixed strategy here as well, you should end up c-betting all of your strong hands around two-thirds of the time, followed with bluffs that do not have any showdown value.
It is worth noticing that in situations where there is no flush draw on the board you will need to c-bet much more frequently. For instance, if we take the same flop cards but make it KsQh9d, you need to c-bet over 80% of the time since your opponent will have significantly fewer hands with the right pot odds where they can profitably continue.
### TOPIC: cbetting on high card boards in 3bet pots
We already talked about c-betting on low-card boards in 3-bet pots, and today we will use the PeakGTO solver to analyze the high-card boards in 3-bet pots.
We will cover different board textures on connected and dry boards to identify the differences and summarize key takeaways for each section.
In Position (IP) on Dry King-High Boards (e.g., K♠-8♥-4♦): These boards heavily favor the 3-bettor’s range. The solver recommends c-betting nearly 100% of the time, mixing bet sizes nearly exactly split between small and medium bets.In Position on Connected King-High Boards (e.g., K♠-9♦-7♦): You can still c-bet around 96% of the time. Stick mostly to small sizing (~⅓ pot), using larger bets occasionally with vulnerable value hands.Out of Position (OOP) on Dry King-High Boards (e.g., K♥-7♠-2♣): Despite being OOP, the solver favors a high c-bet frequency (~98%), mainly using larger sizing (~⅔ pot) to protect equity and deny realization.Out of Position on Connected Queen/Jack-High Boards (e.g., Q♥-8♠-7♠): These hit the caller’s range harder. Reduce c-betting to ~56% to mix in more checks. Strong hands still prefer larger bet sizes for value and protection.
We will start with an in-position example where we 3-bet from the button against a cutoff open, and he calls before the flop.
Key assumptions:
Let’s firstly look at a dry flop of Ks8h4d to see our strategy in this situation when CO checks to us.
This is one of the easiest spots you can find yourself in since you can c-bet your entire range because of a massive range advantage on these kinds of flops.
That being said, complexity arises from choosing the proper bet sizing, as the solver suggests splitting it almost entirely in half and mixing your strategy with all of your range.
The things slightly change on Q-high and J-high boards, but you still need to c-bet aggressively with close to 80% of your range.
What might look a bit surprising is that we also keep c-betting almost our entire range on connected K-high flops. Here is an example of Ks9d7d.
In this situation, the solver suggests betting 96% of the time and checking only 4% of the hands.
This time, you should clearly stick to a smaller bet sizing of around one-third of the pot in most situations when betting, only leaning to bigger bets some of the time with vulnerable holdings.
However, your poker strategy should change drastically on lower-connected boards of Q-high and J-high since these hit the callers range much better.
For example, on a flop of Qs8h7h, you should only be c-betting around 49% of the hands compared to betting almost all the time on king-high boards.
Key takeaways
Now, let’s look at hands when we are 3-betting out of position (OOP) and analyze a scenario where our opponent opens from the button, we 3-bet from the big blind, and he calls.
Key assumptions:
Let’s firstly analyze Kh7s2c to see our strategy on a dry high-card board.
As you can see, the solver suggests c-betting 98% of the time, even when we are out of position, meaning we will be continuing pretty much every time.
In this situation, you should mostly stick to a larger sizing, such as two-thirds of the pot, to discourage your opponent from continuing with speculative hands and protect your equity.
Just as with our previous examples, when being IP, you also c-bet less frequently out of position as the highest card gets lower. In this instance, your c-bet percentage drops to around 75%.
When discussing connected boards, let’s examine Ks8s7d.
With king-high boards being the most favorable flops to our range, we are c-betting around 80% of our hands and distributing bets fairly equally between our entire range.
As for sizing, we use smaller bets most often, but still bet on the bigger side one-third of the time. We choose larger sizing for some of our strongest hands, along with a few draws like gutshots.
This helps us balance out our poker ranges across both bet sizes and keeps us unexploitable, regardless of what our opponent does.
Contrary to king-high boards, other connected high-card flop variations do not favor our range. If we look at an example of Qh8s7s, you will see that now we are only betting 56% of the time.
Like before, a game theory optimal strategy means we are splitting our betting and checking frequencies fairly evenly throughout the range. That said, the strongest hands, such as overpairs and top pairs, prefer betting more often and sticking to a larger bet size.
In these spots, our opponent will have good board coverage, so betting too often can easily be exploited. A similar strategy can be applied to jack-high boards.
Key takeaways
### TOPIC: cbetting on low card boards in 3bet pots
We already covered what hands to c-bet in single raise pots both on low-card boards and ace-high flops, and now we will dive deeper into 3-bet pots.Today, we will use the PeakGTO solver to analyze strategy on low-card boards in 3-bet pots.
We will cover both dry and connected boards when tackling these situations to illustrate strategy differences, and will wrap it up with core takeaways for each situation.
In Position (IP) on Dry Boards (e.g., 9♠5♥2♣): C-Bet approximately 53% of the time and prefer larger bets around 70% of the pot. Focus on betting strong hands like overpairs and include bluffs to balance your range.In Position (IP) on Connected/Wet Boards (e.g., 8♥6♥4♦): C-Bet approximately 27% of the time and mix between 30% and 70% pot-sized bets. Employ a mixed strategy, checking most hands to control the pot and avoid being check-raised.Out of Position (OOP) on Dry Boards (e.g., 8♠6♦2♣): C-Bet approximately 49% of the time and use larger bets around 60% of the pot. Bet overpairs for value and include overcards with backdoor draws as bluffs; mix checking and betting with other hands.Out of Position (OOP) on Connected/Wet Boards (e.g., 8♥7♥5♠): C-Bet approximately 27% of the time and use larger bets around 60% of the pot. Bet strong hands and good draws; prefer checking with the majority of your range to control the pot size.
We will use an example of a wide poker range where our opponent opens from the cutoff, we 3-bet from the button, and he calls.
Key assumptions:
Let’s start with a dry flop and take an example of 9s5h2c to see how we should be playing this spot after 3-betting preflop.
Our opponent will be checking to the player who 3-bet preflop all the time, and we will be c-betting around 53% of the hands and checking around 47% of our range.
It is essential to note that we will stick to the big sizing of 70% of the pot in almost all cases, which makes our strategy much easier to follow.
As always, we will follow a mixed strategy when picking the actual hands. We will mostly c-bet strong holdings like overpairs that might lose equity with unfavourable runouts and add bluffs to balance it out.
The strategy for disconnected boards is fairly straightforward, but things change significantly on wet flops. Let’s look at a different example of 8d6d4d.
These are the flops where our c-betting frequency will be the lowest, at around 20% to 30%, since it clearly favors the callers’ range.
In this exact spot, the game theory optimal strategy suggests c-betting just 27% of the hands and checking with 73% of your holdings.
While you should still prefer larger bet sizing two-thirds of the time, we should now employ a mixed strategy, varying between 70% and 30% pot size bets.
The c-betting hands a spread almost equally between all holdings, meaning we will stick to a truly mixed strategy with pretty much all of our hands by checking them most of the time.
By checking back, we control the size of the pot and deny them the opportunity to check-raise us on dangerous textures, while still being able to extract value from our strongest hands on future streets.
Now let’s break down some examples when we are playing OOP. We will analyze a spot where our opponent opens from the button, we 3-bet from the big blind, and he calls.
Key assumptions:
Let’s firstly see how our strategy looks on a dry board of 8s6d2c.
The solver suggests betting around 49% of the hands and checking 51% of the time with a fairly even distribution between the hands. That said, we should be betting overpairs more often than other holdings and balance it out with some overcards containing runner-runner draws.
We are employing a fairly mixed poker strategy with the rest of the range by checking and betting the same hands at nearly equal frequencies.
As for sizing, we should mostly stick with the larger one and use a 60% pot size c-bet when we decide to continue our aggression after the flop.
Since wet flops featuring low cards are not ideal for the preflop 3-bettor, we will often check to control the pot size and avoid difficult spots. Let’s see an example of 8h7h5s.
We should be checking a lot OOP, and in this exact spot, we are only betting 27% of the hands and checking the rest.
The hands that we bet most often include overpairs and good runner-runner draws, but even in these cases only bet half of the time. With the rest of the hands, we are only c-betting some of the time and checking as our preferred play.
### TOPIC: cbetting on paired boards
Understanding optimal c-betting strategy is not an easy task, and this is exactly why we break it down by different board textures. We already covered GTO strategy for low-card boards and high-card situations, and today, as obviously we will dive deeper into c-betting on paired boards.
If you are wondering how often you should be betting or checking and how your strategy changes based on your position at the table, this article will answer all of your questions.
In Position (IP) on Ace-Ace-X Boards (e.g., A♠A♥6♦): Utilize a small bet sizing (~1/3 pot) and c-bet nearly 100% of the time. This approach leverages your range advantage and applies pressure on the big blind’s weaker holdings.In Position on High Pair Boards (e.g., K♠K♦7♣): C-bet approximately 85% of the time, favoring a small bet size. The increased connectivity and potential draws warrant a more cautious approach, often checking back stronger hands to control the pot size.In Position on Low Pair Boards (e.g., 5♠5♦9♣): C-bet around 80% of the time, primarily using a small bet size. The presence of potential draws necessitates a more conservative strategy, incorporating strong hands and bluffs without showdown value.Out of Position (OOP) on Ace-Ace-X Boards (e.g., A♠A♥6♦): Adopt a predominantly checking strategy, c-betting less than 15% of the time. This conservative approach acknowledges the positional disadvantage and the opponent’s potential to capitalize on aggression.Out of Position on High Pair Boards (e.g., K♠K♦7♣): C-bet approximately 70% of the time, favoring a small bet size. The increased connectivity and potential draws warrant a more cautious approach, often checking back stronger hands to control the pot size.Out of Position on Low Pair Boards (e.g., 5♠5♦9♣): C-bet around 65% of the time, primarily using a small bet size. The presence of potential draws necessitates a more conservative strategy, incorporating strong hands and bluffs without showdown value.
Our strategy for c-betting on paired boards relies heavily on the actual pair on the board, so we will break down different spots to see how it changes in various situations.
Key assumptions:
The most straightforward spot is when you have AAx on the flop since you need to bet small all of the time with close to 100% of your range. Let’s take the example of AsAh6d.
This is clearly a much better board for our range, so we can get away with betting all the time and sticking to a one-third pot size bet. Our range does not need much protection since there are no scare cards to come.
It is also worth mentioning that our poker strategy does not change much if we replace 6 with a face card or any other card, for that matter. You still need to bet pretty much your entire range in these situations.
As a rule of thumb, the lower the pair, the less often we will bet. If we have KKx or QQx boards, we then start checking around 10% of our range.
Our c-betting percentage drops further on boards like JJx, where we check around 20% of the time, and this moves further up to 30% on the TTx board.
As far as actual hands go, we always use a mixed strategy of checking and betting the same hands proportionally. In all these situations, you still want to keep using small bet sizing.
When the pairs get really low, the c-bet percentage drops even further. However, even on a low board texture such as 6s6h2c, you will be betting 60% of your range and mostly using small bet sizing.
Next, we will look at the adjustment we should make when being OOP and use these assumptions when analyzing the hands:
Let’s start with the same example we analyzed while being in position and see how our strategy changes on the AAx board when we have players to act after us. Let’s look into AhAs6d.
As you can see, our strategy changed almost to the opposite spectrum. Instead of betting 100% of the time, as in the previous example, we now have to check most of the hands and only bet around 17% of the time when we are OOP.
Whenever you bet, picking a small size is the preferred option.
The betting is distributed equally throughout the entire poker range, so you just follow the same pattern of mixed strategy, only checking some broadway combinations more often.
AAx boards are more of an exception compared to other high card pairs because button calling range preflop has a lot of Ax combinations. Therefore, our betting frequency increases on different boards. Let’s take a look at KsKh3c as an example.
In this spot, you need to bet 55% of the time and, in most cases, pick a big bet size of two-thirds of the bot.
Just like in the previous example, your betting strategy is distributed between the hands. That said, now you have all of the broadway holdings betting more often while pocket pairs and Ax hands check a bit more.
What is surprising in these situations is that on the boards of QQx and JJx, we are checking almost the entire range with over 90% frequency.
As the pairs get lower, your strategy will depend on whether the card next is higher or lower than the pair. For example, on 6c6dKs, you will bet around 70% of the time, while on 6d6h2s, you will bet two timeless less often, with only 35% frequency.
While these ranges will vary, we can see that game theory optimal strategy clearly prefers using bigger bet sizes in both of these spots. As a rule of thumb, you should be betting twice as often when the board favors your range.
Also, you should use a mixed strategy in all paired board situations. You should bet all of your hands some of the time and check the rest, only adjusting frequencies based on the board texture.
### TOPIC: check raising
Check raising is one of the most powerful plays in the game of poker. In fact, many live poker rooms used to ban check raising in the past, as it was considered unethical and almost a form of cheating.
Of course, today, it is clear that there is nothing wrong with check raising and that a check does not necessarily mean a weak hand.
The rise of online poker made check raising particularly popular, but many players never quite learned when and why they should check raise in their games.
In this article, we look at the main reasons to check raise and the ways to construct an effective check raising poker strategy you can use to crush your opponents and dominate your games.
As the name suggests, the check raise is a play made up of two parts: a check and a raise. You can only check raise when you are out of position and the player in position decides to bet.
Anytime you check out of position in poker and one of the players in position bets, you have a chance to check raise if you so choose.
While you can check raise anytime you face a bet out of position, building an effective check raising strategy can be quite tricky as there are many things to take into consideration.
If you are new to check raising, keep reading and learn why you should be using this powerful play in your games and how to choose the hands to check raise with for the best results.
The power of a check raise cannot be overstated, but many new poker players don’t quite understand when and why they should be check raising.
This leads to many players applying the play in situations that don’t warrant it, which can be quite costly.
Whenever you check the flop and face a bet from an IP player, you should only check raise for one of the following reasons:
Check raising for value is the most apparent reason to apply the play. Instead of betting out with your strongest hands, you can check to your opponent and use a raise to increase the size of the pot.
This play is especially useful in situations where you were not the last aggressor preflop, as your opponent is very likely to continuation bet in such situations.
When you flop a monster out of position, it is advisable not to bet into them but check your option first and raise after they c-bet.
If you were the last aggressor preflop, you should still check raise for value once in a while, especially on boards that, in theory, favor your opponent’s range.
For instance, if you 3-bet from the small blind and get a call, you should check raise for value when you make a big hand on a dynamic board that connects heavily with your opponent’s range.
For example, in a $1/2 online cash game, the Dealer raises to $6 off a $200 stack, you 3-bet to $24 with 8s8c, and the Dealer calls.
The flop is 9s8h6d. While you could c-bet your set, you should consider the fact that many of the hands in your range don’t have any connection with this board. On the other hand, your opponent’s range connects with this flop heavily.

By checking here, you represent a lot of hands like AK, AQ, or KQ that you may have 3-bet before the flop but may decide to give up on the flop.
Your opponent is reasonably likely to bet a lot of their hands, as they will have a lot of made hands and strong draws that will want to bet for protection.
In this spot, you can put in a big check raise and often get a call as your opponent gets stubborn with a draw or tries to pick off your bluffs with a hand like T9s.
Check raising is one of the most effective ways to bluff in poker, as it puts your opponent into a much more difficult situation than a bet would.
By check raising, you are representing a very strong range and saying you potentially have the nuts. At the same time, you are increasing the size of the bet significantly, and the implied threat of further bets on later streets makes it even more difficult for your opponent to call.
To be able to check raise as a bluff, you must be out of position to your opponent. Additionally, the board structure should be such that your range actually includes some powerful hands.
For example, in a $0.25/0.50 online cash game, you open from the cutoff to $1.50, and the button re-raises to $5. You call and go to a flop of Tc8s7c.
You check your option, the opponent c-bets for $3.20, and the action is on you. In this situation, your range includes many strong hands like J9s, TT, 88, and 77, making it an ideal spot to check raise with all these hands, but also some strong bluffs.
When choosing the hands to check raise bluff with, you want to look for hands that have a lot of equity in case your opponent continues, as well as those that make it less likely they will have the nuts or other strong hands.
In this particular spot, a hand like Ac9c would be the perfect check raising candidate, as it has a lot of equity against any holding while simultaneously blocking your opponent from having the J9 straight.
Similarly, 9c8c also offers the same open-ended straight draw + flush draw combination while also blocking the nuts.
It is worth noting that a weaker flush draw, such as 9c8c, will sometimes get you in trouble when the flush does hit, as you will be up against a higher flush and lose your whole stack.
In this situation, other flush and straight draws are the next check raise bluffing candidates, while hands that have a reasonable chance of being the best hand make very little sense to check raise.
For example, you don’t want to check raise a hand like JdTd on this board, as getting re-raised all-in would be a disaster with a hand that has so much equity but could also be well behind your opponent’s holding.
Instead, a hand like JdTd is best played as a call, as a call will keep all your opponent’s bluffs in the hand while also allowing you to improve to a straight, trips, or two pair on the turn.
Protection should not be your primary concern if you want to play good poker, but there are some situations where you do want to protect your hand by check raising the flop and deny your opponent equity by giving them improper pot odds to continue in the hand.
This is particularly the case on low and paired boards with hands that rate to be best but are incredibly vulnerable.
For example, imagine playing in a $800 poker tournament with a stack of 60 big blinds. You open the pot to 2.3bb from the early position with TsTd, the Cutoff re-raises to 6.9bb, and you call.
The flop comes 3s3d5c. You check, your opponent continues for 4.1bb, and the action is back on you with a decision to make.
Your pocket Tens will often be the best hand here, as the Cutoff’s 3-betting range contains many hands without connection with the board and are not overpairs.
In fact, there are only a handful of hands that your opponent could have to beat you on the flop if he did not have a big pair preflop, with A3s being one of them.
Your hand is very often the best hand for the time being, but many turn and river cards could give your opponent the best hand. What’s even more, if you call now and check the turn, your opponent could take a free card and see both the turn and the river for just $30.
Check raising your Sevens for protection in this spot makes a lot of sense, since your opponent is likely to fold a hand like AK or KJs that they took an aggressive line with before the flop.
Some more advanced players will continue with such hands as well, so picking who to check raise against in this situation can make a lot of difference.
Against most typical poker players, check raising here will work like a charm, as you will deny their substantial equity and take away their chances to blow you off your hand on later streets.
We reviewed the three main reasons to check raise in your games and explained how the play can extract value, make your opponents fold the best hand, and protect your hand in certain scenarios.
But check raising is an entire science of its own, with many different elements to consider each time you look to apply the play.
Before you go and play your next session, keep reading for our top five tips for effective check raising in Texas Hold’em Poker:
It can be very tempting to check raise on boards that favor your range regardless of your actual holding, but there are better ideas than this.
If you check raise on favorable boards regardless of the hand you have, you will end up with a very unbalanced check raising range that contains way more bluffs than it should.
Instead, build a check raising range from your strongest value hands and a number of bluffing hands that have plenty of equity if called.
If you have a hand that has very little equity, you should fold it regardless of the fact your opponent is likely bluffing.
Maintaining a balanced check raising range will make you extremely hard to play against and will not allow your opponent to exploit you by adjusting their c-betting and other frequencies.
The range of hands you should be check raising with changes significantly based on the opponent’s bet sizing, as different bet sizes represent different ranges.
A small flop bet often represents a very wide range of hands. On many boards, players will fire a small continuation bet with their entire range.
Facing a small range bet, you can get away with check raising a lot of hands, as the opponent is likely to fold a big chunk of their range, including some weak draws and other hands with equity.
In a situation like this, you should be looking to add hands to both the value and bluffing portions of your check raising range.
Hands like top pair and even middle pair with a good kicker can become candidates for a value check raise, while backdoor draws and overcards can become solid bluffing hands.
A strong check raising range is made up of more bluffs than value hands. In fact, the top players include about two bluffs for every value hand in their check raising poker range, and this strategy works like a charm.
Against sizable bets, you will only be looking to check raise for value with your strongest hands, and your play will look very strong.
Quite often, your opponents will fold their cards facing a check raise, which makes check raising as a bluff extremely efficient.
Of course, you don’t want to go too hard and bluff your entire range, but you should also make sure that your check raising range is not too value-heavy.
When constructing the range, try to keep a ratio of 2:1 and find two bluffing combos for every value combo you want to check raise.
A common mistake inexperienced players make when they apply the check raise is that they make the raise so small that it prices in the opponent’s entire range.
It is easy to get very excited about a big hand and look for ways to get your opponent to put more chips into the pot, but going for a small check raise is not the right approach.
For example, facing a $20 bet into a $50 pot, some players will check raise to $50 with the nuts in order to keep their opponent in the hand.
In a situation like that, the player needs to call $30 to win $150, which means they only need 20% equity in the hand to make the call profitable.
Not only is this raise not pricing out any reasonable draw, but it is also leaving you extremely exposed to losing your entire stack on later streets the times your opponent does hit.
Slow-playing is usually not the best course of action for several reasons when you find yourself with a big hand out of position. This is especially true when playing deep stacked like in cash game poker.
For one, if you check-call the flop with the nuts, you risk the turn going check-check, which means the pot will be very small by the river, and you will only get to put in one more small bet on the river.
Moreover, this course of action will expose you to all sorts of draws, allowing your opponent to realize their equity for free and potentially charge you heavily when they get there.
Not check raising the flop with the nuts also makes your entire check raising range imbalanced, as slow-playing monsters mean you are check raising way too many bluffs compared to value.
Instead, make sure always to check raise your strongest hands from OOP on the flop, as this balances your range, allows you to put all the money into the pot by the river, and charges your opponents if they want to keep drawing.
What is a check raise?
A check raise is a poker play that consists of two parts. The first part is checking your option out of position. The second part is raising once another player bets. The check raise is a very powerful play to apply when you find yourself OOP against an aggressive player.
When should I check raise in poker?
You can only check raise in poker when you are out of position. You should typically be looking to check raise on boards that favor your range over your opponent’s range with a mix of value and bluffing hands.
What is the goal of check raising?
By check raising the flop, you represent the strongest hands on a given board. Your range will be made up of value and bluffs, forcing your opponents to fold hands with equity while simultaneously getting value from their inferior value hands when you have a better hand.
What hands should I check raise with?
You should check raise with your strongest value hands and a combination of good bluffing hands. Strong hands like two pairs, sets, flushes, and straights, should be combined with hands like straight draws, flush draws, and backdoor draws.
How big should I check raise in poker?
The size of your check raise should depend on how wide your check raising range is. If you are raising with a very wide range, you should make your check raises smaller. If you are only check raising a narrow range, you should go as big as 5x the original bet (or bigger in very deep-stacked games).
### TOPIC: deep stack strategy
Poker is always a game of strategy, but the variety of plays available with a shallow stack is quite limited compared to advanced options with deeper stacks. While playing deep stack is mostly reserved for cash game players, the early stages of many tournaments also require players to play very deep, so you need to understand the basics no matter what your game is.
If you have learned how to play poker with shallower stacks and don’t feel very comfortable with more than 100 big blinds, you have come to the right place.
We are about to look at the most useful tips for deep stack poker play, which will help you make proper adjustments. But before we look into those, let’s try and understand the concept of deep stack poker in general and how it differs from more short-stacked play.
When playing with deep stacks (typically 100+ big blinds), the dynamics of the game shift significantly, requiring adjustments in strategy to maximize profitability and minimize risk.* Expand Your Preflop Range: Deep stacks increase implied odds, making speculative hands like suited connectors, small pairs, and suited aces more valuable. These hands have the potential to win large pots when they hit strong post-flop combinations.* Exercise Postflop Caution: With more chips behind, it’s essential to be cautious with hands like top pair or overpairs, as the potential for opponents to have stronger hands increases. Focus on pot control and avoid overcommitting with marginal holdings.* Leverage Position: Positional advantage becomes even more critical in deep stack scenarios. Playing in position allows for better control over the pot size and more informed decision-making throughout the hand.* Adjust Bet Sizing: Tailor your bet sizes to the depth of the stacks. Smaller bets can be effective for pot control, while larger bets can apply pressure and build pots when holding strong hands.* Be Mindful of Stack-Off Thresholds: The deeper the stacks, the stronger your hand needs to be to commit all your chips. Recognize situations where it’s appropriate to stack off and when to exercise restraint.Mastering deep stack strategy involves a balance between aggression and caution, leveraging position, and making informed decisions based on the depth of stacks.
Generally speaking, the term deep stack poker refers to playing with more than 100 big blinds.
Most commonly, deep stack poker is played at cash game tables. As players can buy in deep from the get-go, and the blinds don’t go up, most players at the table end up with a fairly big chip stack over time.
While the rules of play don’t change at all, many strategic implications come into play when the stacks get deep.
In deep stack games, you will see more post-flop play, fewer all-in confrontations, and quite a few difficult spots where the right play is not 100% clear.
For that reason, many of the best poker players like to play with deep stacks, as this allows them to exploit their opponent’s mistakes and capitalize on their strategic advantage.
If you want to learn how to adjust your play when sitting with a big stack, keep reading and find out the top 10 tips for playing deep stack poker.
One thing you will often notice in live cash games is that, as the stacks get bigger, some players start making bigger open raises.
It is not uncommon to see people raise it up to $20 in a $1/2 Texas Hold’em poker cash game when the stacks get deep, but this is not a strategy you should adopt.
In fact, there is no reason to change your raise size depending on stack sizes. Opening to 2.5x or 3x is fine, even with hundreds of big blinds in your stack, and adding a big blind per limper is also a good idea.
Keep in mind that, just like you would if the stacks were shallower, you want to raise bigger with your value hands if there are players at the table who seem to be playing many hands regardless of your raise size.
For instance, if there is a player who limp-calls any raise, you may want to raise 10x or more when they limp, and you have a hand like A-K, K-K, or pocket aces. On the other hand, it is important not to give too much up with your raise sizes and only make such adjustments in extreme cases.
Against most players and at most tables, you will want to raise to a normal size with your entire opening range and look to make adjustments to your 3-betting and 4-betting sizes.
While your open raise sizes remain the same, the hands you raise depends on your position. The preflop charts on PokerCoaching.com show what hands to raise from what positions.
Deeper stacks also mean bigger average wins and losses, which is why you should expect your variance to increase even if the stakes you are playing are somewhat the same as they were when you play with a shallow stack.
For instance, a player who always buys in for $1k in a $1/2 game will have bigger swings than the one who buys in for the minimum $100.
If you buy in deep and keep playing with a deep stack all night, you can expect to win and lose some massive pots, which will lead to significant variance.
A single turn of a card could cost you hundreds or even thousands of big blinds in some scenarios, which is why you will need a big bankroll if you want to play deep-stack poker.
However, keep in mind that bigger losses also mean bigger wins. Good deep-stack players generally do much better in poker games than great short-stackers.
Poker solvers are your friends if you plan on playing deep stack poker, and you should never forget that. Studying with solvers will make you a much better poker player.
While we strongly recommend using exploitative play in deep stack situations, knowing what the solver might do in certain spots will give you a great baseline to start from.
What’s even more, simply understanding why solvers do the things they do will make you a better player and allow you to see the game of poker in a new light that you have never seen it in before.
Studying hands and running them through solvers helps you become a better player.
When playing out of position in deep stack games, your 3-betting range should undergo the most changes.
Playing a polarized 3-betting range in the blinds, made up of the most valuable hands and a bunch of bluffs such as A-x hands and suited connectors will make you more difficult to play against.
By having a lot of bluffs in your 3-betting range, you will be able to 3-bet more against aggressive players and also have better board coverage when they do continue to a flop.
A hand like 7-6s will work better as a 3-bet from the small blind than a hand like A-To because the range that will continue against a 3-bet will be made up of hands that A-T plays worse against.
The bluffs in your 3-betting range will allow you to win many pots on the flop by representing hands like A-K or A-Q but also have disguised hands like two pairs, straights, and flushes on a variety of boards.
Remember not to take it too far with 3-betting OOP either, but take the opportunities you can, especially if the table tends to play soft against 3-bets.
It is critical that you maintain a polarized range when 3-betting out of position.
When playing with 50 big blinds, it is usually a no-brainer to pile the chips into the pot with a hand like pocket jacks or A-K, and most of the time, it is the right thing to do.
When sitting on a 250 big blind stack, or even deeper, you may want to avoid making such plays and add hands like J-J, Q-Q, and A-K to the range of hands with which you call 3-bets instead of 4-betting.
By just calling with these hands, you will allow yourself to have some very big hands post-flop while keeping your opponent’s range quite wide. At the same time, you will avoid getting into trouble against hands like K-K or A-A.
In fact, depending on your opponent’s aggressiveness, you will also want to just call a 3-bet with a hand like K-K or A-A yourself from time to time, making you extremely unpredictable and hard to play against in these situations.
Add a few A-x hands or random bluffs like 6-5s into your 4-betting range, and you will start playing like your favorite poker heroes you have seen playing in deep stack cash games on TV.
When deep stacked, you can add hands like 6-5 suited to your 4-bet bluffing range.
Playing deep stack games out of position can be extremely tricky, and there are quite a few times when you will want to play more defensively and control the size of the pot as much as possible.
Checking and calling will replace betting and raising on many different boards, and this is simply the way things must be.
For instance, when you flop one pair after 3-betting from the small blind, you definitely don’t want to force the issue and get 300 big blinds into the pot on the flop.
While you may still have a pretty good hand, chances are that if all the chips go into the pot, you will be drawing nearly dead.
By playing more defensively, both with your monsters and your medium-made hands, you will allow your opponents to bluff off their chips more often and generally play worse than they would if you took the aggressive approach.
One of the biggest mistakes recreational poker players make in deep stack poker games is that they stack off before the flop, holding hands like A-K, A-Q, or J-J.
While there are certain scenarios against some players where stacking off with such a hand preflop can make sense, most players will not put in a few hundred blinds before the flop without at least K-K.
What’s even worse, even if they do get it in with a hand like Q-Q or A-K, you will never have enough equity to justify going all-in in such scenarios, making it a bad idea to force the issue with hands like A-K, A-Q, or J-J.
In fact, such hands are ideal candidates to just call against opponent’s 3-bets, and almost always good calls against 4-bets as well.
However, 4-betting these hands will often get all the worse hands to fold, while 5-betting them against most players will also either lose you value or cost you your whole stack.
Be very careful with stacking off preflop in deep stack games, and try to avoid doing it without real monster hands unless you are facing an absolute maniac across the table.
Be wary of stacking off with hands like A-Q and J-J.
The value of implied odds increases in deep stack poker games, as you stand a chance to win more if you get lucky. Hands like straight draws and nut flush draw have a lot more value when the stacks are deep, as they open up possibilities to win some massive pots.
For example, if you are in a hand with the nut flush draw and you hit your gin card on the turn or river, there is a chance another player has a flush and may end up paying you in a big way.
The same goes for straight draws, which can make you a monster hand and get you paid big by flopped sets, two pairs, other strong hands, or even just very aggressive bluffs.
If you have ever watched the pros play in deep stack cash games, you have probably noticed them making some huge moves with big hands, such as nut flush draws and open-ended straight draws with overcards.
By playing your big draws as aggressively as you play your monster hands, you will get paid more often when you have a hand like an overpair or a set while also being able to exert maximum pressure and get more folds when you have just a draw.
If you are the kind of player who only ever makes big bets with a set, no one will ever pay you off when you do make those big bets.
On the other hand, if you mix your big bets between the two, you will get better results with both, winning big pots both when you make your draws and when people try to bluff catch against you, eventually turning you into a real deep stack machine.
When playing deep stacked, do not be afraid to get aggressive with your draws!
The position is always important in poker, but as the stacks get deeper, their importance grows even more.
Being in position means you can realize more equity and better control the size of the pot, both of which are extremely important factors in deep stack play.
While playing speculative hands on the button or cutoff can be quite profitable, the same hands fade in value when played from UTG or the blinds.
This does not mean you should fold hands like 9-8 suited in the small blind, but it does mean that you should be very careful when handling off-suit hands, gap-connectors, and other weaker hands out of position.
### TOPIC: defending bb on ace high boards
Since you have to defend your big blind a lot to avoid being exploited, you will end up playing a wide range of hands postflop that will put you in many tough spots.
To make things easier, we will cover both dry and connected boards, and by the end of this article, you will have a good understanding of how to play in these situations.
Dry Ace-High Boards (e.g., A♠9♥5♣) vs Small C-Bet (~1/3 pot): Call ~51% of the time with top pairs, middle pairs, ace-highs. Check-raise ~11% with strong top pairs (e.g., A9), two-pairs, sets, and some backdoor draws.Dry Ace-High Boards (e.g., A♠9♥5♣) vs Large C-Bet (~2/3 pot): Call ~43%, tightening up with fewer ace-highs. Check-raise ~5%, mostly with nutted hands and a few bluffs.Wet Ace-High Boards (e.g., A♥9♦8♦) vs Small C-Bet (~1/3 pot): Call ~50%, including more draws like 9x, 8x, flush draws. Check-raise ~12% with strong top pairs, combo draws, and bluffs like backdoor flushes.Wet Ace-High Boards (e.g., A♥9♦8♦) vs Large C-Bet (~2/3 pot): Call ~38%, focusing on high-equity hands (e.g., top pairs, good draws). Check-raise ~9% with value hands and high-equity semi-bluffs.
Today, we will use PeakGTO to analyze ace-high flop examples when you call from the BB vs BTN open and see a flop.
Key assumptions about the hand:
To start the discussion, let’s look at the poker hands we defend preflop to have a full understanding of how it correlates with ace-high boards.
As you can see, we 3-bet our strongest pairs and top broadway combinations and end up calling with 25% of the hands.
To break this down further, let’s take As9h5c as an example.
First and foremost, you should check your entire range from the BB. When we check and face a bet from the button, we will need to different around 62%.
For the most part, we will be just flatting with 51% of our total range, but we will have to incorporate some check-raises, which will equate to 11% in this situation.
Our calling range mostly concludes off hands with showdown equity, meaning we call with any pair. This includes even underpairs to the board, and we also mix in a few calls with our strongest hands, even though we will use them for check-raising for the most part.
As for check-raising, our range includes a mix of top hands such as two pairs and sets, and we balance it out with guthosts, weakest pairs, and runner-runner draws. This creates a great balance and lets us pick quite a lot of pots without going to the showdown.
Our strategy on connected boards is going to be fairly similar to dry ones. The biggest difference is that we end up defending fewer hands since we most likely will be facing a large c-bet size.
Key assumptions:
Let’s take the example of Ah9d8d. As mentioned above, your exact strategy will greatly depend on the sizing your opponent ends up using, but since he should pick the bigger one most of the time according GTO poker approach, we will build a response to that.
When facing a bigger bet sizing of around two-thirds of the pot, you need to defend less than 50% of the hands. In this exact situation, you call 38% of the hands, raise with a bit less than 10%, and fold 53% of the time.
Similarly to a dry board, you will be check-raising your sets and two pairs combinations alongside some gutshots and open ender straight draws. On top of that, you will mix some flush draws into your raising, but with a small frequency so as not to weaken your overall range.
Since you are facing a bigger sizing and raising fairly aggressively, you will need to call a bit less often than on a dry board because of MDF. You still call top pair and your second pair combinations, and also most of your flush draws. That said, now you can let go weakest third-pair hands and all of the underpairs to the board.
On connected flops, you will need to defend a bit less often when facing a bigger bet, so you can get away with folding more hands from your lower end of the range.
### TOPIC: defending bb on high card boards
We already covered the strategy for defending BB on ace-high boards, and today, we will dive deeper into high-card textures.
To build a comprehensive strategy for playing from the big blind versus a c-bet, we will analyze both connected and dry boards. By the end of this article, you will have a good understanding of how to adjust in these situations and how to construct perfect ranges.
Dry High-Card Boards (e.g., K♠8♥4♣) vs small c-bet (~1/3 pot): Call ~56% with all pairs, ace-highs, and some underpairs; check-raise ~17% with strong top pairs, sets, and select bluffs like gutshots and backdoor draws.Dry High-Card Boards (e.g., K♠8♥4♣) vs vs large c-bet (~2/3 pot): Call ~56% with similar hands; check-raise ~5% focusing on top-tier holdings and occasional bluffs.Connected/Wet High-Card Boards (e.g., Q♥9♥8♦) vs small c-bet (~1/3 pot): Call ~70% including top/middle pairs, some bottom pairs, and flush draws; check-raise ~13% with strong hands and combo draws.Connected/Wet High-Card Boards (e.g., Q♥9♥8♦) vs large c-bet (~2/3 pot): Call ~52% focusing on hands with solid equity; check-raise ~9% with top pairs, strong draws, and select bluffs.
Today, we will use PeakGTO to analyze high-card boards when you call from the BB vs BTN open and see a flop.
Key assumptions about the hand:
We call around 25% preflop against the button open while 3-betting our strongest broadways and pocket pairs, but still have quite a few Kx and Qx combinations helping us cover these high-card boards a bit better. This is how our preflop chart for calling looks:
To analyse this further, let’s take Ks8h4c as an example. In this spot, we check 100% of the time to the preflop aggressor and let the button take it from there.The tricky part here is that our GTO response quite significantly depends on the sizing our opponent uses for a c-bet, and since he should mostly go with a small bet of around one-third of the pot, we will start with this.
Versus a small c-bet, we are calling 56% of the time and check-raising 17% of the hands.
In this situation, we raise a lot of our value hands to build the pot and use a mixed strategy across the board, meaning we use the same hands for calling and raising with a different frequency.
This strategy lets us bluff quite a lot. Therefore, we can use our lower equity hands such as guthosts and runner runner draws to to put back the breasu to the BTN, who is going to be c-betting a very wide range in this situation.
As for our calling range, we will continue with pretty much all pairs including he underpairs and even A-high hands.
Things changes quite a bit against a bigger c-bet, where we need to defend less often because of the MDF concept.
The biggest difference when playing against big sizing, is that we will check-raise significantly less often and this will be only 5% of our range. While we still using mixed strategies in this situation, we will mostly do some raising with sets and two pair hands for value, mixing in vocational guthots and weak buttom pairs.
We call with a similar range as when facing a small c-bet putting out chips in the middle any pair and most of our Ax holdings.
Our strategy on connected boards is going to be fairly similar to dry ones. The biggest difference is that we end up defending fewer hands since we most likely will be facing a large c-bet size.
Key assumptions:
On connected board the BTN will mostly use big c-bet sizing against which we will have to defend a bit more than half of the time.
According to GTO strategy, we will need to call 43% of the time and raise around 9% of our poker hands.
Our calling range mostly consists of all top and middle pairs, some bottom pairs and flush draws. As for the raising portion, we do that with half of our a-high and k-high flushdraws, and some of the weaker draws alongside sets, two pairs, and open-enders.
Interesting enough, most of our strong and weak hands that we continue with has a mixed strategy.
When facing a smaller c-bet, our check-raising range increases to include more bottom pars with combo draws and additional guthosts. On top of that, our calling range increases quite a bit with some a-highs and even underpairs now become a defence.
### TOPIC: defending bb on low card boards
We recently covered the strategy for defending BB on ace-high flops and playing on high-card boards, and now we will analyse low-card textures.
In this article, we will analyze examples of both dry and connected flops and see what the best way to proceed in different situations is. After analyzing these examples, you should have a good idea of what hands you should fold, call, and raise on low-card flops.
Dry Low-Card Boards (e.g., 7♠5♦2♣) vs small c-bet (~1/3 pot): Call ~60% with middle pairs, bottom pairs, and some ace-highs; check-raise ~15% with strong top pairs, sets, and select bluffs like backdoor draws.Dry Low-Card Boards (e.g., 7♠5♦2♣) vs large c-bet (~2/3 pot): Call ~50% with stronger holdings; check-raise ~7% focusing on top-tier hands and occasional bluffs.Connected/Wet Low-Card Boards (e.g., 6♥5♥4♦) vs small c-bet (~1/3 pot): Call ~65% including pairs, straight draws, and some ace-highs; check-raise ~18% with strong hands and combo draws.Connected/Wet Low-Card Boards (e.g., 6♥5♥4♦) vs large c-bet (~2/3 pot): Call ~55% focusing on hands with solid equity; check-raise ~10% with top pairs, strong draws, and select bluffs.
We will use the PeakGTO solver to analyze low-card flop textures in situations where you call from the BB vs the BTN open and see a dry flop with all low cards.
Key assumptions about the hand:
To kick things off, it is worth checking our preflop calling range from the BB so we can build a comprehensive strategy on top of that. While we 3-bet most of our strongest hands like premium pocket pairs and top ace-high holdings, we still call a bit over 25% of the time.
Let’s take a look at an example of 9s5h2c and see how we should respond when facing a c-bet from the button. If you are facing a small c-bet, then you should defend quite a lot of hands based on MDF in poker.
To be more precise, you only fold around 26% of the time. In this situation, you need to call over 53% of hands and check-raise almost 21% of your holdings, which might look surprisingly high at first glance. To reach that, you need to add a lot of your top pairs to the raising range and put the pressure back on your opponent.
That being said, you will mostly face a large bet from the button according to GTO poker strategy, so let’s see how your defense range changes when facing a two-thirds pot size c-bet.
We need to continue with fewer hands when facing a large bet from our opponent, but we still need to defend almost 57% of our range.
In this situation, we are check raising almost two times less often but still have 11% of the hands, so our raising range is mostly compiled from our strongest hands and weakest draws. We are raising sets, two pairs, and our strongest top pairs for value and balancing it out with gutshots and bottom pairs with some runner-runner draw potential.
All other hands that have showdown value mostly go into our calling range, but we still fold lower ace-highs that do not have any additional equity.
You actually have a significant range advantage on low-connected boards in Texas Hold’em, so you will play a lot of hands after the flop, and we need to build proper ranges for that.
Key assumptions:
Your opponent on the BTN should only bet one-third of the time and use a small sizing of around 31% of the pot. In this spot, you will need to defend over 70% of the time, so let’s look at an example of 8h7h5d.
As you can see, we are check-raising around 20% of the time. While we use a mixed strategy for hands that we call and raise for the most part with no pure check-raises, we usually do some raising with sets, straights, guthost with overcards, openedners, and flush draws with a small frequency.
Your calling range should mostly consist of hands with good showdown value like top and middle pairs, some bottom pairs with overcards, and even underpairs. Combined with the strongest hands that you only raise some of the time, this makes your calling range unexploitable.
While you won’t be facing c-bet a lot since you have a significant range advantage, you still want to play quite aggressively when you do face a bet and put your opponent to the test.
### TOPIC: encountering donk betting
While No Limit Texas Hold’em allows players to make bets anytime the action is on them, the game follows a certain flow in most situations, with the preflop aggressor usually being the one making the bets on the flop as well.
Yet, this is not always the case, especially when playing against less experienced players who don’t necessarily understand the advantages of playing within the game flow.
What’s even more, there are times when acting out of game flow can make sense from a strategic point of view as well, especially if you are trying to exploit certain tendencies.
The move I am talking about is called a donk bet, and in this article, I am going to explain more about what a donk bet is, when players usually utilize it, and what you can do to deal with donk bets in your poker games.
The name “donk bet” comes from the word “donkey,” which is typically used to describe a bad poker player who doesn’t really understand any poker strategy.
A donk bet refers to a bet made on the flop by the player who took a passive line before the flop and is out of position.
For example, the player on the button makes a raise to 3x the big blind, and the player in the big blind makes the call.
The flop comes As9d4c, and the player in the big blind comes out betting for 5 big blinds instead of checking, which would be the typical play.
A donk bet goes against the natural flow of the hand, which typically allows the preflop raiser to continuation bet on the flop.
Donk betting is usually associated with poor poker players and seeing a player donk bet often can be a good sign that they are not a very strong opponent to play against.
But how exactly do you deal with donk bets in your games? Before we can look into that, let’s talk briefly about why donk betting is not a good idea in the first place.
If you have ever watched high-stakes poker games with strong players on TV, you have probably noticed that the player who defends preflop in the blinds almost always checks the flop.
There are plenty of reasons for that, as checking our entire range as the defender is very often what a GTO poker strategy prefers as it allows us to not reveal any information about our hand.
By making a bet on the flop, we give our opponent some information about our hand whether we want to or not, as it is nearly impossible to properly balance a donk betting range.
To be truly balanced, we would need to fire some donk bets with hands that have not connected with the board at all, and this is something most players don’t do.
Instead, most players who employ a donk betting strategy will fire flops when they flop a draw, or when they flop strong, or a combination of the two.
In either case, by donk betting the flop, we tell the player in position that we have a piece of the board, allowing them to proceed accordingly.
If we donk bet, the opponent can simply fold all the hands that have not connected with the board and that he could have otherwise c-bet with.
For example, imagine defending the big blind against a 3x raise from the button with As7c. The flop comes Ah7d3c. Instead of checking, you decide to fire out a 4bb bet.
Your opponent is now more or less forced to fold hands like KQ, JQ, JT, and many others that have not connected with this board at all while you are holding a monster.
On the other hand, had you checked, the opponent would be very likely to fire a c-bet, as the A-high flop favors their opening range.
Let’s take another example. You defend the big blind against the same player with 6s5s and the flop comes Jd4s3s. Once again, you fire out a 4bb donk bet on the flop.
Your opponent is once again forced to fold all sorts of hands that have not connected with the board, especially because you have alerted them that you have connected with the board.
On the other hand, your monster draw was strong enough for a check-raise, which would allow your opponent to fire with a hand like AK or KQ and then have to fold it to your raise, earning you an additional bet.
In most cases, a donk bet is an inferior play to a check, but let’s check out a few scenarios in which such a play can actually be the right way to go.
The problem with donk betting is that most players don’t use this play at the right time and instead try to make a donk bet when they don’t want to see the flop checked through.
A donk bet never makes sense on any A or K-high board, as such a board heavily favors the raiser’s range. The same can be said for boards with multiple Broadway cards.
On the other hand, low and middle connected boards can give you some space for a donk bet, but only with a well-crafted range.
Such a poker ranges would have to include a number of both value and bluffing hands merged into one single donk-betting range.
For instance, on a board of 6h5h3d, you would want to donk out with any number of single pairs, two pairs, sets, straights, and draws to balance the range out.
On the other hand, you could simply check all these hands and then play them accordingly, facing a c-bet or on the turn when the flop checks through.
One scenario in which donk betting makes a lot more sense is when the hand goes multi-way, and you flop a strong draw or a strong made hand in the blinds.
While donk betting in this situation does somewhat advertise your hand as strong, it also allows you to protect your poker equity and make your opponents pay for their draws.
By checking your nuts in a 4-way pot, you allow your opponents to check back and realize their equity for free, which is usually not a good idea.
So, if you are ever going to donk bet, do so in multi-way pots where your hand rates to be the best or your draw has a good chance of making the nuts if called.
Now that we have established you should stay away from donk betting for the most part, let’s talk about what to do when you face a donk bet yourself.
In most cases, the players donk betting into you will not be terribly advanced, which is why you get to play fairly straightforward against them.
The biggest exploit you can make when facing a donk bet against an unknown player is to let your hand go unless you are very strong on the flop.
For instance, if you raise AsKs, the flop comes 8d7c4c, and your opponent donk bets into you, letting the hand go could be a good plan.
On the other hand, it is also important to recognize that most players don’t donk bet their nutted hands either and will usually be donking with a draw or a relatively weak value hand.
If you happen to have a drawing hand yourself, a big raise on the flop can give them bad pot odds and often get your opponent to lay down their hand. The best part about this is that even when your opponent does call, that is still a great result for you as they are making a large mathematical error.
For instance, on the same board as above, you could easily make a big raise with AcQc and get your opponent to fold a hand like 8s5s quite often.
If you play with the same group of players often, you may be able to pick up on the tendencies of certain players to donk bet a lot of their medium-value hands.
Once you spot this, you can relentlessly raise against such donk bets and get the player to fold over and over to you for quite a while.
While this plan can occasionally backfire if the player catches up and traps you with a monster, you will win the pot outright much more often and compensate for the occasional loss.
A donk bet is a play usually utilized by inexperienced poker players or those who don’t understand poker strategy at a high level, and you can easily go your entire poker career without ever donk betting.
While the play can make some sense in multi-way pots, it is almost always the inferior choice in heads-up play and should be avoided.
If you find yourself facing a lot of donk bets from your opponents, make sure to keep a close eye out to figure out the range of hands they like to donk bet with.
Once you master this, you will be able to make extremely exploitative plays that will leave your opponents in the dust and allow you to completely dominate them.
As far as donk betting goes on your part, try to avoid this play for the most part and learn how to play out of position while checking your entire range on the vast majority of boards.
### TOPIC: ev explanation
Poker EV, or expected value, is one of the most commonly used terms in modern poker theory. When looking to make a difficult decision at the poker table, the best players out there look to EV to help them make the right choice.
You will often hear the online crushers say things like “that play prints EV,” but what does it all mean, and how exactly does expected value work in poker?
If you are wondering these things, you are in the right place. We are about to explain the concept of expected value, how to calculate it, and how to use it in real-world poker scenarios.
Expected Value (EV) is a fundamental concept in poker that represents the average amount a player can expect to win or lose from a particular decision over the long run. By consistently making decisions with positive EV, players can maximize their profits over time. Calculating EV involves assessing all possible outcomes of a decision, the probability of each outcome, and the associated gains or losses. The formula is:EV = (Probability of Winning × Amount Won) – (Probability of Losing × Amount Lost)For example, if you’re considering a $50 bluff into a $100 pot, and you estimate your opponent will fold 40% of the time:EV = (0.40 × $100) – (0.60 × $50) = $40 – $30 = +$10This indicates a positive expected value, making the bluff profitable in the long term.
Simply put, the expected value is the measurement of the expected result of a certain action.
However, the expected value does not necessarily translate into real value each time but rather only over a large number of attempts.
It is the average result you stand to gain from repeating the same action many times over with the same basic parameters.
Let’s take an example outside of Texas Hold’em to illustrate this. Things like coin tosses or rolls of the dice can be considered neutral EV situations, as there is exactly the same chance to flip each side or roll each number, and each outcome is typically worth the same.
However, in the example of board games, you are often asked to roll a certain number or higher on a dice, and this is where EV comes into play.
By calculating the number of sides that work in your favor and taking into account the reward you get for rolling right, you can calculate the exact value of each roll.
We will go into detailed EV calculations, which are quite simple, further in the text, but let’s put the expected value into the context of poker first and explain how EV works in the game.
Like poker, board games offer other unique examples of expected value.
While novice poker players often think about hands in terms of whether or not their draw is going to hit, all pros care about the expected value of their decisions.
In the long run, making decisions with positive EV (+EV) over decisions with negative EV (-EV) turns into a real profit.
A +EV decision yields a positive theoretical chip balance when all the factors are taken into consideration.
A very simple example of a +EV decision in poker would be holding 9-9 on a board of 9♠7♠3♣ in a cash game and your opponent going all-in. No matter what they have, and no matter how many chips are already in the pot, you will be the favorite to win this hand, and your call will be +EV.
It becomes a lot more complicated when, on the same board, you have a hand like 10-9, and your opponent plays it equally as aggressively, as now there are hands that beat you, as well as the many possible draws.
The current size of the pot and the value of the chips you still need to put into the pot all come into play as well, as the net chip result is all that matters, at least in cash games.
In tournament poker, on the other hand, many players will try to avoid slightly +EV situations in order to try and wait for a better situation instead of risking their tournament life on a virtual coin flip.
Winning poker tournaments sometimes requires you to shy away from +EV situations.
This brings us to the fun part of actually calculating our EV using a mathematical formula which always works the same way.
In order to be able to calculate expected value, we first need to have a good idea of our equity in the hand, and this is where things can get a little troubling.
In certain situations, it can be difficult to say whether our opponent is holding the nuts, a bluff, or a semi-bluff, and our equity against such hands can be wildly different.
For this reason, we must compare our current hand with the opponent’s entire perceived range of hands.
This can be a bit difficult to do in real-time, but with some experience and practice, you will learn to estimate your equity against an opponent’s range quite precisely.
Once you have an idea of your equity in hand, you will be able to use the following formula to determine your expected value:
EV = (%W * $W) – (%L *$L)
In this formula, %W and %L stand for the percentage of times you will win or lose, while $W and $L stand for the number of chips you can win or lose.
Note that the number of chips you can win is usually not the same as the number of chips you can lose, as there is usually some amount of chips in the pot before the current action.
Let’s take a look at an example of an actual hand and do some quick EV calculations.
Especially when playing at the biggest stages,you must be able to mentally calculate EV in poker hands.  (Photo courtesy of PokerGO)
Playing in a poker tournament, with blinds at 100/200 and a 200 ante, you are sitting on the dealer button with 28,000 chips in your stack.
You open the hand to 450 with Q♥J♥, the big blind re-raises to 1,800, you make the call, and you take it to the flop heads-up.
With 3,700 in the pot, the big blind c-bets for 2,500 on the flop of A♥K♦7♥, and it is time to do some calculations.
The first thing we need to figure out is how much equity we have against our opponent’s range.
Since this board significantly favors his range over ours, we can assume that we will bet almost all of his hands that he chose to 3-bet with.
This certainly contains all the big hands, like A-A, K-K, and A-K, and some bluffs, like suited connectors.
A quick look at the odds calculator tells us that against a hand like A-A or K-K, we have about 33% equity; against A-K, we have 40%; and against A-Q, we have 45%. So even when he has the best hands, we can still hit a flush or a gutshot and win.
It is also worth noting that there will be hands in our opponent’s range that have completely missed this board, and we are an even bigger favorite against them.
Let’s assume the 3-bet range of around 10%, including these holdings…
9-9+,A-Ts+,K-Qs,9-7s+,8-6s+,75-s+,6-5s,5-4s,A-Jo+,K-Qo
If he c-bets most of the hands, we have around 55% equity, so we will clearly have a positive EV.
For the sake of the argument, let’s assume he is a very tight player and will c-bet very few bluffs and mostly make hands like top-pair or better. Against that range, we would have around 42% equity.
Now, let’s do some calculations with the numbers we have:
EV = (42% * 6,200) – (58% * 2,500)
EV = 2,604 – 1,450
EV = 1,154
The formula clearly tells us that we will win 1,154 chips by simply making this call, even without ever bluffing with our strong draw.
In fact, this call would be profitable even with significantly less equity, as we would still be making some chips if we have 35% equity or less.
It is worth noting that expected value is not only used to calculate the value of your calls but also your bets and raises. In many situations in poker, you will be faced with a decision between calling with your hand or making a raise, whether for value or as a bluff.
In such situations, it is important to first figure out the EV of making a call. If it is negative or not positive enough, you may be able to increase it by raising it instead.
A raise with a drawing hand in some spots may result in your opponent folding a lot of their hands, significantly increasing the amount of chips you make every time you continue with the hand.
Since your goal in poker is always to maximize your chips won, always make sure to consider all your options and try to realize how it will affect your equity and your EV.
Furthermore, other considerations, such as implied odds, must also be considered when deciding on early street calls or raises.
For example, how much more value will you be able to extract if your draw gets there? Conversely, is there a high probability of your opponent having a stronger draw that will end up costing you greatly when you hit it?
You should consider all of these considerations when calculating the EV of your decisions, and you should remember to calculate for all of them before making up your mind.
When attempting bluffs, it is important you mind your body language and not give away any tells.
We already mentioned that EV only work in the long run and that it does not guarantee a positive outcome of any single event.
As you saw in the earlier example, our decision to call the flop was profitable from a mathematical perspective, but in some cases, it will cost us chips, namely when our draws don’t get there.
Of course, this will be negated by the times we do get there, and once we have played the same or similar situation many times, the variance will break in our favor.
However, it is important to understand that the long run in poker can take quite a while to realize, and there may be times when it seems like our +EV decisions are not working out.
This is NOT the time to go the other route and take the –EV route, as this is a sure way to make your results even worse both in the short and long term. Keep making +EV decisions and wait for the variance to even out.
Understanding EV in poker is critical to long-term profit.
Poker is a game of numbers, and it’s all about the long run and what you expect to win after making a certain play.
While you can’t control what card will roll off next, you can certainly control the situations in which you choose to put your chips on the line or fold your cards.
If you can train your mind to think in terms of expected value and always make the correct +EV plays you are able to, you will see this reflected in your final numbers without a doubt.
Next time you are facing a bet, stop for a second to calculate the EV of your potential plays and only act once you have completed such calculations. Your poker bankroll will thank you!
EV in poker stands for expected value. EV is a basic poker concept that evaluates how profitable a bet, call, or raise is in a given situation. By consistently making plays with positive EV, you will win money over the long run. On the other hand, if you consistently make negative EV decisions, you will lose money in the long run, regardless of any other factors.
In order to calculate EV in a poker hand, you will first need to determine what equity your hand has against your opponent’s range, and this will include a bit of guesswork. Once you figure out your opponent’s range and calculate the equity, you can use this formula to quickly calculate your EV: EV = (%W * $W) – (%L * $L).
The terms +EV and –EV stand for positive expected value and negative expected value, respectively. In poker content, these abbreviations are used to mark plays that have a positive or a negative expected value over the long run.
It is extremely hard to make the full EV calculation on the spot while playing the game. You would need to figure out your opponent’s whole range, calculate your hand’s equity against that range, and then run the EV calculation. This is why the formula is best suited for studying away from the tables, which allows you to make more educated plays the next time you sit down at the table.
In most cases, you will over realize your EV when playing in position and under realize when playing out of position. For example, if you make a flop call in position, you may be able to make more money in the long run than the pure EV of that call by playing the later streets well. When playing out of position, you may be forced to fold your cards on the turn or not get value on the river due to having to act first, decreasing the value of your hand.
### TOPIC: exploit calling station
Of all the player types you may find at poker tables, calling stations should definitely be your favorites, as they are both very profitable and very easy to play against.
In this guide, I will discuss all the different strategies you can employ to maximize your profits when facing a calling station. But before I do that, I need to explain what a calling station is and how to identify one in your games.
Calling stations are players who frequently call bets but rarely fold or raise, regardless of hand strength. They are common in low-stakes games and can be highly profitable opponents when approached with the right strategy.Key Strategies:* Value Bet Aggressively: Since calling stations are unlikely to fold, prioritize betting for value with strong hands. Avoid slow-playing; instead, bet to extract maximum value.* Minimize Bluffing: Bluffing is generally ineffective against calling stations, as they tend to call with a wide range of hands. Focus on value betting rather than trying to force folds.* Adjust Bet Sizing: Use larger bet sizes when holding strong hands to capitalize on their tendency to call. Conversely, avoid large bluffs, as they are unlikely to succeed.* Isolate the Calling Station: When possible, play pots heads-up against the calling station by raising pre-flop. This isolation allows you to exploit their weaknesses more effectively.* Be Cautious of Their Aggression: While calling stations are typically passive, if they suddenly show aggression, it’s often a sign of a strong hand. Proceed with caution in such scenarios.By implementing these strategies, you can effectively exploit calling stations and increase your profitability at the tables.
The term calling station gets floated around in poker quite a bit, but what is a calling station exactly, and how do you recognize one?
Well, quite simply put, a calling station is a player whose preferred play is always “call” as opposed to “fold” or “raise.”
Calling stations will check and call frequently while only betting or raising themselves when they have the actual nuts or are close to them.
Even when a calling station bets, it usually makes very small bets in the hopes of getting called instead of properly sizing its bets in relation to the pot, other players’ actions, and other factors.
Calling stations are often inexperienced poker players who don’t yet understand the game, although some players have spent their entire lives playing poker in the role of a calling station.
The exact reasoning behind playing this particular style of poker is unclear, but once you do find a calling station, you should do your best to play them as often as possible.
To summarize, you will recognize a calling station in your games by some of the following traits:
You will face calling stations more often at the low stakes.(Image courtesy of Poker Atlas)
When playing a hand with a calling station, you will often encounter very similar scenarios, which is why it’s good to have an idea of what to expect.
Before the flop, your typical calling station will usually start by limping in or calling a raise that someone else has made. A calling station will rarely enter the pot for a raise and will usually let someone else do all the aggression.
If you see a calling station making a raise before the flop, and especially going for a 3-bet, the alarm bells in your head should start going off immediately. The same goes for all the other betting rounds, where calling stations will only be seen making bets and raises when they hold a powerhouse.
On the other hand, you can fully expect to see a calling station call your and everyone else’s bets and raises with a wide range, from bottom pairs to backdoor draws and everything in between.
The loosest of calling stations will often call small bets in earlier betting rounds with just about anything, while some may end up folding bad hands that have no real chance of winning.
For the most part, a calling station that called a flop bet will call the turn bet as well, chasing after more cards that could help improve their hand.
Once you have identified a calling station, make sure to watch them play hands with others as well and try to determine just how loose they call bets and how far they are willing to go with their draws.
The more information you have on a player of this profile, the more value you will be able to draw from them in the long run, thus increasing your EV when this player is in the game.
If a calling station is all of a sudden 3-betting, it is likely best to fold your hand.
Now, let’s talk about some actual strategic adjustments you can make when playing against a calling station and the way you should execute them for maximum profit.
While playing the calling station heads-up would be ideal, in most cases, you will only get to play with such players in a ring game setting, which means there will be other players with differing play styles.
Assuming other players in the game are not all passive players, your job will be to isolate the calling station whenever possible but with hands that rate to do well against their calling range.
As previously mentioned, a calling station will often enter the pot with a limp. If you limp in as well, you will let other players join the pot cheap and take away big chunks of your equity.
A preflop raise, on the other hand, will often clear the field and allow you to go head-to-head with that player, which is the perfect scenario.
However, be mindful of other players still in hand and make sure to know which of them are capable of 3-betting your raises as a bluff and which ones are playing more straightforwardly.
When sizing up your isolation raises, make sure to go big enough to get other players to fold their weaker holdings, and don’t be too concerned about how much the station will call. In most cases, the raised size won’t matter to them!
Additionally, getting more money in the pot against a calling station should be good, as you are doing it with a range that’s made up of hands like 88+, suited Aces, and Broadway cards, all of which will be dominating and crushing the station’s limp-calling range.
One of the best ways to isolate a calling station is to 3-bet. Have you seen my video on how to 3-bet like a pro?
Once the preflop portion of the hand is over and you have managed to get a heads-up with the calling station, you will want to assess your hand against their range. Whenever you make a hand as strong as the top pair, and usually even with a hand like the middle pair, you will want to start betting for value.
Like I already said, calling stations don’t really care too much about your bet sizing, so you can get away with just about anything and bet big when you have a monster hand, while betting smaller when your hand is less valuable.
Remember that the calling station’s playing style is such that they will call bets with any pair, any gutshot, any flush draw, and basically any backdoor draw as well.
On draw-heavy boards, you should really make sure to bet big with your top pair or better, as you are extremely likely to get called by a hand that you are currently well ahead of. What’s even more, you don’t really need to be too worried about the station bluffing you off when a scare card comes on the turn or river.
For example, let’s imagine we raised to 4x preflop to isolate a calling station with KsQd and managed to get a heads-up with them.
On a board of QhTh7s, we bet 8bb into a 9.5bb pot, and the player calls.
The turn brings the 8h, which is potentially a very scary card. However, unlike many other opponents who might use this card to bluff us on the turn or river, the station will still just be looking to take a weak hand like Q5s or KT to showdown without any more bets.
For that reason, you will be able to make big bets and not worry too much about pot control against players from this category, which is exactly what makes them your favorites to play against.
Heads-up against calling stations, bet big for value as they will call with worse hands.
I wish I could tell you never to bluff a calling station, but there are some situations in which bluffing is still profitable, even against this type of player.
However, you should always look to bluff these players with hands that can get there in multiple ways on later streets while worrying less about things like blockers and removal effects.
Remember, the calling station is not very likely to fold to one bet if they have any piece of the board.
For that reason, a flop bet may get called, but a bigger bet on the turn or river may force the station to get rid of their weak hand if they are left unimproved.
The best part about it is that such players will usually let you know if they do improve by leading right into you when that two-pair completing card hits the turn or river. When they lead into you, you better believe them!
All that said, you should reduce your overall bluffing frequencies against a calling station by a significant portion across all board textures and make sure to bet for value a lot more often than you do as a bluff.
Since they will likely call, avoid attempting risky bluffs against calling stations.
The concept of an overbet used to be something people didn’t even consider in poker until relatively recently, but it’s one of the best tools you have at your disposal against calling stations. As I already said, the station does not really care about the size of the pot or the size of your bet in relation to the pot. They only care about the total dollar value being put into the pot and their hand.
So, if you flop a monster and want to get paid, don’t worry about the size of the pot and try to get as much value as possible.
For instance, imagine flopping a set of eights on a board of Qd7d8s in a pot that’s only $30 in your $2/5 game, as the station simply called your preflop raise in the big blind.
Sizing your flop bet up to $50 or even more is a great idea against this player, as they are just as likely to call this bet with a gutshot, an 8, or a 7 as they would be if you only bet $20. If they have a Q, they are calling pretty much no matter how much you bet.
What’s even more, your bet sizing won’t really impact the way they play later streets too much either, as they will try to improve on their hand and usually give up when they don’t.
The last thing you want to do is try to think back on what the GTO sim had to say about this particular board and make a “balanced” play, as the player you are up against isn’t really even thinking about what hand you might have at all.
Playing against calling stations can be incredibly fun and profitable in live poker games, but it can also be very frustrating. We have all seen “a fish on a heater” at one point or another, and sometimes, there is really nothing you can do to beat them on a given night.
You make your big bets, you get the money in good, and they simply keep sucking out on you all night long.
When this does happen, it is incredibly important to remember that poker is really not about the short-term results, that all luck is going to even out, and that this player has no chance of beating you in the long run.
Causing scenes when you get sucked out on, yelling at the calling station or calling them stupid, and worse yet, changing the way you play your game to deviate from winning poker strategy are the worst things you can do.
Instead, take any losses you endure in stride, take a walk and come back with a fresh head, and remember that there is no better situation to be in than playing against a massive calling station with a lot of chips in their stack.
### TOPIC: exploit lags
The loose-aggressive (LAG) poker playing style is one of the most complex in the game. Depending on how well one plays it, it can lead to great success or massive failure.
Many of the world’s best poker players play a LAG style with great success, while many of the world’s biggest losers can also be classified under the category of loose aggressive play.
It will be incredibly important to realize where exactly on that scale a particular player is and how well they are applying the LAG style in-game.
But before we can discuss how to adjust to playing against LAGs, let’s first understand what a loose, aggressive poker playing style entails and how to recognize players who play it at your table.
LAG players engage in many hands with aggressive betting, often applying pressure with a wide range of hands. Recognizing their tendencies is crucial for developing effective counter-strategies.Differentiate Between Good LAGs and Maniacs:* Good LAGs: These players balance their aggression with strategic play, making them challenging opponents. They mix bluffs with strong hands, requiring careful observation and adjustment. Consider slow-playing premium hands to induce bluffs and expand your 4-bet bluffing range to counter their aggression against Good LAGs.* Maniacs: These players exhibit uncontrolled aggression, often without strategic backing. They can be exploited by tightening your range and allowing them to overcommit with weaker hands. Focus on value betting with strong hands and avoid bluffing, as they are less likely to fold against maniacs.Leverage Positional Advantage: Playing in position against LAGs allows for better control over the pot and decision-making, making it easier to counter their aggressive tactics.Utilize Their Aggression: Allow LAGs to drive the action when you have strong hands. Their propensity to bet aggressively can be used against them by calling down with solid holdings.Exercise Patience: Facing LAGs can be frustrating, especially during downswings. Maintaining composure and sticking to a solid strategy is key to capitalizing on their mistakes over time.By understanding and adapting to the nuances of LAG play, you can turn their aggression into an advantage and improve your overall poker performance.
Unlike a tight aggressive player (TAG) or even NITs, who plays few hands very aggressively, a loose aggressive player (LAG) will play very aggressively with a much wider range of hands.
This starts with preflop hand selection, where an LAG will typically play a wider range than most players and continues throughout all betting streets.
Typically speaking, a LAG will raise and re-raise wide ranges before the flop and will continue to barrel whenever he catches any equity or when he feels weakness in his opponent.
The LAG approach is often so successful in poker because players generally don’t like to face big bets and will often fold too much, even to a player who is known for bluffing more than he should be.
When talking about these players, it is important to recognize the difference between good LAGs and bad LAGs, which can be quite massive at times.
A good player will balance his play by introducing a lot of bluffs into his range of cards but also will not go too wide and not bluff too often so as to make his range extremely weak across the board.
A bad LAG, on the other hand, keeps firing away anytime he gets a chance, very rarely folds to bets or raises, and plays like a complete maniac, usually to his own detriment.
While a strong LAG playing style can work out quite well and win big in the long run, a badly executed one is the fastest way to lose money in poker.
With that said, let’s take a look at some common strategies you can use when facing a LAG to protect yourself against good LAGs and print money against weaker ones.
Poker vlogger Brad Owen has made a career out of recording videos of himself exploiting LAGs in wild cash games.
Any poker strategy starts before the flop, with LAG players typically playing more hands than most other player types and playing them quite aggressively. A LAG will raise more, 3-bet more, and 4-bet more than your average opponent, which means you should be adjusting your ranges as well.
When faced with a thinking LAG who isn’t just throwing chips around like a maniac, your main adjustment should be to slow-play your strong hands more often and 4-bet bluff with a wider range.
Slow-playing your strong hands against a LAG 3-bet or 4-bet makes a lot of sense because his range includes more bluffs than it should, which means you are less likely to get action if you re-raise again.
At shallower stack depths, you will usually want to slow-play monsters like AA or KK, expecting to get him to keep firing at the pot with very little equity, often losing his entire stack.
The deeper you get, the more money you will want to put into the pot with your monsters, but slow-playing them once in a while will still make sense and put you into some amazing postflop situations.
When it comes to 4-bet bluffing, the logic is the same. Since your opponent is more likely to be bluff 3-betting, they are also more likely to fold to your 4-bet, which means expanding your 4-betting range will make sense.
Remember not to 4-bet hands like suited Broadways that you can easily profitably call against a player like this, and rather use small suited Aces or lower-suited connectors to expand your 4-bet bluffing range against LAGs.
Tom Dwan is one of the best poker players to use a LAG strategy.
The other type of LAG, which we often refer to as “maniac,” is a player who plays very aggressively on all betting streets but does not really understand equities, ranges, or poker in general.
Instead, this player type tries to win every pot and always continues to bet no matter what. In most cases, these are the big losers in any poker game.
When faced with a player like this, bluffing before the flop should be more or less out of the question, although you still don’t want to make your range too predictable.
For the most part, you will want to 3-bet, and 4-bet, a very strong range made up of value hands and only an occasional bluff, and you will want to make your raises big.
Remember, a maniac’s range is too wide in every spot, but he is very unlikely to fold to any raise you put in. Instead, he is more likely to come over the top once again.
Whenever you have a player who fits into the category of a maniac, remember to go for value any chance you get and strap in for a wild ride full of variance, big pots, and big winning sessions.
When playing in lively poker games (like the yearly PokerCoaching.com Meet-Up Game), be prepared to face some maniacs!
The importance of position in poker cannot be overstated in any situation, but it becomes that much greater when faced with LAG players in particular.
Sitting to the immediate left of a LAG, as opposed to sitting to his immediate right, can mean the difference between having an enjoyable night at a poker table versus living through a real poker nightmare.
By default, a LAG player will raise and re-raise tons of hands before the flop and will continue to barrel flops, turns, and rivers relentlessly.
By having a position on a LAG, you will get a chance to limit his options by flatting his raises, calling his flop bets, and generally not allowing him to put as much money into the pot as he would like to.
Playing out of position, on the other hand, you will often find yourself giving away information, missing value bets, and not realizing as much of your equity as you would want to.
If you have the option, always position yourself to the left of the most aggressive players at the table and to the right of TAGs and NITs, as this will put you in the best position to make money.
In tournament poker, where your seat is assigned to you, remember to adapt to your table and play tighter with LAGs to your left in order to make sure you are not getting pushed off your hand too often.
Make sure you know what position you are in when establishing preflop ranges.
By their nature, LAGs are more aggressive than an average poker player, and this means they will give you more opportunities to trap them.
While you should definitely not follow in the footsteps of Phil Hellmuth and think everyone is just waiting to punt their stack away into your trap, there are definitely situations in which slow-playing and trapping can work like a charm against LAGs.
We already talked about slow-playing monsters before the flop against LAGs, and the same logic continues across the board.
When you flop monsters against a LAG, you should often slow play, act like you are on a draw, and allow them to bomb turns and rivers with overbets, hoping to get you to fold your marginal holdings.
Remember, raising too early against a LAG doesn’t work very well with strong hands because their range is likely to be weak and loaded with bluffing hands that don’t have too much equity.
As always, going too far in either direction will make you exploitable as well, so make sure not to slow-play your monsters every single time. Raise more in situations when your strong hands are vulnerable, and the LAG is likely to have a hand they can continue with, and less on locked boards that make it unlikely for LAG to have much equity.
Do not be afraid to apply aggression when facing LAGs.
We talked a bit about how to play your very strong hands against LAGs, but what do you do when you have a good hand but not a great one?
The answer is to bluff catch a lot, and allow your opponent to keep barreling into you until the river. In some cases, you will have to close your eyes, make a big call, and hope for good news.
The worst part about playing against competent LAGs is that you will often face big bets that you simply have to call, and at times, this can look a bit silly to an innocent bystander.
Imagine playing in a $1/2 Texas Hold’em cash game with effective stacks of $500, a LAG sitting in the small blind, and you looking down at J♥T♥ in the cutoff.
You open to $6, the LAG 3-bets to $20, and you make the call, taking you to a flop of:
J♦5♦4♦
With $41 in the pot, the LAG fires a $30 c-bet, and you make the standard call, taking you to the turn, which is the Q♠, making the board:
J♦5♦4♦Q♠
You are faced with a $65 bet into $101. At this point, your opponent is representing a hand like AA, KK, AQ, QQ, JJ, or QJs, all of which are certainly possible.
However, since we are up against a LAG, there is also every chance he has a diamond draw, possibly combined with a wheel draw, as well as other hands like AT or 76s, which are simply barreling to get a fold from the exact kind of hand you have.
You make the call, and the river card comes down, completing the board:
J♦5♦4♦Q♠5♠
With every single draw having missed, and you holding no blockers to any of the draws, your opponent now bets $200 into the pot of $236, representing an absolute monster.
It is in spots like these, when facing a LAG, that you will have to make some tough calls. While they will end up having some big hands from time to time, on a board like this, a LAG will also be inclined to bluff a lot.
However, before making a play like this, make sure that you actually know your opponent and aren’t just guessing as to his likelihood to be bluffing, as that can be the difference between making the right call and just throwing your chips away.
There are days when you play against the wildest of LAGs and get absolutely destroyed as the deck keeps on hitting him, and there is seemingly nothing you can do to offset the variance.
Losses against a LAG can hurt a lot, as you are often forced to make plays that you would not make against calling stations, but you must remember that you are playing poker for the long run.
As with all things in poker, patience is key to playing against loose-aggressive players as well, as the right spots will come up, and the LAG will end up bluffing off his stack often enough to make you the winner.
### TOPIC: fold equity
There is more than one way to win a hand of poker, and while making the nuts is fun, seeing your opponent muck their cards when you are bluffing is an even better feeling. The ability to win hands by making our opponents fold their cards adds extra equity to our poker hands, called fold equity.
When properly calculated, this can be added to total equity to determine the EV of your hand in any particular situation in poker.
In this article, we will uncover the concept of fold equity, explain how it works and calculates it, and suggest ways you can apply it the next time you play.
Let’s start by explaining the concept in the most basic terms and looking at the easiest way to calculate fold equity.
Fold equity refers to the additional value you gain when your opponent folds in response to your bet or raise. It’s calculated by multiplying the likelihood of your opponent folding by the equity you would gain if they fold. For example, if there’s a 70% chance your opponent will fold and you would gain 30% equity from their fold, your fold equity is 21%.This concept is crucial when deciding to bluff or apply pressure, especially when you have a drawing hand or a marginal holding. By incorporating fold equity into your decision-making, you can increase your overall expected value (EV) in a hand.Additionally, understanding the risk-to-reward ratio helps determine how often your bluffs need to succeed to be profitable. For instance, if you bet half the pot, your bluff needs to work more than 33% of the time to break even.
In the most basic terms, fold equity is the extra equity we gain in hand by getting other players to fold their cards, allowing us to win the pot immediately.
Fold equity is based on the theoretical probability of our opponent folding and the size of the pot we are contesting. The more likely our opponent is to fold, the more fold equity we will have.
Utilizing fold equity is critical if you want to win in poker, as you can’t always rely on just making a better hand than your opponent.
In fact, it is likely that you have already used fold equity on some level when you played poker anytime you considered bluffing to try to get your opponent off his hand. That said, we are going to look into fold equity in a bit more detail and explain the concept from the mathematical side of things.
Often times inducing your opponent to fold is the only way to win the hand.
Whenever you play poker and are thinking of making a bet or a raise, the idea of fold equity should be considered.
As previously mentioned, fold equity is calculated by comparing the likelihood of getting your opponent to fold and the equity their hand has to win.
Both of these things can be difficult to determine in real-time, but you will need to make your best guess to calculate fold equity somewhat correctly.
In post-game analysis, you should be able to get an even better idea of which portions of their ranges your opponents will continue with and which they will fold to your aggressive action.
In either case, the simple formula to use to calculate fold equity is:
Fold Equity = Opponent’s Equity * Percentage of Folds
For example, if you find yourself in a spot where an opponent has 30% equity to win the hand but folds about 70% of all their hands to a raise, you will be able to use the formula to come up with the following:
Fold Equity = 70% * 30%
Fold Equity = 21%
Just like that, you have added an extra 21% of equity to your hand, allowing the opponent to win only in the few extreme cases where they make the call and actually win with their inferior hand.
We will demonstrate this further in a specific hand example, but before we do that, let us briefly consider what adding this extra fold equity did for our total equity.
Since total equity is the sum of our hand equity and fold equity, we can use the following formula:
Total Equity = Hand Equity + Fold Equity
In our example, that would mean:
Total Equity = 70% + 21%
Total Equity = 91%
We have gone from having just 70% equity to win the pot if we make the call to 91% equity if we make the raise, making it nearly a slam-dunk win for us.
Being able to focus and mentally calculate your fold equity when playing live poker is critical to your success.
A concept closely tied to fold equity that many poker players don’t know about is the risk-to-reward ratio, which tells us how often our bluffs need to work in order to be profitable. The opposite of MDF.
When bluffing with hands that can’t improve to win the pot, risk to reward ratio is the only thing to look at, as it determines whether your bet is going to make a profit or not.
The formula to determine risk to reward ratio is as follows:
Risk to Reward Ratio = [Bet Size / (Bet Size + Pot Size)] x 100
For example, let us imagine you are playing in a tournament and looking to bluff at a 10,000-chip pot with a 5,000-chip bet. We would run this calculation:
Risk to Reward Ratio = [5,000 / (5,000 + 10,000)] x 100
Risk to Reward Ratio = (5,000 / 15,000) x100
Risk to Reward Ratio = 0.33 x 100
Risk to Reward Ratio = 33%
According to our calculation, we will need our bluff to work 33% of the time or more in order to break even. Indeed, winning this pot one out of three times will make the bet not lose money.
If there is a chance we can win the pot even more often than that, our bet becomes obligatory, as it means we are printing equity by bluffing in this situation.
Getting just 33% of poker hands from our opponent’s entire range to fold is usually not too big of an ask, which is exactly why bluffing quite often is recommended in poker as a whole.
In this same scenario, if we imagine that our hand has some actual equity to win the pot, such as a gutshot straight draw or some overcards, the 33% of folds needed would go down even further, as we would now be winning the pot some of the times even when called.
Knowing your risk and reward is just one part of being a great bluffer. Learn the other components with this article from Jonathan Little.
Playing in a $2/5 Texas Hold’em cash game online, you are dealt K♣J♣ on the dealer button. The hijack raises to $15, you re-raise to $50, the blinds fold, and the hijack makes the call.
With $107 in the pot, you see a flop of A♣9♣4♦, giving you a flush draw. Your opponent checks and it is your time to act.
At this point, you know that you have at least about 35% equity in this hand from your nut-flush draw, but there is a lot more equity to be won here.
It is at this point that you must consider what percentage of your opponent’s range will fold if you fire out a c-bet.
Hands that contain an Ace, as well as 99 and 44, will all continue, as will remaining club draws and potentially some other pocket pairs.
Yet, quite a few hands in other suits that your opponent might have might fold, and hands like T9s or J9s will usually continue but may even fold some of the time.
For the purpose of this exercise, let us assume that your opponent will fold 50% of their hands if you fire out a 35% pot-size bet. This would give us the following fold equity:
Fold Equity = 65% * 50%
Fold Equity = 32.5%
By adding an extra 32.5% fold equity, we now have a total equity of:
Total Equity = 35% + 32.5%
Total Equity = 67.5%
Note that even if our opponent were to call with more than 50% of his entire range, we would still be adding equity to our hand by eliminating some of the card combinations in his range that may beat us by the river.
Now, let us take a look at this from the risk-to-reward ratio point of view and figure out how often our 35% bet ($37.45) needs to work to be profitable:
Risk to Reward Ratio = [37.45 / (37.45 + 107)] * 100
Risk to Reward Ratio = (37.45 / 144.45) * 100
Risk to Reward Ratio = 0.259 * 100
Risk to Reward Ratio = 26%
According to this equation, our small bet needs to elicit a fold only 26% of the time to be directly profitable. Considering all the equity we still have to win the hand and the fact we are assuming our opponent may fold even more than that, this makes it an easy choice.
Of course, this is a clear-cut example of where we should bluff, but you can use the same formulas and calculations to figure out your fold equity in other spots as well.
By always being mindful of your fold equity and risk to reward ratio, you will always be finding good spots to bluff at and increasing your overall equity and eventually your bankroll.
Before putting your whole stack at risk with a big bluff, consider how much fold equity you have!
Bluffing or not bluffing enough is one of the big differences between losing and winning players and one of the main improvements most players need in their game.
Being mindful of the fold equity you can generate with your bets and raises can make a big difference in your win rate and turn you from a break-even player to a big winner.
The next time you are considering just calling with your draw, run some quick calculations, think about how often your bluff needs to work to be profitable, and consider raising instead.
### TOPIC: gto explained
Over the last couple of years, GTO Poker, which stands for “game theory optimal,” has become one of the most popular terms in the game.
Those who understand the fundamentals of poker GTO play often mistake that for being able to play a game theory optimal poker strategy, which isn’t true in most cases.
In this article, we will try to explain the concept of GTO poker in a way that can be understood by most poker players. We will also discuss the differences between GTO poker and exploitative play and provide examples of what makes each strategy better than the other.
Game Theory Optimal (GTO) poker is a mathematical strategy aimed at making your play unexploitable by opponents. It involves making decisions at optimal frequencies, ensuring profitability or break-even outcomes regardless of opponents’ actions. While solving poker completely is impossible due to its complexity, GTO provides a baseline strategy that guarantees you won’t lose money in the long run against any opponent. Players use GTO not to play robotically, but to build a solid foundation, then adjust based on exploitative reads. Tools like poker solvers help players understand these optimal decisions and refine their strategies over time.
GTO Poker (game theory optimal poker) is a style of poker-based entirely on mathematics, designed to make your plays unexploitable.
Playing a GTO strategy means making different moves at the right frequencies to always make them profitable, or at least break even, regardless of your opponents’ actions.
When faced with another perfect GTO player, the GTO strategy would break even. In all other cases, the GTO strategy would make a profit.
However, a complete GTO poker strategy has not yet been discovered, as there are too many variables in the game of poker to create such a strategy.
What’s even more, it is entirely impossible for humans to play GTO poker in real-time without using the assistance of computers, which is why an approximation of a GTO strategy is the best we can do.
Yet, studying poker with Solvers (a GTO poker simulation tool) is one of the best ways to learn how to play and how to think about the game in terms of ranges, frequencies, and balance.
One of the best poker players in the world under the age of 30, PokerCoaching.com coach Justin Saliba has built a career off of playing a GTO poker strategy.
As we just explained, GTO poker focuses on making our game unexploitable and making sure that we are perfectly balanced at all times.
Exploitative poker, on the other hand, focuses on exploiting our opponents’ mistakes, thus unbalancing our ranges at the expense of capitalizing on others’ mistakes.
While exploitative play stands to gain more when big leaks are spotted in our opponent’s game, it also stands to make us exploitable and crushed if our opponents can spot our leaks.
By using an approximation of a GTO poker strategy, we can always play poker the same way and continue to print money, especially in heads-up poker situations.
On the other hand, when faced with a particularly weak opposition, switching to an exploitative style of poker will usually result in a higher win rate, provided we don’t make big mistakes that will cost us dearly in return.
While old school legends like Phil Hellmuth built careers off of playing exploitative poker, in the modern era GTO is needed to beat the best.
Before you can really start exploring the world of GTO poker, you will need to learn about poker solvers and their use. Simply put, poker solvers are tools used to simulate the GTO poker strategy, with the likes of PioSolver and PokerSnowie being some of the most popular tools of this sort.
Poker solvers are able to calculate the exact way in which you should play the different hands in your range based on a variety of inputs you provide them with.
For example, if you provide a poker solver with your starting hands range, the pre-flop action, and stack sizes of the players involved in the pot, as well as the flop that was dealt out, it will provide you with a full rundown of all the hands with which you should check or make bets of different sizes.
You can view poker solvers as training tools that will help you understand GTO poker strategy more profoundly and eventually lead you to start instinctively making plays that resemble Game Theory Optimal way.
That said, it is important to note that the use of poker solvers while playing poker is forbidden in both online poker and live games and that these tools only exist to help you study the game while away from the tables.
Unlike an exploitative poker strategy, which is often employed by “old school” poker players, the GTO strategy deals with slightly different concepts.
To be able to explore poker GTO play further, you will need to understand a few basic GTO poker terms, such as hand ranges, frequencies, and minimum defense frequency.
So, let’s explain those briefly so you can begin investigating GTO poker more deeply.
The concept of hand ranges in poker has become very standardized these days and is used by both GTO and exploitative poker players.
A hand range is a collection of all poker hands that you or your opponent can have in a given situation when all previous action is taken into consideration.
Poker solvers can be used to determine optimal preflop hand ranges for various stack depths and positions. This hand range is then shrunk down with each new action.
Whenever you analyze poker hands with a solver, you will always be presented with solutions as to what to do with different parts of your range.
As you adopt the strategy, you will learn to always think about both your and your opponent’s hands in terms of ranges rather than two specific cards.
Preflop charts like the one shown above can help you play a proper GTO strategy.
While most novice poker players think about making certain plays in terms of either making them or not, poker solvers “think” differently and often present you with a mixed strategy that is made up of distinct actions, each to be made at a different frequency.
For instance, facing a preflop re-raise, the solver might suggest that you fold your hand 70% of the time and 4-bet it the remaining 30% of the time.
While this may seem counterintuitive, especially when the call option is not even mentioned, there is a method to this line of thinking.
The solver may decide to incorporate a hand that is not worth making a call with into your bluffing range at a certain frequency, all in order to remain balanced and unexploitable.
The truth is that thinking about poker plays in terms of frequencies will take a lot of getting used to, and only working with solvers for an extended period of time will help you actually get there in full.
One of the most commonly heard but also most commonly misunderstood GTO poker concepts is minimum defense frequency (MDF).
MDF refers to the minimum percentage of hands in your hand range that you should continue with (by either calling or raising) when facing a bet from your opponent.
Calculating MDF is fairly simple in theory, although coming up with the exact portion of your range you should continue while playing is too big of a challenge in most situations. Yet, working with MDF calculations while studying poker will help you quickly come up with close approximations while playing, helping you make the right decisions at the table.
Minimum defense frequency is calculated using this simple formula:
MDF = Pot Size / (Pot Size + Bet Size)
While you can calculate the MDF using this formula, you can also use the table below to quickly figure out what percentage of your hands you should continue with facing some standard bet sizes:
Once you have calculated the percentage of hands you should continue with, the real trick is to determine which hands to fold and which to continue with.
Solvers do an excellent job of identifying the perfect hands to call and raise with, based on backdoor equity, your ability to continue bluffing on the turn, as well as blockers and unblockers.
You will learn more about all these concepts as you study solver outputs, with every new hand you analyze teaching you the logic behind the GTO poker strategy.
Playing GTO poker is all about finding balance in every possible situation, which means finding hands to bluff with and to value bet within your range on every board.
This can be extremely difficult to do in Texas Hold’em, as our instincts often tell us that certain boards are not great to bluff at or that we should check out value hands more often than we really should.
Thankfully, solvers are there to help us shed these fears and make the right decisions, which is why studying different board textures with solvers is so important.
Remember that solvers will always look to find balance by finding the right hands to bluff and the equivalent number of hands to value bet with, depending on the bet sizes you instruct it to use.
Players who strive to mimic solver strategies always talk about balancing their range, and while it may seem like they are taking it too far, there is certainly good logic behind their thinking.
Tools like the FREE Range Analyzer on PokerCoaching.com can help you better study poker ranges.
There is much debate these days about whether GTO poker is the way to go or if exploitative poker strategy still reigns supreme.
The truth is that there are times when poker GTO strategy is the best, as your opponents are simply too good, and playing exploitatively against them leaves you very vulnerable to being exploited yourself. You should apply the GTO strategy when:
On the other hand, playing against weaker opposition, exploitative plays often result in higher gains and better net results, making an exploitative strategy superior.
At the end of the day, whichever way you choose to go in a given game, understanding the GTO baselines will allow you to make better exploitative deviations and will allow you to play against just about anyone without being run over.
Despite GTO poker being one of the most thrown-around terms these days, it is important to remember that humans can’t really play the GTO strategy to perfection and that everything you have ever seen employed in-game was just an approximation at best.
Yet, studying poker using GTO-based solvers will allow you to start looking at the game from a different perspective and build strong fundamentals that will make you extremely difficult to beat. Whether you are looking to play against the very best players out there or dominate your local home game, exploring the world of GTO poker will help you become a better player and compete at a higher level.
Start your poker journey today by going over basic poker tournament strategy and cash game tips, and then fire up the solver and run your first-hand analysis to see just how deep the rabbit hole really goes.
In poker, GTO is an acronym for “game theory optimal.” GTO is a poker strategy that aims for perfect balance, mixing different betting options and sizes in all situations and creating hand ranges that are unexploitable. Instead of looking to exploit your opponent’s mistakes, the GTO poker strategy aims to make your play unexploitable and is designed to do well against any opponent you may face.
A GTO poker strategy is a poker strategy designed for perfect balance. By playing balanced ranges across all betting streets, the GTO poker strategy becomes unexploitable. The main aim of the GTO poker strategy is to deny other players any opportunity to exploit your play and continue making profitable plays regardless of how your opponents respond to them.
A poker range is a collection of hands that a player can have in a given situation, given their play. Thinking about poker in terms of hand ranges allows you to more accurately assess the holdings of other players without making wild guesses. A poker range can be narrowed with every play a player makes, helping you pinpoint your opponent’s holdings more accurately.
A poker solver is a piece of software designed to “solve” poker. Poker solvers provide outputs, called “solves” based on the inputs provided by the user, which include player positions, stack sizes, and previous action. The solver analyzes the inputs and provides GTO poker solutions, instructing the player on optimal ways to play their entire range of hands.
In theory, GTO poker cannot be beaten. A player who would perfectly copy the GTO solutions would at least break even against any other player over the long run. GTO poker solutions are designed to be perfectly balanced and unexploitable. While they don’t always extract maximum value from every hand in every situation, they do protect the player from being exploited, making the strategy theoretically unbeatable.
No! A GTO poker strategy is designed to be perfectly balanced and unexploitable, which means you will not be able to exploit this strategy regardless of how you play against it. The best way to play against GTO poker is by playing GTO yourself, which would provide a break-even result in the long run.
This depends heavily on the situation. An exploitable poker strategy can, in theory, provide a lot more value for the player than a GTO poker strategy. However, employing an exploitative strategy also makes you exploitable, which good poker players will use to their advantage. Playing exploitatively against weak opponents can show great results, while GTO poker is usually the best way to go against good and studied opponents.
### TOPIC: gto preflop strategy
Preflop play is arguably the most critical aspect of No Limit Texas Hold’em. It sets the tone for the entire hand and lays the groundwork for postflop decisions.
Game Theory Optimal (GTO) poker provides a framework that ensures players will, at worst, break even against perfect play and, at best, win against any deviations by their opponents. This strategy uses mathematical models to determine the best plays based on ranges and probabilities rather than relying solely on reads or instincts. By adhering to GTO principles from the outset, you minimize mistakes and maximize your overall profitability at the tables.
Preflop play in Texas Hold’em is about setting the stage for the entire hand. Adopting a GTO strategy at this stage helps you make choices that are optimized, providing a solid foundation for the complex decisions that follow on later betting streets.
Balance is a cornerstone of GTO poker strategy. It involves playing a range of hands that keeps your opponents guessing and prevents them from exploiting your tendencies.
For instance, if you only raise with very strong hands, observant opponents will quickly adjust by folding more often, denying you the opportunity to maximize your wins. Conversely, playing too many hands can make you vulnerable to opponents who play a tighter, more aggressive style.
GTO teaches you to find a middle ground, using a balanced range that includes both strong holdings and hands that can develop into strong combinations postflop.
A poker range is the spectrum of hands you or your opponents might hold in a given situation. GTO strategies don’t focus on individual hands but rather on ranges. This is crucial because you often won’t know exactly what hand your opponent holds, but you can make educated guesses based on their actions and tendencies. Preflop, your range decisions will depend on your position at the table, the action that has occurred before you, and your understanding of your opponents’ ranges.
A GTO strategy aims to play a style that cannot be easily exploited. This doesn’t mean you will win every hand, but rather that your opponents cannot consistently make profitable adjustments to counteract your strategy. For example, if you perfectly balance your range of hands that you raise with, call with, and fold, you make it extremely difficult for opponents to predict your holdings and make optimal decisions against you.
Choosing the right hands to open sets the stage for the subsequent betting rounds. An optimal opening range considers both the strength of your hand and your position. Opening with too wide a range can leave you vulnerable postflop, especially in unfavorable positions, while being too tight can make you predictable and easy to play against.
Deep stacked GTO opening ranges are designed to be balanced and difficult for opponents to exploit. They vary significantly depending on your position at the table:
3-betting preflop is a powerful move that can significantly impact the dynamics of the hand. A well-calibrated 3-betting strategy is essential for keeping your table mates off balance, protecting your ranges, and putting pressure on your opponents.
3-betting allows you to capitalize on strong hands and exert control over the pot size, making it more costly for opponents to see flops and play speculative hands. It also serves to isolate weaker players and take advantage of positional benefits. When used effectively, 3-betting can generate immediate profit through folds and create advantageous postflop situations.
When constructing a 3-betting strategy, you can choose between a polarized range and a merged range:
Your poker table position is crucial when deciding to 3-bet. Being in position postflop gives you more information and control, allowing for more profitable decision-making. Consequently, your 3-betting range can be wider when you’re in a position to act last postflop.
Incorporating a nuanced 3-betting strategy into your game can significantly enhance your effectiveness in controlling the pot and navigating the preflop action. By understanding when to use polarized versus merged ranges and how to adjust your approach based on position and opponent behavior, you’ll become a more formidable and unpredictable opponent at the poker table.
The ideal 3-bet range varies based on your position and the opener’s position. Here are some examples illustrating GTO 3-bet ranges from different positions:
In No Limit Texas Hold’em, defending against raises is a critical aspect of a robust preflop strategy. Properly defending ensures you are not easily exploited by aggressive players and helps maintain a balanced approach to your game. A strong defense strategy involves a mix of calling and 3-betting, which should be adjusted based on the raiser’s position and tendencies.
The big blind typically has better pot odds for calling due to already having one big blind invested in the pot, allowing for a wider defending range compared to the calling ranges of other positions.
Having a strong, theoretically sound preflop understanding is imperative for any profitable cash game strategy. By focusing on formulating balanced and robust opening ranges, employing strategic 3-betting, and effectively defending against raises, you set up a strong start, maintain unpredictability, and maximize your potential at the poker table.
As you continue your poker journey, remember that mastering these strategies is just the beginning. Each game is a new opportunity for growth and adaptation. Keep studying, practicing, and adjusting your play based on the dynamics at the table. With dedication and persistent refinement of your skills, you’re well on your way to becoming a formidable player in the competitive realm of cash games.
### TOPIC: gto vs exploitative poker
In the world of No Limit Texas Hold’em, success requires more than just understanding the rules of the game. It demands the ability to navigate an ever-shifting strategic landscape. Two of the most pivotal approaches to poker strategy are Game Theory Optimal (GTO) play and exploitative play.
Both have their strengths, but understanding when to use each is key to unlocking your potential as a player. In this blog, we’ll explore these strategies, discuss how to identify opportunities for exploitation, and offer practical advice for balancing the two.
Game Theory Optimal poker represents a mathematically perfect approach to the game. It ensures that your strategy is unexploitable, meaning that no opponent can consistently counter it for a profit. GTO poker focuses on balance, constructing ranges that mix strong hands, medium-strength hands, and bluffs in a way that prevents opponents from finding patterns in your play.
For example, if you only bet with strong hands, skilled opponents will fold their weaker holdings and reduce your profits. Conversely, if you bluff too often, they’ll call you down more frequently, exploiting your over-aggression. A GTO approach eliminates these vulnerabilities by ensuring your actions remain balanced and unpredictable.
GTO is most effective in the following scenarios:
Exploitative poker is the art of adjusting your strategy to capitalize on the mistakes and tendencies of your opponents. Unlike GTO, which focuses on balance, exploitative play deliberately deviates from optimal lines to maximize short-term profit against specific players.
For example, if you notice an opponent who is just learning how to play poker and calls too often against continuation bets (c-bets) regardless of the size, you can exploit this by increasing your c-bet size when you have a strong hand. Similarly, against an opponent who overcalls with weak hands, you can value bet more aggressively with a wider range of hands.
Exploitation starts with keen observation. Here are some signs to look for:
By identifying these patterns, you can tailor your strategy to exploit their specific weaknesses.
The overall table dynamic can also influence your poker strategy. For instance:
Exploitative play isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. It thrives in specific situations where opponent tendencies are apparent. Here are a few examples:
Passive players are often reluctant to bet or raise unless they hold strong hands. Exploit them by:
Overly aggressive players can be a goldmine for exploitation. Take advantage by:
Predictable players are easy to read and exploit. For example:
The best poker players are those who can fluidly shift between GTO and exploitative strategies. Start by defaulting to a GTO approach, which keeps you balanced and unexploitable. As you gather information about your opponents, adapt your strategy to exploit their weaknesses.
Consider the following hand:
This ability to adjust based on opponent tendencies is what separates good players from great ones.
Conclusion
The debate between GTO and exploitative poker is not about which is superior but about understanding when to apply each approach. GTO provides a robust foundation, ensuring you’re unexploitable in competitive environments. Exploitative play, on the other hand, allows you to capitalize on the mistakes and tendencies of specific opponents for higher short-term profits.
Ultimately, the most successful players master the art of balance. By starting with a GTO framework and making exploitative adjustments as opportunities arise, you’ll maximize your edge and become a formidable force at the poker table.
Remember, poker is a dynamic game that rewards adaptability. Keep studying, observing, and refining your strategy to stay ahead of the competition. Whether you’re playing for fun or grinding for profit, the key to success lies in your ability to think critically and adjust on the fly.
### TOPIC: gutshots in poker
Gutshot straight draws, also known as inside straight draws, are among the least valuable drawing hands in poker. Yet, they are also a lot more common than other draws and are high in the poker hand rankings when you do hit your card, making it imperative to know how to play them the best way possible.
Just because a gutshot straight draw isn’t as likely to hit as an open-ended straight draw or a flush draw does not mean the hand can’t be made profitable in certain situations.
Before you can learn how to play your gutshot straight draws the best way, let’s take a step back and learn more about what a gutshot straight draw is and what the difference is between a good and a bad gutshot straight draw.
The first thing we need to do is teach you what a gutshot straight draw is in poker. If you already know this part, you can skip to further sections, although reading this part won’t hurt either.
In essence, anytime you have a hand that needs one particular card rank to come to complete your straight, you have a gutshot straight draw.
For example, on a board of Ks3d4c, holding 6s7s gives you a guthost straight draw, as any 5 on the turn or river makes you a straight.
Similarly, on a board of QcJdTs, holding Ah7h gives you a gutshot straight draw, as hitting any King would make you a straight.
This kind of draw is much weaker than an open-ended straight draw that can be completed on both ends, such as holding 6s5s on the Ks3d4c board, where any 2 or 7 would complete the straight.
Yet, you will find yourself holding nothing but a gutshot straight draw on quite a few boards, so it is essential to understand the math and make the best of these hands.
Before we can discuss any strategy, we need to figure out how likely a gutshot straight draw is to land and how our pot odds look with such a hand.
According to the Texas Hold’em Odds calculator, holding 7h6h against AdAs on a board of Kc4d3s, we have 18.69% equity.
The majority of this equity comes from the chance to hit a 5 on the turn or river, but some of it also comes from the off-chance of making two pairs or trips by the river.
To make things simpler, we can use the rule of 4 and 2, which tells us to multiply our number of outs by 4 on the flop or by 2 on the turn to calculate our equity.
When holding a gutshot straight draw against a made hand like a pair or two pairs, we will have exactly four outs, which means we will have about 16% equity on the flop and 8% equity on the turn.
Of course, any additional options we may have, such as runner-runner trips, two pairs, or flush, may give us additional equity.
On the flip side, if we have a gutshot straight draw on a board with two or three cards of the same suit, some of our straight outs may not be clean, as they could make our opponents a flush.
For that reason, it is important to be careful when trying to calculate your equity with a gutshot straight draw and mainly only consider the outs that give you a clean straight.
A gutshot straight draw is technically any straight draw that can be completed by a single card rank in the deck, but not all gutshots are created equal.
Let us consider five different scenarios in which we flop a gutshot straight draw:
We start with scenario 1, which is one of the best possible gutshot straight draw scenarios. We have two overcards to the board, a backdoor flush draw, and a chance to make the nuts with any 8.
A gutshot straight draw like this gives you many options depending on the exact scenario, from calling bets to using the hand as a great bluffing candidate.
In scenario 2, we also have a gutshot to the nuts, but one that will often end up in a split pot if a Q does hit and a lot of money gets into the pot.
Still, we also have a backdoor flush draw and blockers to the nuts, which makes this hand a great one to bluff with and get our opponents to fold a wide poker range like JX, TX, and even KX on some runouts.
Scenario 3 gives us a much weaker gutshot straight draw. The 5 gives us a straight, but not the nuts, and we have a backdoor draw to a very weak flush.
This kind of a gutshot straight draw is often a good candidate for a fold to even a single bet, as it is not a hand you want to get too involved with.
The fourth scenario gives us a similar example of a hand that can only make the bottom end of a straight with one card but can’t even make a backdoor flush.
With two undercards and little hope of making anything good but a straight, this hand makes for an even easier fold in many situations and is not a great bluffing candidate.
Finally, the last gutshot scenario gives us two undercards with a gutshot to a straight that will often not be good, as any Ace will beat us if we do hit the Ten.
This kind of a gutshot straight draw is the least worth pursuing, and you should not value the fact you have a gutshot much when a scenario like this arises.
Generally speaking, you will make a gutshot straight draw either as the last preflop aggressor or as one of the defenders against the aggression.
When you make a raise or a 3-bet and go to a flop that gives you a gutshot, you have the initiative and can play your gutshot as a part of your overall betting strategy.
For example, imagine holding Th9h on the button in a $2/5 cash game. You raise it up to $15, and the player in the big blind makes the call.
With $32 in the pot, the flop comes Kd 7h 6s.
Your opponent checks to you. You have a gutshot to any 8, a backdoor flush draw, and most importantly, you have the initiative.
On a board like this, you can represent all the strongest hands, such as AA, KK, AK, 77, and 77, as well as K7s, K6s, and 76s, all of which you would have opened from the button.
Your opponent, on the other hand, can also have quite a few of these hands, but not AA, KK, or AK, as he did not re-raise your late position raise.
The board does hit your opponent’s defending range reasonably often, but many of the hands they make here are second pair, third pair, or a straight draw.
For that reason, you can start applying the pressure and fire out a $20 bet on this flop, with the intention of firing further barrels on later streets.
Your opponent calls, and you go to the turn card of 2d.
Your hand does not improve to a flush draw, but you still have the straight draw and can still have all the best hands on this board.
Your opponent checks once again, and this time, you fire $55 into the $72 pot. What can your opponent realistically do with a hand like 87, 86, 55, and many other hands in their range that only have a straight draw?
In most cases, this second barrel will work and get your opponent to fold everything but a King. If not, you may be able to continue telling your story on many rivers and even get players to fold a hand like KT.
The slight equity your gutshot straight draw gives you is enough to barrel off at boards like this.
On the flip side of the scenario, you will often find yourself as the defender holding a gutshot straight draw, and you will often be out of position when you do.
For example, imagine the same scenario from the last hand. This time, you are in the big blind, and the player on the button raises to $15, and you defend with 8s7s.
The board comes  5d6hQs, and you check to your opponent.
The player now fires a small bet of $10 into the $32 pot, which they would likely do with both their strong hands and many draws in their range.
You have enough equity and implied odds to make the call with your gutshot straight draw here, but this is also a great spot that a GTO poker strategy loves to start raising.

Your gutshot is not very likely to come in on the turn, and you will likely face further bets if you check the turn when you miss.
On the other hand, your opponent may very well have nothing more than an A or K-high and will be in a tough spot facing a raise on this board.
Hands like Q6, Q5, and 56 make a bigger portion of your range than they do of theirs, which means you can start repping those hands right here on the flop.
Putting in a raise to $45 on this flop will win you the pot more often than not, and even when it does not it will give you the initiative and a chance to steal the pot on later streets.
Every once in a while, you will face a 3-bet on this flop, and you will have a very easy fold, as your hand has very little actual equity against such a play.
The topic of a gutshot straight draws in poker is a long and extensive one, as there are many scenarios in which you make such hands on the flop or turn.
For that reason, it is worth spending quite a bit of time perfecting your play with gutshots, finding the best spots to use them as bluffs, and understanding how they work on different board textures.
If you want to be a master of Texas Hold’em Poker, practicing with simulations and hand examples of the many different gutshot straight draws is a must and something you should spend a decent amount of time doing.
Start with some basic examples and build yourself a basic strategy for a gutshot straight draws as aggressor and defender to begin with, and build upon that strategy as you gain more knowledge and confidence in the different possible scenarios.
### TOPIC: hand review
This is a hand I played in a $3/$5 NLHE game that has a mandatory $10 straddle. It had some interesting features that made me bring it to the PokerCoaching Discord group.
There are two limps of $10, and now a competent pro on the button makes it $50. The small blind folds, and I find K♥Q♦ in the big blind. The button is not a crazy person, and they’re not raising any two cards. But with two limpers in front of them, they will widen their range to try to take down the $35 in dead money.
I decide that my KQo is in fine shape against their range, and make a 4x 3bet to $200. Already, that was a little controversial. MrLorenzo wrote:
“First, I think you can flat. The chart below doesn’t take into account the limpers, but KQo calls vs BTN raise.”
And below that, Mr. Lorenzo had uploaded a chart showing KQo in the big blind calling a button raise. He acknowledged that the chart doesn’t take into account of the limpers, but we simply can’t ignore them.
You can make an argument for folding KQo if the button has a snug raising range. You can make an argument for 3-betting if the button is wider and/or I suspect he’s trying to isolate the two limpers and take down their dead money. You cannot make a good argument for calling here.
Anyway, I make it $200, and it folds back to the button, which thinks briefly and then calls. That was the second-best possible outcome. Obviously, my first choice was that the two limpers would fold, the button would chuckle, show me ten-seven suited, and throw it in the muck. But this was better than either or both of the limpers calling – had that happened, I’d have been in a mess. Note that the button 4-betting would have been a fine outcome – my cards are in the muck before their chips hit the felt.
But now, there’s $30 dead in the pot for me to share with the button, and I’m probably not in awful shape since they’d have presumably 4-bet their kings, aces, and sometimes queens or ace-king.
When facing a raise from the button, you mostly want to 3-bet from the big blind,especially with dead money in the pot.
With $425 in the pot, the flop is a pleasing K♣-9♥-2♣. So far so good. We started $1100 effective, so the SPR is 2:1.
It’s a bit dangerous to model this in a poker solver like GTOWizard since there’s no way to model the limpers. And 5x opens just aren’t a thing in the Sim. But let’s pretend that the button opens, I 3-bet from the big blind, and they call. GTOWizard has me c-betting my specific hand almost always on this flop. It spreads the sizes over four different buckets, but the good news is that it sees no difference among the EVs of any of the bet sizes (or checking, for that matter).
I choose to bet $115, which is pretty close to 25% of the pot.
Joey P (the MTT Hero) offered an intriguing alternative:
One option with a small SPR is to go 3E. Bet about $90 on the flop. With small SPRs 20% is always an option given by the solvers. That leaves about $810 behind with a $605 pot. Then go about $230 on the turn, leaving a bit under 1/2 pot for the river. That way you milk and tempt the lower pairs to be enticed by your sizings. You get paid off by more 9X hands and maybe even 88/77 type hands.
I think the old timers used to call this massaging the pot.
By the way, when Joey said “3E,” he’s suggesting a series of three bets, all an equal percentage of the pot, that will result in my shoving the river.
I actually love Joey’s suggestion, and my private coach, with no hints or suggestions, came up with the 3E idea as well. One way of looking at it is that no hand better than mine is folding – I’m at a hand strength inflection point. If my opponent has pocket aces, KK, or AK, they get my stack. Thus I should coax weaker hands to stay in the pot.
Using 3E sizing would maximize my chances of keeping those weaker hands in.
But I bet $115, my opponent thinks briefly and calls.
Are you a cash game crusher? Take the quiz that tells you!
There’s $655 in the pot, and the turn is a bricky 5♦.
There’s $785 left in the stacks, not much bigger than a pot-size bet. This is where made a big mistake – I jammed the rest in.
Note that had I followed Joey’s (and my coach’s) advice, the pot would have been a bit smaller going to the turn. But even after my bet on the flop, I could have gone 2E (two equal size bets to shove the river) on the turn. That would be $275. Maybe that keeps in QQ, pocket jacks, and perhaps KJs, if any of those hands ever get this far.
The only reasonable target for my shove would be some kind of flush draw, perhaps an ace-high draw that thinks an ace might be good. But hoping for a call from those hands was wishful thinking.
I put myself in a position where I was only going to get called by better hands.
My opponent paused only briefly, then said, “Well, I hope we’re chopping,” and slid in calling chips. As soon as they said that, I knew I was toast, and that they had ace-king.
Which is exactly what they turned up after I showed my hand.
Before putting your entire stack at risk, take your time and consider the spot.
I was going to lose my stack, one way or another, once that flop came out. When we started 110 big blinds effectively, got three bets in preflop with those big sizes, and then we both flopped top pair, all the chips were going in.
So I don’t feel bad about losing all my chips.
What I do feel bad about is how I lost them. The best way I could have lost them would have been to do 3E betting from the flop, as Joey and my coach suggested: $90, then $230, then the rest on the river. The second best way would have been with the flop bet size that I did use ($115) and then going 2E from the turn ($275, then the rest on the river).
Note that in all these scenarios, my opponent on the button gets all my chips, given the hand that they actually had. But there are many alternate universes where they have a different hand. And in those universes, they fold at some point in the hand after paying off a street or two. And in a very small number of universes, they actually pay off three streets of betting, and I double through them.
And I’m not the only one who struggles in spots such as this. Poster Mkindc said,
“I think your thought process is good. It’s raise or fold preflop – and what to do depends entirely on your read of your opponent.  You reasonably deduced that your hand performs well against the button’s range… so be it. Once the flop comes, you’re playing for stacks. Exactly how you play for stacks, I’m not entirely sure, but the money is going in.”
Clearly, I wasn’t sure how to play for stacks, either.
But now I know – 3E was very likely the best choice, and I’ll be ready for the next one.
I wasn’t the only one who learned something from the discussion. MrLorenzo, who had initially suggested that I should simply call the raise preflop, wrote toward the bottom of the thread:
“I believe this is a leak on my side. I tried to ‘save’ Lee from the tough spot he was in by suggesting a worse move and probably a tougher spot. We need to do the right thing, even if it’s going to be painful when the result is complicated.”
Yes, exactly. Sometimes doing the right thing puts us in tough spots. But when we have a resource such as the PokerCoaching Cash Game Discord, we can discuss these tough spots and learn how to navigate the most profitable path down the stream, even if it involves some choppy water.
### TOPIC: how to bluff
When I discuss the game of poker with people who do not play regularly, often I will hear them say “I would be an awful poker player, I’m terrible at lying!” or “I’m no good at cards, I have a terrible poker face!” By saying these things, these people are obviously referring to not knowing how to bluff.
Although a lot of success in poker is dictated by how well you can play the good hands you are dealt, the ability to bluff effectively in the right spots is critical to your overall success. Every poker player knows that you cannot “have it” every time, which means every now and then you must be able to pull off bluffs. That said, there is a science to properly bluffing, and in this article, I will share with you my system for optimally bluffing in poker games.
Bluffing in poker goes far beyond simply trying to psych out your opponent are intimidate them with aggression (or at least, it should go beyond that if you want to win money). Many recreational poker players decide to attempt bluffs when they are in spots where they know they cannot win the hand. While being behind in a hand is sometimes relevant when deciding to bluff, there are plenty of other variables worth considering before pulling the trigger.
To make your life easier at the cash game and poker tournament tables, I have compiled the following five questions worth asking yourself when deciding whether or not you should bluff. By allowing these questions to guide you, you can achieve a bluffing frequency that closely follows a GTO strategy.
Is Your Opponent Capable Of Folding?Do you lack showdown value?Do you have value hands in your range?Do you have relevant blockers or unblock auto-folds?Does your bluff tell a credible story?
After reading this question, you may say to yourself “my opponents never fold!” It may be that your opponents are in fact capable of folding, but you are just executing bad bluffs! That said, I recognize opponents who are calling stations or are simply bad poker players may struggle to fold as much as they should. If you are facing a calling station, it is likely in your best interest to play exploitative poker and avoid bluffing due to the likelihood that you will be looked up. While calling stations do exist, they serve as an extreme example when considering what your opponents are capable of folding.
Now, let’s say instead of a calling station, you are attempting to bluff your standard recreational $1/$2 player. The important factor to consider is not whether they never fold or always fold, the question is are they capable of folding in reasonable spots. If your opponent is holding a marginal hand like middle pair, will they fold to a large enough bet? If the answer is yes, you have successfully identified your opponent as “bluffable”.
If you know for a fact your hand cannot win at showdown, you should be more inclined to attempt bluffs. The biggest problem with this concept is many poker players at the low stakes do not know how to accurately assess their showdown value. Quite often, a hand like bottom pair should be bluffed not only because it lacks showdown value, but it also blocks hands like full houses and two pairs. It may sound crazy to consider bluffing with a hand like bottom pair, but you would much rather bluff with bottom pair than king-high as you unblock your opponent’s auto-folds.
Auto-Folds: Hands opponents will fold to any bet.
It is important to consider the range of you and your opponent before attempting bluffs. When assessing your range and its connectivity with the board, if you can identify a decent amount of value hands in your range you are in an optimal spot to bluff. What hands qualify as value hands? Usually, hands as strong as top pair and better are what you would consider “value” hands. If you have a number of such hands in your range but have total garbage, pull the trigger and attempt a bluff!
For those who are unfamiliar, a blocker is a card you hold in your hand that “blocks” your opponent from having not only that card but other hand combos that contain it. If you happen to have a relevant blocker in your hand, you should strongly consider bluffing as having a relevant blocker increases the likelihood that a bluff will get through. What qualifies as a relevant blocker? Relevant blockers consist of cards that block the nuts as well as hands that your opponent will always call with. If there are three diamonds on the board and you hold the A♦, you block the nut flush and should execute a bluff if you only have ace-high.
Somewhat the opposite of assessing hands you block, it is also important to consider whether you unblock the auto-folds in your opponent’s range. Harkening back to a previous example, hands like king-high qualify as auto-folds as they lack showdown value. If your hand does not contain a king and there is no king on the board, you essentially unblock your opponent from having king-high, and in turn, should consider bluffing. While it may take some practice to apply the thought process to your game, always consider not only what you block, but what you unblock as well.
Throughout the course of a poker hand, each action you take essentially tells a story to your opponents. If you are considering executing a bluff, it is important the actions you have taken prior to a spot resemble actions you would take if you held a premium value hand. A lot of novice poker players have the habit of playing their value hands one way and their bluffing hands another way. If you are facing opponents who are at least somewhat decent, they will be able to quickly pick up on the differences in your approach and easily recognize when you have it and when you don’t.
Checking the flop, turn, then blasting on the river with air does not tell a credible story if the board is not correct. Before risking a lot of or all of your stack with a bluff, make sure you consider whether the bluff is believable or not.
Make the best preflop decisions with Jonathan Little’s Push/Fold Charts!
Once you decide that you are going to attempt to bluff your opponent, you must consider how big of a bluff bet you are going to make. To disincentivize your opponents from calling, most of your bluff bets should be for a big size, but that does not mean you should bet big with your bluffs every time. Much like my list of questions to consider when deciding whether or not to bluff, here are my list of questions for when you are considering your bluff bet size.
Do you have zero showdown value?Does your opponent have marginal-made hands in their range?Do you unblock many nut hands and can you represent them?Are you trying to bluff your opponent off of a strong hand?
Although GTO recommends mixing your bet sizes when bluffing with little to no showdown value, I recommend only betting a big size if you lack it. Some highly skilled poker players are able to strike the proper frequencies when mixing their bet sizes, but such “mixing” is hard for most people to implement. To make your life easier, I recommend simply bluffing with a big bet size when you lack showdown value, and bluffing with a small bet size when you have some showdown value.
When considering what best size to bluff with, be sure you take your opponent’s tendencies into account. Some of your opponents will be willing to make loose calls to small bluff bets with only ace high. If you are attempting to bluff such an opponent, do not make a small bluff bet if you only have eight-high, as there is a low probability it will get through. Facing such opponents, bet big as it will give you a better chance of winning the hand.
Marginal-made hands are usually auto-calls for small bets and auto-folds for big bets. If your opponent usually check-raises top pair and better on the flop, but in a particular hand they check-called both the flop and the river, it is highly likely they have a marginal hand. Are you trying to bluff this opponent off of a marginal hand? Well, in that case, you should bluff with a big bet size.
Consider a hand where your opponent’s range and actions suggest they either have the nuts or an auto-fold hand. If you have a marginal hand that beats eight-high and an assortment of busted draws, you can get away with bluffing for a small size as it is unlikely you will get called. Rule of thumb: the more polarized your opponent’s range, the more often you can bluff with small bet sizes.
The more nut hands you block, the more nut hands you can represent with your bluffs. If you are trying to convince your opponent you have one of the best hands possible, it makes sense that you would be for a big size. When attempting big bluffs in cash games and poker tournaments, some of the best ones you can execute are ones where you can optimally represent the nuts. Remember though: be sure you have told a credible story on each betting street when attempting to represent the best hand.
By strong hands, I am not referring to the nuts, but decent hands like top pair with no kicker or middle pair. If you are trying to force your opponent to fold a decent hand, you will have to bet for a big size to get your bluff through. Never forget pot odds, as any reasonable opponent will never fold top pair to a small bet. Even though it may require you to put your whole stack at risk, to successfully bluff your opponent off of a good hand you must get over your fear of losing chips.
Truth #1: Players at the low stakes do not bluff enoughTruth #2: Players are often afraid to overbet when they bluffTruth #3: Players are afraid to bluff when they play live
Live, small stakes cash games remain incredibly profitable as most of the player population does not know how to properly bluff. Not only do low stakes players struggle knowing when to bluff, a lot of them refuse to attempt bluffs altogether! Even when they reach the river and a lot of money goes into the pot, players struggle to execute big bluffs because they are scared to lose money. While it certainly does sting when your bluff gets “caught”, realize that sometimes the only way to win money is by bluffing. By simply checking back and giving up, you rob yourself of the opportunity to steal a sizeable pot!
Many players at the small stakes are terrified of executing overpot bets as bluffs. When they bluff, usually they only bluff for no more than the pot. Not only should this motivate you to make big, overpot bets with your bluffs, but you should also overfold to your opponents when they bet big. If you know your opponents rarely make pot-sized or overpot bets on the river with bluffs, you can exploitatively fold by recognizing their tendencies.
When playing poker online, unless you insisted on having your username be your legal name, online poker rooms offer you a layer of anonymity. When you’re “pressing buttons” in a $5 tournament on WSOP.com, you may not be that embarrassed when your 150% pot overbet doesn’t get through. However, if you attempt the same bluff for $300 in your local poker room’s $1/$2 game, if your bluff gets caught you may be embarrassed. Here lies the third truth of why some low stakes players struggle to execute bluffs: they are embarrassed of having their bluffs get caught.
If you want to have success and eventually move up stakes, you must get over this mindset. Trust me, the more experience you get bluffing in live cash games and poker tournaments, the less self-conscious you will be when your bluffs fail. Also, don’t forget, sometimes your bluffs will work and reward you with huge pots!
While I have mostly discussed bluffing at the small stakes throughout this article, the following “spectrum” chart below applies to all stakes. As you encounter a wide array of poker players at the tables, all of them will fall somewhere within this spectrum when it comes to their bluffing frequencies and aggression. You will rarely come across players you reach a Perfectly Balanced (Level 6) standing when it comes to bluffing. Although some of these players are out there, if you play the small stakes most of your opponents will remain within levels 1 through 3.
Levels of River Bluff Aggression:
When you play small stakes cash games, the “money factor” and risk of each decision can make it hard to play optimally. Sometimes, to have the best chance of winning a pot you will have to execute a bluff worth your whole stack. To the average guy, losing $300-$400 dollars is certainly not enjoyable. However, if you elect to simply give up on every river and only add money to the pot when you have the nuts, you take the “game” out of poker and turn it into simply “who has the best hand?” By studying regularly and keeping a proper poker bankroll, you can be better equipped to bluff and be more confident when you do so. Apply the lessons from this article to your game, and your opponents will never quite know what you’re holding!
### TOPIC: implied odds
Implied odds are one of those concepts that you often hear being thrown around in poker conversations but that many players don’t fully understand. In fact, it could be said that a vast majority of casual poker players don’t know how they work, often overestimating or underestimating their significance.
More importantly, actual calculations needed to get to the bottom of implied odds remain a mystery even to many players who play the game seriously, which is why it is an important topic to cover in more detail.
If you have mastered your outs counting and pot odds, it is time to master the idea of implied odds as well and learn how to calculate your implied odds once and for all.
Implied odds are an extension of basic pot odds that factor in the money you can potentially win on future streets if you hit your draw. Instead of evaluating whether a call is immediately profitable, implied odds help you assess whether calling now can lead to a bigger payoff later, particularly when you expect opponents to put more chips in the pot if your hand improves. For example, drawing to a flush or straight may be unprofitable based on pot odds alone, but becomes worthwhile when implied odds are considered. Good implied odds require deep stacks and opponents likely to pay you off, making player tendencies and bet sizing key considerations.
Implied odds in poker represent the amount of money you stand to win on further betting streets if you hit one of the outs you were chasing.
Good implied odds mean that you stand to win a lot of extra money on further betting streets if your hand improves, with draws like gutshot straight draws offering some of the best opportunities.
If there is a good chance you will win more money on future streets when you improve, your implied odds are favorable.
On the other hand, if it looks like your opponent will get out of your way when you improve, your implied odds are not looking so great.
Of course, this is all just a simplification. We will discuss how to calculate implied odds in your poker games in more detail.
Calculating implied odds to an exact number would be impossible because there are too many variables at play and no exact poker math. You cannot predict exactly how your opponent will react to certain cards, bet sizes, etc.
However, we can calculate the minimum amount of money we need to win on future streets to make our play profitable despite the pot odds being presented at the moment.
When playing live poker it is easy to get distracted, especially if you are playing in a fun, lively game! That said, being able to focus and calculate pot odds and implied odds is critical to success.
We have just explained that the exact probability of winning certain amounts of money on the futures betting street is impossible to calculate because there are too many variables in play.
Implied odds calculations, for that reason, focus on calculating the minimum amount of money we need to win in the future to make our call profitable.
This is useful in situations when direct pot odds don’t allow us to proceed with our hand, as we don’t have enough equity with our draw.
Yet, if there is more money behind in our stack and our opponents’ stacks, making a call can still be profitable if there is a chance for more money to go into the pot.
So, let’s use an example scenario to explain the implied odds calculation. We will start with a hand from the $2/5 Texas Hold’em cash game.
Sitting on a $500 stack, you are dealt 9♠8♠ on the BB. UTG opens to $15, you make the call, and all other players get out of the way.
With $37 in the pot, you check the K♣7♠2♦ board, and your opponent decides to bet small for $10. You make the call with your backdoor draws, and the turn reveals the 6♦, giving you an open-ended straight draw.
You check again, and your opponent now bets $40 into the $57 pot. A quick pot odds calculation tells the following story:
$40 (needed to call) / ($40 bet + $57 pot + $40 call) = $40/$173 = 0.218
This means we need 21.8% equity to make this call profitable. A quick look at our odds against some possible hands, such as K♥10♥, tells us that we only have about 15% equity against many of them. Our equity against our opponent’s entire range isn’t that great either since we will almost surely lose if unimproved.
However, we do have an open-ended straight draw, giving us eight cleat outs to the nuts, all of which means we win the hand.
Having a slight equity deficit in this situation, we will need to make some extra money on the river to make our call now profitable, but how much exactly?
To determine that, we will use the following implied odds formula:
Amount to Call / (Opponent’s Bet + Pot Size + Amount to Call + Money We Need to Win on River) = Equity
In this case, the calculation would look like this:40 / (40 + 57 + 40 + X) = 0.1540 / (137 + X) = 0.1540 = 137 * 0.15 + X * 0.1540 = 20.55 + X * 0.15X * 0.15 = 40 – 20.55X * 0.15 = 19.45X = 129.6
Using this calculation, you can see that we need to win an extra $129.6 (let’s call it $130) to make our call on the turn profitable.
Considering the pot will be $137 when we make this call, we would need to extract a full pot-size bet on the river to make this call profitable.
With only one betting street left to go and our opponent not likely to have a monster hand right now, making the call would probably not be justifiable in this particular situation.
However, if the bet was slightly smaller, we could probably argue for making the call, even if we still don’t quite have enough equity to make it in relation to pot odds.
For instance, if the bet was $30, you would need to win about $83 on the river to make the call profitable, which would be a more realistic number.
In either case, this same formula can be applied in any situation in which pot odds alone are not enough to justify a call but in which your hand could improve and get you paid on the remaining streets.
However, maybe there is a way to use this situation to your advantage. Let’s explore the alternative option.
Implied odds tell us how much money we need to win in the future to make a current bet profitable and can help us make calls that are not justified by pot odds alone.
However, implied odds can also help us make good bluffs with a number of drawing hands that don’t really justify a call regardless of implied odds.
In our previous example, we saw a situation in which a call was perhaps not a great idea, as the amount of money we needed to win on the river was pretty high, and our opponent’s range was not super strong.
These kinds of situations make it ideal to turn our hand into a bluff and represent having a monster hand instead.
For instance, if we raised it to $150 in our previous example instead of calling the $40, we would put our opponent in a very difficult situation.
They would be forced to fold hands like underpairs and strong A-highs that simply can’t handle the pressure on the board in question and would have a hard time even with hands like Kx.
What’s even more, we could apply further pressure by following our bluff with an all-in play on the river, and we could also make our straight 15% of the time.
Let Jonathan Little teach you how to bluff like the pros!
There are quite a few extra things you need to take into consideration when thinking about making a call or turning your hand into a bluff on account of implied odds.
We will now look over a few of these considerations, so make sure to think about these the next time you are put into an interesting implied odds situation:
Implied odds are an important part of the game of poker and can often be used to make the correct play in a situation that doesn’t seem to warrant it at first glance.
However, it is also incredibly important not to trust implied odds too much and to make the right calculations before you decide to go against the pot odds.
Take all the considerations we mentioned into account and learn how to calculate implied odds in poker, and you will become a better poker player for it, guaranteed! If you are new to the concept, make sure to play with our poker odds calculator and get a grasp of the basic math behind it.
### TOPIC: max value with second nuts
It’s hard to make an extremely strong poker hand. I mean, in hold’em it’s hard to make a strong hand. In 5-card PLO, it’s really easy – the problem is that your opponents find it just as easy, and sometimes make an even stronger hand.But on those rare occasions in hold’em when you do make a monster, you want to get full value for it. Here’s a hand I witnessed a friend play – it’s a good example of finding a balance get max value while avoiding a brick wall.
My friend Mark and I were playing a $5/$5 no-limit Texas Hold’em game (two cards, not five) in the Los Angeles area. We got into an interesting hand, by which I mean Mark got into an interesting hand – I don’t remember what trash I folded. Mark was in the big blind, and his opponent in this hand was the small blind. We’ll call the opponent “Sam” for convenience.
Sam was relatively new to the table, and had intended to be in the smaller $3/$5 game. But there were no seats in those games so he opted to stay in the $5/$5 game. Already we have some information about Sam – he prefers to play smaller, and this may be somewhat out of his comfort/expertise zone.
The hand begins with a classic L.A. set piece: four people limp, Sam limps in the small blind, and Mark wisely checks with A♠️6❤️ in the big blind. Sam has run his $300 minimum buy-in up to $800. Mark covers him by a bit.
In what is now known as “Texas heads-up,” they go six ways to the flop with $25 in the pot after the drop. The flop is 3♦️-7♠️-T♠️. Sam and Mark both check, Mark planning to fold his cards at the first whisper of a bet. But that bet doesn’t come as the flop checks all the way around.
The turn makes the board 3♦️-7♠️-T♠️–2♠️, and suddenly Mark is interested again. Again, Sam and Mark check, but this time the UTG player bets $20 into the $25 pot. A middle-position player calls the $20, the button calls, Sam calls in the small blind, and Mark calls too.
Mark and I would later discuss this hand in excruciating detail over excellent bowls of phở. This was the first decision point that I wanted to challenge. Did he consider check/raising the turn? He, alone, knew where the nuts were. And the SPR was extremely high for a pot that went 38 ways to the flop. Suppose he made it $150 to go? Who would dare call such a raise? It sure looks like nobody has a very big hand – anybody who flopped better than one pair would certainly want to bet such a wet board.
As I noted at the beginning: it’s hard to make a monster, and Mark currently has ace-high. If he maximizes his fold equity and makes it $150, he’s risking $150 to win a $100 pot. His raise only has to win the pot 60% of the time to be profitable, and that’s ignoring his actual equity in the hand. I bet that raise clears the field more like 80% of the time.
Suppose Mark makes it $150 on the turn. 80% of the time, everybody laughs at his enormous raise and folds. Mark profits $100 x 80% = $80. 20% of the time, he gets called by somebody. Let’s agree that Mark isn’t going to fire a second barrel on blank rivers because anybody willing to call a raise that big must be strapped in. So 20% of the time, Mark gets called and needs to get there. Of course, 80% of the rivers he whiffs completely, and his $150 turn investment is lost. So he loses $150 x 20% (the times that he’s called) x 80% (that he whiffs the river) = $24 loss. Still, he’s showing an $80-$24 = $56 profit for his $150 raise.
Ha, I see some of you out there waving your hands. You’re absolutely correct – there’s one little pie slice we haven’t covered. That’s where Mark gets called on the turn but then gets there on the river. There’s $325 in the pot, and Mark is likely to get a small bet called – let’s say $75. This outcome is a long-shot – 20% of the time he gets called on the turn, times 20% of the time he gets there on the river. So it only happens 4% of the time. But hey, that’s 4% of the $400 pot he wins when gets there – another $16 in EV. So his total anticipated profit from check/raising the turn is $56 + $16 = $82.
Note that when he calls the turn, as he did, he still gets there 20% of the time. And he probably wins a small bet on the river when he does. So his equity in the pot on the turn is 20% x $105 = $21. Maybe he can get a $40 bet called on the river when he makes his flush (noting it will be a one-card flush). So that’s 20% equity in that extra $40 he’ll get –  $4. Thus Mark’s expected win is $25, for his turn investment of $20, for a net profit of $5.
It’s a profitable call, but man, the fold equity and pot odds of check/raising the turn looks a lot more profitable.
By the way, Mark didn’t believe my “You clear the field 80% of the time with this 7.5x check/raise.” He felt the probability of success was lower. Of course, that’s fine, and Mark’s welcome to plug in his own percentage and see how the EV stacks up.
However, I claim that the $20 bet and calls can represent a giant array of trashy hands. $20 is not a big absolute number in a $5 blind game, and folks are willing to pay that much for a lottery ticket to the river. However, $150 is a big absolute number in a $5 blind game, and is likely to fold out everything except very big hands that are trapping. Since Mark is looking at the ace of trump, the most likely trapping hand (the nut flush) doesn’t exist – 80% is a perfectly reasonable estimate of ending the hand on the turn.
Of course, I didn’t know any of this as I watched the hand play out – I just knew that when the river card was the 6♠️, making the board 3♦️-7♠️-T♠️–2♠️–6♠️, I thought, “Now there’s a fifth street, right there.”
Sam in the small blind checks, then Mark checks.
“Wait – what? Mark checked his one-card nut flush?”
Yeah, I know. Everybody at the table, and the passing chip-runner, could see the four-flush on the board. I don’t know why in the world Mark thought he was going to get a bet from behind him. Five people saw the river – did he think that a set or the queen-high flush would actually bet?
I really dislike Mark’s check – when you make a one-card nut flush, you have to value bet it for yourself. I would go for a chunky B60 ($75) bet, targeting the king or queen of spades.
Of course, I say all that, but then the most L.A. thing ever happens: it checks to the button, who bets $30 into the $125 pot. This bet might as well have a giant arrow pointing to it saying, “Cheap bluff!”
And that’s when the hand turns weird. Sam, in the small blind, check/raises to $130. When he did that, I thought, “Well, there’s the ace of spades.” But now Mark is contemplating his options, and I’m all, “What in the world is going on here?”
Finally Mark calls, and the button immediately folds (cheap bluff confirmed).Sam says, “Do you have the ace?” and turns up the K♠️ and some other card. Mark nods and tables his A♠️6❤️.
This hand kept us busy at the post-game Vietnamese restaurant. With basil-infused steam wafting to our faces, I offered my post-mortem on the fifth street play.
I explained why it made no sense to check the river – there was an awfully good chance that it would check right through, and Mark would sheepishly table his hand. Maybe Sam would quietly slip the K♠️ into the muck and Mark would never know the value he missed. It was only because of the button’s silly min-bet hopeless bluff, and Sam’s “adventurous” check/raise that Mark managed to get some extra added value for his near-nuts.
Mark said that he was thinking about raising to $350 or $400, but he worried that maybe Sam had the dreaded 9♠️8♠️ for the straight flush. He decided that he would try to bring in the button by flat-calling Sam’s check/raise, limiting his loss if Sam had the actual nuts.
Mark’s poker buddy Don was with us – he and Mark got into a spirited discussion about whether Mark could fold if he made it $350 and Sam shoved.
I wanted to spray them both with sriracha sauce.
“We know that Sam has already, by definition, made a serious mistake. If he had exactly 9♠️8♠️, then he flatted a nine-high flush on the turn in a five-way pot, knowing that any spade except the 6♠️ or J♠️ would almost certainly cost him the pot. If he didn’t have the straight flush, then he was check/raising a hand no better than the king-high flush with a four-flush on the board.”
Chopsticks waving for effect, I noted that combinatorically, the likelihood of the latter error (over-valuing a non-nut hand) was much greater than him having the actual-two-exact-cards-in-the-deck nuts.
Furthermore, the button was never calling. Mark was looking at the second nuts, and Sam the SB had just check/raised the button’s bet. The button was just the poor catalyst for the chemistry between Mark and Sam – his hand was two Target gift cards.
Therefore, Mark should have ripped his remaining stack in.
All three of us agreed that when Sam check/raised the river it was never a bluff. Lower stakes players, such as Sam, do not check/raise the river with the intention of folding. Mark was in an enviable, “Welp, if you have the ace of spades, you have it and good for you” situation.
“But what if Sam had the straight flush?”
“Then you lose 160 big blinds and good for Sam. Not going for stacks here is worrying about a rare monster under the bed. A unicorn monster.”
I believe that my friend Mark, hoping to avoid a bad, but extremely unlikely outcome, missed a chance to get Sam’s entire stack. Had Mark shoved, it would have been for Sam’s remaining $645. Sam would be calling $645 to win a $1,060 pot. Remember, Sam had already check/raised on the river – we know that he had already overvalued his king-high flush. Given the chance to see the showdown and win an absurdly big pot, it would have been awfully hard to fold.
Mark and I respect each other’s play, and I hope he won’t object to my making an example of this hand. It’s also provably true that most of us (myself included) write and post far better than we play. For instance, there’s no guarantee I’d have found that sweet check/raise on the turn, but I’m 100% sure it would have been the correct play.
Great hand Mark, and thanks for the phở.
### TOPIC: optimize cbetting
Continuation bet (also known as a c-betting in poker) is one of the most common plays you will encounter in modern poker, and it is one that you will have to apply in a large number of hands yourself.
If you have been playing for a while, you probably already understand this basic poker strategy and have an idea of what a c-bet is and when it is applied, but we are also going to cover those very basic things for the players who are only just getting introduced to the concept of c-betting in poker.
Furthermore, the article will discuss how often you should c-bet, what board textures are best to fire c-bets on, how to size up your c-bets, and more.
By the time you are done reading this article, your knowledge of the concept of c-betting in poker will have improved drastically, and all that will be left is to practice c-betting in different scenarios and on different board textures to reach perfection.
But let’s start with the poker basics and explain what a c-bet is and when it comes into play.
C-bet is a popular poker term that stands for “continuation bet” and refers to the first bet made by the last preflop aggressor on the flop.
Anytime you raise or re-raise before the flop, get one or multiple calls, and bet out on the flop, you are effectively c-betting.
Any flop c-bet made by the preflop aggressor is considered a c-bet, whether the player has hit the flop or not, which is why a c-bet is not a bluff or a value bet in itself.
Generally speaking, you will be c-betting a mix of bluffs and value across all board textures, making it difficult for your opponents to know when you have a big hand and when you don’t and setting up future bets on turns and rivers.
By making a c-bet, you are telling your opponents that you have made a hand on the flop or that you already had a pair to begin with, and this is a story you can keep telling with further bets.
A c-bet is a crucial part of an aggressive poker strategy, which is the only way to play poker properly, so it is key that you master the art of c-betting if you want to become a successful poker player.
We have explained what a c-bet is in poker in the most basic of terms, but let’s take a look at a couple of examples of c-bets that will make the concept even more clear.
In the first example, you are dealt 9s8s in the cutoff in a poker tournament, with blinds set at 500/1000 and an effective stack of 60,000 chips.
You open to 2,300, the button and small blind folds, and big blind defends, making the pot 6,100 with the ante in the middle.
The flop comes 9h5d3s, giving you a top pair and some backdoor draws. Your opponent checks to you, and you fire a GTO poker approved bet of 1,500.
We will not go into this hand further, as your opponents’ reactions to your c-bet don’t matter for the time being. We are only trying to understand the concept of a c-bet, and this 1,500 bet on the flop is a classic example of one.
Another example of a c-bet is one where you are dealt AcKh on the button in a $2/5 live cash game with effective stacks of $500.
You open to $15 and get a call from the big blind. With $32 in the pot, you see a flop of 5c3c3d, giving you just a backdoor flush draw and two overcards.
When the big blind checks to you, you fire a bet of $10 into the pot. The only real difference between the first and the second example is the fact you made the top pair in the first one and have only Ace-high in the second one.
However, in both examples, firing a c-bet is correct, as the range of hands you are representing includes many value hands, and your opponents are likely to fold hands that have quite a bit of equity against you and occasionally call with weaker hands as well.
We fired a small c-bet in both cases, which means that even if our opponents only fold their cards occasionally, we are printing money with the c-bet alone, without taking into account the follow-up bets we plan on firing on a number of turns and rivers.
Once you reach a flop in a poker hand as the preflop aggressor, one of the first things you should consider is your table position. Are you in position or out of position versus your opponents?
Typically speaking, you will have a chance to c-bet a lot more in position than out of position for several reasons.
The most common scenario where you can c-bet in position is one in which you open in a late seat, and the big blind comes along getting a good price to call with a wide range of hands.
However, this wide range is going to include very few actually strong hands and is going to miss approximately 70% of all boards.
This means you can c-bet pretty much your entire range on almost all boards in this scenario, and you are likely to get a lot of folds from your opponent’s fairly weak range.
On the other hand, whenever you find yourself c-betting out of position, that means you either raised in an early position and got called by one of the late positions or you 3-bet from the blinds and got called by the original opener.
In both cases, the in-position player will have a much stronger range than a big blind defender. This range will include many small and medium pairs, as well as hands with suited Broadway cards like QJs or JTs and suited connectors like 98s and 87s.
This range is going to be much stronger on a lot of boards, which means you should be c-betting less as you stand to get fewer folds from your opponent on the flop.
Once action reaches the flop, you don’t have much of an idea as to your opponent’s exact two cards, but you can have quite a good idea about their overall poker range of hands.
For that reason, you should always consider how their perceived range connects with the board texture that was dealt out, as well as how your perceived range connects with the board.
For instance, let’s imagine you open from an early position in a tournament and get called by the big blind with a 50 bb effective stack.
The flop comes KsQc9h. On this board, against the big blind, you have a massive range advantage, as you have all the strongest hands in your range, while your opponent does not.
In most cases, the opponent would have 3-bet KK and QQ, as well as AA, before the flop, which means you can take those hands out of consideration. On the other hand, you still have all combos of these hands in your range.
This is when you can should start considering poker combinations. Both you and your opponent have combos of JTs in your range, and while your opponent is more likely to have JT off-suit, you are way more likely to have hands like AKs, AK, KQs, and 99, all of which are monsters on this board.
On the other hand, imagine a scenario where you open in an early position and get called by the dealer in the same tournament at the same effective stacks.
This time, the flop comes Ts8s7h, and now your opponent has quite a big range advantage on you, as they have a lot of hands that connect heavily with this board.
The player on the dealer has combos of TT, 88, and 77, as well as J9s in their range, along with hands like JTs and 87s. In some cases, depending on how loose the dealer is, they could even have hands as weak as J9 off-suit and 87 off-suit, although this is not part of the optimal strategy in their spot.
In either case, our range is now made up of a lot of hands that either missed the flop altogether or have to be quite worried about it, which means we should be c-betting a lot less frequently.
The next time you are considering a c-bet, think about how your range and your opponent’s ranges connect with the flop that was dealt out, and you should have a pretty good idea of how likely they are to fold their cards faced with your bet.
One thing that most players get wrong when they just start learning how to play poker is the frequency of c-bets in multiway pots.
Typically, players will c-bet the same hands against one, two, or three preflop callers, and this is quite a big mistake.
While you can get away with c-betting a ton in heads-up pots, especially in position, you should c-bet a lot less in multiway pots.
Your c-betting range in heads-up pots will generally be quite linear, as it will include your strong hands, your good bluffs, as well as plenty of complete bluffs and hands value hands that have not exactly smashed the board.
For instance, on a board of AcQd8d, you could c-bet hands like AA, QQ, 88, bluffs like Kcjs, Jd9d, as well as hands like KK, KQ, and 98. Against a big blind caller who is likely to fold a lot on this board, you would even be c-betting a hand as weak as 5c4c and get away with it.
However, if this same flop was dealt four-way, you should be c-betting a lot less frequently, as it is very likely one of the other players has made some kind of a hand.
In a multiway scenario on this same board, you would still bet hands like AA, QQ, 88, and AQ, as well as bluffs like KdJd, JdTd, and KdTd. However, hands like KsJs would no longer make for good bluffing candidates, while hands like KK or KQ would not be strong enough to bet multiway.
As a general rule of thumb, you should bet a much tighter range made up of pure value and your strongest bluffs in multiway pots, and this is especially true when more than three players see the flop.
Another very important thing that many players don’t really think about enough is the size of your c-bets when you do decide to make them.
Once you have decided that your hand falls into the range of hands you should be c-betting on a given board. You need to also think about how much is the right bet size.
Board texture is the most important factor in this decision, as it dictates how likely your opponents are to call you and the types of hands they will call with.
On static boards like Kd6s6c, small continuation bets are typically preferred, as it is unlikely your opponent has connected with the board, increasing the likelihood of a fold regardless of your bet size.
On this board, firing a small c-bet with the entire range you opened before the flop makes sense, as most opponents will easily fold hands like Qh7h or JdTh, which they may have called your preflop raise in the big blind without much thought.
On the other hand, dynamic boards like Jh9h8s require you to bet a more polarized range, as discussed earlier, and warrant a bigger c-bet.
On a board like this, you would never be betting your weak value hands like 8c7c, but would rather only bet your strongest value hands and your best bluffs.
For that reason, your range will be very strong, and you can make a much bigger bet on the flop. What’s more, a big bet will help you deny your opponent’s equity when they have hands like gutshot straight draws or weak one-pair hands that would be forced to continue against a small bet.
When considering your c-bet size, think about what percentage of your range you are betting on a given board texture. The more hands you are betting, the smaller your c-bet should be.
If you are betting your entire range, aim to bet 25% to 35% of the pot. If you are only betting a small percentage of your range made up of strong value and big bluffs, a bet of 65% or more makes sense.
The number of possible situations and boards that come up in No Limit Texas Hold’em can be a bit intimidating at first, but there is no reason for concern.
As with all things, practice makes perfect, and the more you practice your c-betting skills, the more likely you will be to make the right decisions when they come up in real poker games.
Use poker solvers and other tools to find the solutions for the c-betting spots that confuse you the most, and practice your c-betting ranges and sizes until you feel comfortable with nearly any board texture out there.
The more repetitions you get in, the more confident you will feel, and the more successful you will be in making the right c-bets at the right time.
### TOPIC: pickings value bet spots
The very best players in the game have a wide range of plays and skills at their disposal, but some come into play more often than others.
Value betting is certainly at the very top of that list, as getting proper value for your big hands is very important, especially when playing the game at lower levels.
While bluffing is definitely an integral part of the game, even at the low stakes, getting the value when you actually have the goods is even more important, as players at low stakes don’t like to fold too much.
In this article, we are going to explain what value betting in poker is, how to recognize the right spots to value bet, and how to make sure that you get maximum value from all your hands.
Value betting involves wagering with the expectation that opponents will call with inferior hands, thereby maximizing profit when holding a strong hand.Key Strategies:* Assess Opponent’s Range: Determine if your opponent’s likely holdings include hands worse than yours that they might call with. If so, a value bet is appropriate.* Understand Opponent Tendencies: Against players who frequently call bets, consider value betting even with moderately strong hands. Conversely, against tight players, be more selective.* Consider Your Table Image: If you’ve been playing aggressively, opponents may call your bets more often, allowing for thinner value bets. If perceived as tight, opponents may fold more, requiring stronger hands for value betting.* Bet Sizing: Choose bet sizes that weaker hands will call. Overly large bets may scare off opponents, while too small bets may not extract maximum value.* Don’t Fear Thin Value Bets: Even if your hand isn’t the absolute best, if it’s likely better than your opponent’s calling range, a value bet can be profitable.By effectively implementing these strategies, you can enhance your profitability through well-executed value bets.
Before we can discuss specifics, we must first define value betting and how it differs from other types of bets in poker.
By definition, a value bet is any bet made for value, meaning one that we hope gets called by an opponent holding an inferior hand.
Unlike a bluff bet, which is made with the hope that others will fold their cards, a value bet is made with the high hopes of getting a call and winning a big pot.
You can start value betting from the very start of a poker hand. Whether you are raising before the flop with pocket Aces, betting the flop with top pair, or going all-in on the river with the nut straight, all of these are considered value bets.
There are many spots where making a value bet is very straightforward, as our hand is so strong that there is no question we want to bet it and get maximum value.
On the other hand, there are also situations in which it is not clear if a value bet is warranted, and these are the ones worth talking about in more depth.
The next time you find yourself in a tricky spot and are not sure whether to make a thin value bet or not, you will have some frame of reference if you keep reading this guide to value betting in poker.
One of the biggest mistakes new poker players make is checking their option when they have a hand that is very likely to be the best hand in a given situation.
Players will often do so out of concern for their opponent having a bigger hand and out of fear that their opponent will fold a worse hand, but the truth is that you should be betting for value in the vast majority of cases if you believe you have the best hand.
Against amateur players, you will want to bet for value often as they will continue to draw even with very weak draws. Against good poker players, betting for value is a key part of balancing out your range and being able to bluff at a high frequency as well.
When thinking about whether or not to bet on a given betting street, you should think about the probability your hand is best and the probability your opponent will call you with a worse hand.
If the odds are your hand is best, and your opponent will often call with a weaker hand, you should be betting for value by all means.
If the odds are that your hand is not the best or that your opponent will not call with a weaker hand, you may want to skip a value bet for the time being.
If you imagine a scenario in which you are holding the nuts on the river, and your opponent checks to you, it is fairly obvious that you want to make a value bet in this scenario 100% of the time.
On the other hand, there are plenty of more complex value betting examples in which your hand is not very strong in absolute terms, but your opponent is still likely to make a call against your bet with weaker hands than yours.
When deciding whether or not to value a bet, you should always consider all the available information and do your best in accordance with the likelihood of your opponent having a hand good enough to make a call with but not good enough to beat you.
Let’s talk about some of the factors that may come into play when deciding whether or not to make a value bet.
The first thing to think about when deciding whether or not to make a value bet is your opponent’s range and how it connects with the board.
The more likely your opponent is to have connected with the board, the more you will want to bet for value with hands like top pair or better, which still rate to be the best.
For instance, imagine raising from an early position in a cash game, holding KcQc, and getting calls from the button and the big blind.
The flop comes QdJs7s and the big blind checks to you. This is a flop you will always want to make a value bet on, as it is very likely that one or both of your opponents have connected with the board.
You will be betting value from weaker Queens, all Jacks, some suited Sevens, and pocket pairs like 99, 88, as well as 66 and below sometimes, straight draws, as well as various Spade flush draws.
On the other hand, the only hands that really beat you here are QJ, 77, and the occasional AQ or JJ that decided not to 3-bet before the flop.
With so many hands in your opponents’ ranges that you beat and so few that are better than yours, a value bet is warranted 100% of the time, and a big one will do the trick on a board like this.
While you may want to balance by checking some of the time in games against tough opponents, against your average poker players, you will want to fire a continuation bet in this spot 100% of the time.
Another thing that is worth considering when choosing between value betting and checking is your opponent and any specific reads you have on them.
When playing poker online, you often have actual stats on your opponent available, which can help inform your decisions and help you make the right play.
The more likely your opponent is to call bets, the more likely you should be to value bet anytime you have a hand that is reasonably strong in absolute terms.
For example, imagine playing in a $0.25/0.50 Texas Hold’em cash game online with effective stacks of $50 and opening AsAc from the middle position, only to get called by the big blind who has been playing a 40% VPIP and 40% WTSD (went to showdown).
This player’s stats show us that he plays way too many hands in general and simply loves to go all the way to the river once he gets involved in a pot.
The flop comes Jd9c8c. You fire a big c-bet into the pot and get called, only to see the 8d roll off on the turn. You bet once again and get a call. The river reveals the 2c, and your opponent checks once again.
This is a somewhat dicey spot and one that many average players check back almost 100% of the time, as they are afraid of their opponent having a flush, an Eight, or even a full house.
However, if we consider the fact our opponent loves going to a showdown and all the various hands that we are still beating, this river becomes a mandatory value bet.
We can still beat hands like J9, AJ, KJ, QJ, JT, TT, T9, and others, while we only lose to a handful of possible card combos. What’s even more, we hold the Ac, making the nut flush impossible and a flush in general less likely.
With our opponent never exhibiting any aggression, we can comfortably go for a half-pot bet in this spot, and we should not expect to get raised too much at the lower stakes. If we do get raised, our opponent likely has a better hand than our pocket Aces.
Playing live poker games, you won’t have stats like these readily available, so it will be your job to pay attention and try to get some reads on how your opponents play and what their general tendencies are.
Another thing worth keeping in mind when deciding between a value bet and a check is your image. This comes into play even more in live games, but it can also be important in online poker games, as other players will often have stats on you.
Once you reach that close spot between a check and a bet, your image might be the exact thing to think about.
Generally speaking, if you are a very aggressive player who loves to bluff often, you should also be value betting thinly a lot more often than most other players.
On the other hand, if you have been playing nitty and have not created an image of a maniac, you should be careful not to value bet too thinly, as your opponents are more likely to fold to your value bets, making it hard to get called by worse.
Imagine the following scenario. You have been playing in a live $2/5 game for several hours and have a stack of $700. You have been fairly card-dead and have only played a few hands, showing the nuts at showdown three times without winning any big pots with bluffs.
You are dealt 9s9h in early position, and you raise it to $12, getting called by the small blind and the big blind.
With $36 in the pot, you see a flop of Th8s6s. You fire a c-bet of $20 and get called by the SB while the BB gets out of the way.
With $76 in the pot, the dealer puts out the 3d. Your opponent checks, and you bet $40 this time around, once again getting called.
The river is the 3c and your opponent again checks to you. This is one of those spots where your own image comes into play.
If you were playing very aggressively and created an image of a maniac, you could easily fire a value bet of some $100 into the $156 here, expecting to get called by any curious 8x, 6x, 77, and even A-high on occasion.
However, if you believe your opponent perceives you as tight and fairly straightforward, you can expect that they folded some of these hands on the turn and are more likely to be holding Tx or a draw of some sort on the river.
For that reason, a check on the river may be more prudent if you are perceived as tight, while a bluff bet with your busted draws could make a lot more sense, as you would expect your opponent to have a very hard time calling yet another bet from you.
Betting for value when you have the best hand is one of the most important things in poker, and yet it is also the one thing that many players are most afraid of doing.
While pretty much everyone will bet with the nuts on the river, many players often miss amazing value betting spots with weaker hands, like one pair or two pairs on scary boards where they might be beaten.
If you want to reach the level of an elite poker player one day, you will have to change the way you think about value betting and remember that you don’t have to be right every single time when you make a value bet.
As long as your value bets get called by weaker hands often enough, you will be printing money one value bet at a time, so make sure to spend some time studying these close value betting spots so you can incorporate more value bets into your game in the future.
Instead of practicing those intricate bluffing spots, make sure to put more effort into your value betting game, and you will see your results skyrocket and your sessions become a lot more entertaining as you scoop one big pot after another without actually holding the nuts.
### TOPIC: playing against nits
There used to be a time when poker nits were able to dominate the game and win big at the poker tables, much thanks to the generally low level of play across the board. As poker games got tougher and tougher over the years, the nitty approach lost all appeal, and most players started moving away from playing an overly tight strategy.
However, even in today’s games, you will occasionally run across a poker nit who sticks to that old saying “tight is right” and continues to play only the very top of their range.
For that reason, this guide is designed to help you crush the nits in your games and ensure that you never have trouble with this player profile again.
But before we can look into particular strategy adjustments to use against nits, let’s examine what poker nits are, how they play the game, and what you can expect from them.
Poker nits are players who adopt an extremely tight and cautious playing style, engaging only with premium hands and avoiding marginal situations. While this approach can be profitable against loose opponents, it becomes a liability against observant and aggressive players.Key Strategies to Exploit Nits:* Steal Their Blinds Relentlessly: Nits often fold their blinds to raises, especially from late positions. Exploit this by raising with a wide range when they’re in the blinds.* 3-Bet Light Against Late-Position Opens: When nits open from the cutoff or button, they may have a wider range. Re-raising (3-betting) with a broader range can pressure them into folding.* Float Flops and Bet Turns: Nits tend to continuation bet (c-bet) the flop but give up on the turn if they don’t improve. Call their flop bets with the intention to bet the turn when they check.* Double Barrel on Scare Cards: If a scare card (like an Ace) appears on the turn, and the nit shows weakness, a second bet can often force them to fold medium-strength hands.* Check-Raise the River When They Show Weakness: If a nit checks the turn and then bets a non-threatening river, a check-raise can exploit their tendency to bet-fold with marginal hands.By recognizing and exploiting the predictable patterns of nits, you can turn their cautious approach into a profitable opportunity.
The term “nit” was coined long ago by live poker players to describe someone playing the game in a particularly snug position.
Poker nits play very tight before the flop, often only entering pots with the top 10% of the best starting hands and even tighter than that in early positions at the table.
A true nit will easily find a fold UTG with pocket nines, will not call a raise with KQ, and will never 3-bet AQ, while usually only flat-calling a hand like TT, JJ, or AK as well.
With such a tight range, nits really aren’t a problem in more than 80% of all the hands since all they do is fold their cards without seeing a flop. However, they do still enter some pots, and when they do they also play in a very particular way that can be easily exploited.
A poker nit plays poker “in a vacuum” and often does not care who he is up against. He is willing to fold big hands like AA when the board gets scary and will easily give up on bluffing, even with a strong draw.
So, now that you know what a nit in poker is, let’s take a look at some potential strategy adjustments that you can make to start printing money when facing nits.
Some poker pros have gained a reputation for being on the “nitty-er” side.
I said that I was going to discuss all the ways you can crush nits in your poker games, and a part of that strategy has to do with making sure you don’t value own yourself.
A nit’s opening range is very tight, and it becomes even tighter in early positions (EP), to the point where some nits only open AQ+ and JJ+ from early seats.
Against a range like this, you need to be very careful not to put more money into the pot than you have to, which means 3-betting a nit’s EP raise is usually a recipe for disaster.
Instead, what you can do is call such a raise with quite a few speculative hands, banking on both hitting big hands to get paid on some boards and being able to bluff the nit out on others.
However, remember that a hand like 66 or 87s has very little equity going up against pocket aces or KK, so even if you will win some pots by calling a nit’s EP raise, simply staying out of the way in such situations is often the best play.
If you are given a chance to see the flop somewhat cheap, and you have a reasonable hand, you can peel that flop but don’t bank too much on getting AA to fold on later streets.
Do not take a nit’s preflop raising range lightly, it is usually quite strong.
Most players know to defend their blinds wide, but poker nits are well behind the times, and this is not an adjustment they have made.
For that reason, a nit’s big blind is more or less free money, as most nits only defend the big blind with less than 25% of all hands, and their small blind even less.
This means that anytime a nit is in the big blind, especially in tournaments, you get to raise with a much wider range than you normally do and make a direct profit from the nit folding too much.
Even when the nit does decide to defend his big blind, he will not be as sticky after the flop as most other players. A nit will routinely chuck the second pair into the muck postflop on many boards, and a simple c-bet will be enough to take it down most of the time.
Stealing the nit’s blinds is the best way to keep making money from having him at the table, as his general involvement, on the other hand, is very limited.
While your button preflop raising range should be wide,it can be even wider when facing nits in the blinds.
As I already discussed, early position raises from nits are usually reserved for the very best of hands, which means you should not get too involved too much in such situations. However, as the nit’s position shifts, he will begin opening a wider range.
On the cutoff or button, a nit will open suited Broadways, suited connectors, and middling pairs for a standard raise. However, the one thing a nit is not equipped to properly deal with is 3-bets, which is why he is the perfect candidate to re-steal from.
When a nit opens the button, you can easily get away with re-raising him with a wide range of suited hands, expecting quite a few folds right away.
While most players will defend against 3-bets quite wide in position, a nit will only play the face value of his cards and often fold hands like 98s to a 3-bet, giving you instant profit.
When a nit does call your re-raise, a simple c-bet will often take it on the flop. You may even win against a hand like JJ or QQ when an A or K hits the flop and the nit decides to give up.
Playing against nits is very different than playing against other poker players like calling stations, so make sure to always keep in mind the type of player you are going up against.
Apply pressure on nits by 3-betting their late position raises.
There is nothing scarier to a nit than a board made up of a bunch of low cards in suits he does not have, and when playing them live, you will be able to see their discomfort in real-time.
When playing pots against nits, you should be very aware of how linear their range tends to be and what types of boards don’t interact with it at all.
For example, a nit raising in the early or middle position will have very little, if any interaction with a board like 6♥5♥2♦ or 9♣7♣6♥, making both boards ideal to take the pot away from him.
While the unit will always have some nut flush draw combos on boards like this, these draws and overpairs are the only hands you need to worry about.
What’s even more, further scare cards may help you win the pot even against an overpair, while the flush draws will usually give up when they miss.
Floating c-bets on a board like this and going for a bluff on later streets is the recipe for success against the nit, who will be very uncomfortable calling big bets even with AA once further cards connect with the low board.
Use favorable boards to apply pressure on the nit.
Unlike LAGs or TAGs, poker nits tend not to be very studied poker players but rather old-school players who learned how to play the game on the go.
There isn’t really too much method to their play, and their entire strategy is predicated on the idea of avoiding losing big pots while winning some small ones along the way to break a small profit.
The problem with that strategy in a game like No Limit Hold’em is that we, their opponents, have a chance to bet big and bet often, and this goes directly against the nit’s desire to stay out of big pots.
So, when playing against a nit, you can often win the pot with pure aggression. Making big bets with your draws or relatively weak hands will often make them fold top pair or better, as he is afraid of monsters.
This isn’t to say that you should try to bluff the nit out every chance you get, as their range will often be so strong, but when you do try to win a pot off him, you should make sure to bet big and with confidence, as that’s the one thing nits are most afraid of.
Poker nits are perhaps the easiest poker players to play against, as they tend to play their hands without much balance or disguise, often advertising the strength in advance. A poker nit will play his big hands very aggressively while playing everything else passively and just calling, helping you narrow down his range much more precisely.
Nits are very afraid of big bets, which is why you should utilize them when bluffing, and this should be your plan anytime the board does not work well with the nit’s range, even if your hand isn’t particularly good.
Your game plan against nits in poker should be far away from what GTO strategy recommends, as the ranges they will call your bets differ wildly from what a solver assumes for an average player.
So, the next time you play with a nit at the table, remember the strategy tips we gave you here and try to apply them in real time.
You will notice the nit get out of your way and let you win all pots but the very few in which he makes the nuts, which you should be able to sniff out by bet sizing and overall player behavior in such situations.
### TOPIC: playing against wide ranges 1
It’s no secret that most poker players play too many hands preflop. In fact, you probably play too many hands preflop. There are great treatment programs for this ailment, but this is not one of them. I am here to tell you how to exploit the people whose preflop ranges are too wide, and aren’t even in recovery.
I want to briefly discuss the reasons why people choose to play a hand, rather than fold, preflop:
Many low-stakes players have a “see the flop” range – a set of hands that want to see the first three community cards. Such players are, within reason, inelastic about the cost of their ticket to the flop.
Make the best preflop decisions with Jonathan Little’s Push/Fold Charts!
If the other players at our table are seeing too many flops, that is costing them money. You can’t have a VPIP of 70% and be profitable – you just whiff way too many flops and burn your preflop investment. Because poker is a zero-sum game, if our opponents are losing money by playing too many hands, then it becomes available to us. How do we capitalize on that error and maximize our profit from it?
I’m going to say something shocking and controversial here: position is important.
Okay, it’s neither shocking nor controversial, but like all important lessons, it bears repeating. In this particular case, it’s important because
The people who benefit most from opponents playing too many hands are those who act behind them.
Let’s suppose you’re playing $1/$2 no-limit hold’em. You open A♦K♠ to $8 UTG+1, and a middle position player calls with Q♥4♥. Despite your hand being much stronger than theirs, this is not particularly advantageous for you, because that player will act after you throughout the hand. In fact, the players who most benefit from that player’s overly loose call are the ones between them and the button, should they enter the pot. Conversely, if you are in the hijack seat, that same player limps with the same Q♥4♥, and you raise to $8 with A♦K♠, this is a great situation for you.
In fact, the power balance has shifted sufficiently that you can open bigger in later positions, particularly when there have been limpers in front of you. A “standard” recommendation is to open to three big blinds, plus one extra for each limper in front of you. If your opponents are playing too many hands (and most do) you can open bigger in late position. I suggest 4x or even 5x plus one for each limper. In our $1/$2 example, I would open to $10 or $12.
This will work as long as (a) your opponents continue to call with weak ranges, and (b) you don’t fear frequent 3-bets. These conditions hold for almost all low stakes live games, so I encourage you to experiment with these larger sizings.
Note, by the way, that you’re giving away no hand strength information with this strategy. If I see that Martha opens to 3x UTG+1, but 5x in the cutoff, she’s given me nothing about her hand strength.

Don’t freak out. I know that almost all reputable training sites and no-limit hold’em coaches encourage students to never limp. That is great advice, particularly for beginning or weaker students. Why? Because so many poker players have a “see the flop” range, because folding is boring – all the reasons that I mentioned above. Giving a student permission to limp under any circumstances can quickly be misapplied as permission to limp under a lot of circumstances.
I’m going to give you credit for not misapplying this advice.
Suppose you are in a game where the most common preflop scenario is a single raise, with multiple players seeing the flop. This dynamic frequently exists in low stakes live games:
Sound familiar? If so, there are two types of hands with which you might choose to limp:
These are the hands that are traditionally limp/reraising candidates. In a tight game, an early position player waking up with KK might fear that if they raise, everybody will fold, and they’ll win nothing but the blinds. So they limp, hoping for a raise behind them. Then they come over the top with a limp/reraise.
This is particularly effective in the kinds of games I just described. You are in a $2/$5 game with $500 stacks, and limp UTG+1 with K♥K♣. Now UTG+2 makes it $20, gets two calls behind them, and the big blind calls as well. You make it $150. This puts any hand but aces in a no-win situation. They can fold, lose their $20 investment, and their equity in the pot, or call, taking very much the worse of it. If anybody does call, there will be almost $400 in the pot with $350 behind – you can jam on any non-ace flop.
“But wait, Lee – if I do that, I’m turning my hand face-up. Nobody limp/re-raises with anything but the premiums.” Well, first, you are allowed to limp/re-raise with non-premiums, and we’ll get to that in a minute. But also, what are they going to do about it? Suppose they know you have a premium pair? The damage has already been done for the three players who called the initial raise. This is the one of the penalties that loose players pay for calling raises too wide. When a 3-bet comes in, they’ve already invested four BBs, and can either burn that investment, or send another $130 to chase after the original $20. Neither option is attractive, so you win either way.
That’s enough for now. To keep this article a readable length, I’m going to break it into two pieces – but you can read the second half here. For now, let’s briefly summarize what we’ve learned so far:
We’ve covered the first class of hands that you might limp in early position – the premium hands such as pocket aces, pocket kings, and AK. We will get to the next class of limpable hands in the next installment.
### TOPIC: playing against wide ranges 2
In the first installment of Three Ways to Punish Wide Preflop Ranges, we discussed how poker players see too many flops, and began to review how to exploit that mistake. I said that one thing you can do is limp with certain classes of hands in early position. The first group of hands I suggested is the “classics” – AA-QQ and AK. The ones that you’re used to seeing people limp/re-raise in early position. Or maybe even limp/call if they want to be extra tricky (i.e. unwise).
The next category of hands you might limp is one you may not expect – let’s look at it now.
Think about hands such as 7♥7♦ and T♦9♦. These hands can flop well, but don’t do well if they open, but are faced with a raft of callers behind them. Let’s say you’re in a $1/$3 game, open 8♣8♠ to $10 in early position, and get four callers. Unless you flop a set, you’re unlikely to win the hand. But it sure would be nice to go set-mining with that hand. So you can consider limping for $3, and seeing what transpires behind you. If there’s a raise and a 3-bet, you fold. If there’s a single reasonable raise, then you can safely call. If there is no raise, and the big blind checks, you’ve gotten to mine your set for the best possible price.
The same is true of a hand such as T♦9♦. The difference with T9s is that its most frequent way of hitting the flop is with a draw, rather than a made hand (88 flops a set or it doesn’t).
And this is where the hands diverge in terms of how you respond to a raise after you’ve limped in. With 77, it’s best to call, assuming that the raise is small enough that you can appropriately set-mine. You can also call with your T9s, again, if the raise is small and the stacks are deep enough.
In short, you are paying one big blind with these speculative hands for the privilege of seeing what happens behind you.
Make the best preflop decisions with Jonathan Little’s Push/Fold Charts!
Remember you were concerned about turning your KK face-up by limp/3betting it preflop? While you should definitely not limp/3-bet all of your T9s kinds of hands, you can take a very small fraction of those and treat them as if they were KK.
When you have 77 and continue putting chips in the pot after the flop, it’s usually because you’ve flopped a set. This is particularly true in a multi-way pot. Suppose you’re playing $2/$5 hold’em with $500 stacks. You limp UTG with 77, the lojack makes it $25, the cutoff cold-calls, and you call as well. The flop comes K-7-4 rainbow. You check, the lojack bets $40, the cutoff calls, and now you can put in a hefty check/raise to $150, setting up a turn jam.
But if you don’t flop a set, you’re basically done with the hand.
Conversely, T9s will be doing a lot of bluffing on flops where it continues. As I discussed in my article about suited connectors,  such hands make great bluffing hands, as opposed to “call and get there” hands.
Because you will be doing a lot of bluffing when you continue with a hand such as T9s, it is advantageous to be able to represent an uncapped range with a suited connector on the flop.
Thus you don’t need to turn your 77 into a bluff preflop. But on rare occasions, you can turn your T9s into a bluff. If everybody thinks that you have kings, and folds, that’s a great outcome. But if you get a caller or two, now you can continue on favorable flops with the specter of your holding KK still hanging over their heads.
Again, don’t overuse this play. You don’t get KK (or better) very often, so if you start limp/3-betting all those hands plus all your suited connectors, you will quickly lose credibility. So pick a tiny subset (“Today is T♥9♥and 9♣8♣ day”) and play those like a premium pair preflop.
Also, your informational limp may give you some unexpected opportunities. You are in a $1/3 game with $300 stacks, and limp UTG+1 with 9♠8♠. It is not on the limp/3-bet list today, so you plan to call a reasonable raise behind you. But then the unexpected happens. There are three limpers behind you for $3 each, and now a loose-aggressive player in the cutoff makes it $25. The action folds back to you.
You might consider promoting your hand to the limp/3-bet category. Presumably the others who limped have weak ranges. And the loose-aggro player may well be pouncing on all that seemingly dead money with a weak holding. If you have a tight image, and haven’t made the limp/3-bet play today, think about making it $110 to go. Expect insta-folds from the other limpers, and for the cutoff to fold often enough to make your play quite profitable. If they do call, maybe you’ll flop a bunch of equity, and can just shove the flop for less than a pot-size bet.
Always be on the lookout for such opportunities.
Two reminders:
Let Jonathan Little teach you how to bluff like the pros!
I have always been taught – and always teach – to keep tough players on your right. It is tiring to have your raises often 3-bet by a tough player on your left. And in general, it’s no fun playing out of position against a competent opponent.
However, if you have an opponent who is VPIPing absurdly high – 60% or more – then you want them on your right. Why? Remember our original thesis: the money that players lose by VPIPing too many hands preflop largely goes to those people acting behind them. The more that you act after such players, the more of their losses flow in your direction.
In fact,
Sitting behind a player with a VPIP of 80% is more important than sitting behind a tough aggressive player.
This goes counter to everything we’ve learned about position. But after all, that 80 VPIP player will be in the pot on 80% of hands, frequently with absolute junk. You gain enormous EV by playing pots in-position against them. Conversely, the tough aggressive player will be in relatively few pots – they’re not getting in there with trash. So yes, it’s annoying when you raise, the tough player 3-bets, and you have to fold. But that will be rare compared to the times you’ll be able to raise a good hand behind a limp from the weak player, and play a pot in-position against their wide range.
Remember, no matter what you do, players who VPIP too much are losing money, and the rest of the table is going to share it. Using these techniques allows you to collect more than a fair share of all that free money.
### TOPIC: playing different table positions
Poker position is one of the most important concepts in poker and one that some players neglect. You will often see inexperienced poker players limp in, call raises, and raise themselves from random positions at the table with a very wide range of hands simply because they don’t understand the importance of the position.
Yet, the importance of position cannot be overstated. It is one of the key components of any basic poker strategy, and knowing how to play every position well is key to becoming a successful poker player.
In this article, we will discuss the importance of position in poker, explain the different poker positions, and look at some major strategic implications of playing from different positions.
Position in poker refers to where you sit relative to the dealer and how that impacts the order in which you act during a hand. Being in a “late position” (closer to the dealer button) is a powerful advantage because it allows you to see how other players act before making your decision. Early positions require tighter hand ranges because you’re at a disadvantage, while later positions allow for wider and more aggressive play due to increased information. Mastering position helps improve decision-making, control pot size, and exploit weaker players more effectively. It’s one of the most fundamental aspects of a strong poker strategy.
Before we can discuss any specifics, we must explain what a poker position is and how we determine it.
The actual seat you have decided to take at the table does not matter for poker position, as every player gets to play every position exactly once per orbit.
Instead, your poker position in hand is determined relative to the position of the dealer button, which moves by one spot to the left of every hand.
Generally speaking, poker positions can be grouped up in the following way:
Each of these position groups requires a different preflop and postflop strategy, with tighter play generally recommended in earlier positions and more active play recommended in later seats.
Now that you understand the concept, let’s take a more detailed look at all the positions you can find yourself in and discuss the basic strategic implications.
Which position do you struggle with playing the most? Position in poker is extremely powerful. Knowing which hands to play from each position will allow for fewer mistakes on later streets. ?? pic.twitter.com/o2drDgF4P7
The table positions to the very left of the blinds are called early seats. Typically speaking, the two players sitting next to the blinds are considered to be in an early position.
The first position to the left of the big blind is called “Under the Gun” (UTG) and is the least favorable preflop position of them all. The player to UTG’s left is labeled UTG+1.
At a 6-handed table, only these two players are considered to be in early position, while in full ring games, the player to the left of UTG+1 can also be considered an EP player.
Playing from UTG or UTG+1 means you will always be the first player entering the pot, with everyone else still left to act behind you.
Being in an early position means you still have the whole table left to act behind you, and there is a high chance that one of the other players actually has a big hand.
With this in mind, it is important to play a tight range of hands from an early position, consisting mostly of very strong holdings and a few speculative hands for balance.
You will still want to open all big pairs, all big aces, and suited Broadway cards. However, you should be folding most of your offsuit hands and various suited connectors and gappers apart from the premium ones.
While this kind of approach might seem too tight, and folding 87 suited from UTG might seem like an overkill, this is definitely the strategy that works best from an early position.
Moving further to the left, we arrive at the middle position. Typically speaking, the two positions to the left of UTG+1 are considered middle positions in full-ring games, while the one position to the left of UTG+1 is considered middle position in 6-Max games.
Labeled as Lojack (LJ) and Hijack (HJ), these positions give you a bit more liberty than UTG and UTG+1, although the distinction becomes less impactful in 6-Max games, where Hijack also acts as UTG+1.
As you move further away from UTG, your opening range can become a bit wider as fewer players are left to get through.
With fewer opponents left to act, the odds of someone sitting behind you with a monster or playing back at you go down.
Yet, the middle position still doesn’t offer too much wiggle room, as you must still play a reasonably tight preflop range.
Introducing all pocket pairs, some additional suited aces, and an occasional suited connector to your range is acceptable, but opening much wider than this is usually not a good idea.
This brings us to the late position at a poker table, the place you want to be seated. Two positions are considered LP in both 6-Max and full-ring games: the Cutoff (CU) and Dealer Button (D).
While both positions are considered as LP, it is worth noting that the Dealer position is infinitely more profitable than Cutoff, as it guarantees you will be in position for all remaining streets, regardless of other players’ actions.
Playing in LP is much easier than playing in other positions, as your postflop advantage allows you much looser preflop play and a lot more room for fancy moves.
As you move into late position at the table, you will start opening up your range significantly, adding a variety of suited hands, offsuit connectors, and more to your raising range.
What’s even more, you will often be faced with early or middle position raises or limps when you are in LP, and you will have the ability to apply pressure, steal pots away with 3-bets, or call to see flops in position.
Being in position, especially on the button, will allow you to play more hands profitably and outplay your opponents on every street to follow.
For this reason, it is very important to play aggressively from the late position and take the initiative in hand before the flop is even dealt.
If you do it right, your ability to over-realize your equity when playing in position will make late position play a money-making machine.
The final two positions at any poker table are the blinds. The Small Blind (SB) and Big Blind (BB) are the only two players who must put money into the pot without looking at their cards.
Being in the blinds puts you at a significant disadvantage, as you are forced to invest money with random cards.
What’s even more, you will play every following street out of position, which is what makes blinds play one of the most complicated elements of the game of poker.
When you are seated in the blinds, you will see the entire table act before the action is on you. It is worth noting that there is a significant advantage between being in the SB and the BB.
As an SB player, you will sometimes have the opportunity to attack the BB as all other players will fold. This is especially common in 6-Max play.
When the pot is unopened in the SB, you should play with a wide range, as you only need to get through one player to steal the blinds.
If you face raises from one of the players who acted before, you will usually be well advised to 3-bet or fold, as calling in SB leads to several major problems.
For starters, you will play the entire hand out of position 100% of the time. Furthermore, calling gives the BB a good price on an overcall, which makes the pot 3-way instead of heads up. Finally, the BB is incentivized to 3-bet as a steal more often with a wider range but will always have a position on you if you call.
By always 3-betting or folding in the SB, you will play fewer pots against two players, not be exploited by the BB who knows you don’t have a monster hand, and win many pots right then and there.
Your BB strategy should consist of many calls against small raises from early and late positions, mixed in with a few 3-bets with your strongest hands and best bluffing candidates.
You will have to play the hand out of position against most players from the BB, but the amazing pot odds you will often get before the flop still make it a good idea to defend wide.
The above diagram displays the names of each position in a 9-handed poker game.
If poker was played 100% before the flop, poker position would play a much smaller role. However, there are three betting rounds to come after the preflop, and the bets in these keep getting bigger and bigger.
Positional advantage is priceless, as it allows you to collect information, control the size of the pot, and realize more of your equity in each hand.
Playing out of position, you will be in complete darkness as to the way other players connected with the flop, giving you a distinct disadvantage in that betting round.
Moving into the turn and river, you will always have to act first, which will make it harder to bluff, harder to bluff catch, and harder to get away from losing hands.
The decisions you made before the flop will start compounding with each passing street. Opening too wide from EP, for example, will lead to some terrible spots on turns and rivers, making you regret ever being in hand.
Of course, you will need to learn how to navigate both in-position (IP) and out-of-position (OOP) scenarios if you want to become a complete Texas Hold’em player, but you should always remember that you want to play way more pots in position than out of it.
Having a position over your opponents is one of the biggest advantages you can have at a poker table, and there are several reasons for it.
We have already touched on some of the reasons being in position is better, but let’s take a slightly more detailed look at some of the key advantages of playing in position:
#1. Act Last: Acting last in a hand is a massive advantage. You get to see your opponent’s actions and adapt to them in any way that benefits you.
#2. Pot Control: By being last to act, you will have a chance to control the size of the pot. Calling instead of raising, skipping bets, and making bets of the size you prefer are all some of the ways you can control the pot size.
#3. Take Free Cards: When playing OOP, you are sometimes forced to bet with draws, as you don’t want to be priced out of the pot by your opponent betting. IP, you will often get to check behind and take a free card, allowing you to draw for free or protect yourself against check-raises.
#4. Extra Value: Being in position will allow you to make thin value bets that might seem dangerous OOP. Once your opponent has checked the river, their range will often be capped.
#5. Close the Action: If there are no players to act behind you, you know you are closing the action. Making a multi-way call with a drawing hand will be easier, as you know you won’t get squeezed out.
Mastering concepts like playing in position can help you win money and trophies at the poker table.
There are many concepts to learn about in poker, but poker position is easily one of the most important ones. Knowing how to play in different positions will help you make better decisions before and after the flop and ultimately win more money in your games.
It may take some time to completely adjust to playing differently from each position, but the results you will get from it are well worth it.
Start studying positional GTO poker strategy today, one position at a time, and we can promise you your results will improve as your positional awareness increases, and you make more correct plays from each position at the table.
Position in poker refers to a player’s relative position compared to the dealer button and other positions at the table. Each player at the table has a position in each hand, and these positions rotate clockwise with each new hand. In one orbit of play, each player gets to play once in every position.
There can be up to ten positions at a poker table, although modern games are typically played with up to eight or nine players. The first three positions, called early positions, are UTG (under the gun), UTG+1, and UTG+2. The middle positions are LJ (lojack), and HJ (hijack). The two late positions are CU (cutoff) and BTN (button). The final two positions are SB (small blind) and BB (big blind).
Being in position means playing last after the flop. If you are seated on the dealer button, you will always have a position against all other players at the table. In all other situations, you will only have a position if other players who have a position on you fold their cards.
Being out of position means acting first after the flop. The player in the small blind always acts first on the flop, turn, and river, which means they are always out of position against all other players. In all other situations, you will be out of position if you are facing action from one of the players who have a position on you.
The best position in poker is the dealer button (BTN). When seated in this position, you are guaranteed to play last on the flop, turn, and river, as you are in position against all other players. Playing in position allows you to over-realize your equity, exert pressure, and control the size of the pot, all of which give you a significant advantage over other players at the table.
The dealer button is a button that signifies the “dealer” in a poker game. The player holding this button has position on all other players in the hand and will get to play last on all streets starting with the flop. This is the most favorable position in poker, which is why you can play a significantly wider range of hands from it.
The small blind and big blind are the two forced bets in Texas Hold’em Poker. The two players to the left of the dealer button must post these bets before the cards are dealt. These two positions must play first on the flop, turn, and river, which makes them the least favorable positions at the poker table.
### TOPIC: playing overpairs oop
Like most things in life, even a seemingly simple poker question can require dramatic refining and nuance before anybody can provide a useful answer. Thus, “How should I play an overpair, out-of-position (“OP”) in cash games?”, while a reasonable question, doesn’t have a simple answer.
In fact, rather than answer this question, I will propose some further questions that you should ask. The answers to these questions will guide you in deciding how to play in your particular situation.
But before we dive into the questions, there’s an unfortunate truth which we must accept:
Because we are out-of-position, we are at a disadvantage throughout the hand. This shadow will hang over every decision we make.
Okay, with that reminder, let’s push forward. How do we make the best of an inarguably bad situation?
The more opponents you have, the more passively and honestly you must play. Suppose you raise preflop from the UTG+1 position, and get three callers, all of whom will act after you post-flop. Let’s further stipulate that you manage to have an overpair after the flop. Note that I haven’t said whether you have K-K or 8-8. At some level, it’s not terribly important, because you have what Carlos Welch likes to call, “The second worst hand in poker – one pair.”
When you play a heads-up pot after the flop, the equity in the pot is shared by just two players. But with your three opponents, four of you are sharing the pot equity. Because we’ve stipulated that you have an overpair, you are currently losing to all hands two-pair or better. Of course, having K♦-K♣ on a Q♣-8♣-2♥ flop is much better than having 8♠-8♣ on a 6♥-5♥-2♥ flop, though both are “overpairs.” But even with the kings, you have to beat all three opponents to win the pot.
Furthermore, the opponent(s) with the strongest hand will be self-selected to continue putting money in the pot. So it’s as if all three of them are implicitly colluding to find the one who has the best chance to knock your cowboys off their horse.
The fact is that if you reach the flop 3-4 (or more) ways, one pair – even kings – isn’t much of a hand. It might still be good, but you’ll have difficulty knowing that, and particularly being out-of-position, you’re facing an uphill battle to get to a showdown.
The solution to this mess? Do a lot of checking, and when you do bet, bet small. The premium pairs often get us into the most trouble in these big multi-way pots because of “entitlement tilt.” That’s the idea that “dammit, our kings were the best hand before the flop, it’s been 90 minutes since I’ve seen a hand this good, and I am going to just bet it until everybody calls with worse or folds.”
But if one of your three opponents flopped two-pair, they don’t care that you had the best hand pre-flop, and they’re going to call all your bets.
A related phenomenon is the idea that you have to bet big to “protect” your hand. Let’s say that you raise K♥-K♦ UTG+1, and get three callers. The flop comes Q♠-8♥-2♠. A lot of players think, “Oh, I have to bet big to knock out the draws and protect my hand.” You should be more worried about protecting your stack. By betting big, you’re not protecting against straight and flush draws – you’re merely bloating a pot you aren’t favored to win, and setting yourself up for no-win decisions on later streets.
Accept that with an increasing number of people seeing the flop, the likelihood of you winning the pot goes down. Out of position, tread carefully, and be ready to get out when it becomes apparent that one of your opponents has passed you.

The SPR is simply the ratio between the effective remaining stack and the size of the pot. If there’s $60 in the pot, and the shortest remaining stack is $150, then the SPR is 2.5. As the SPR shrinks, the value of a single pair, while it is still the second-worst hand in poker, goes up dramatically. Let’s look at a couple of extreme examples:
You’re playing $1/3 NLH. A player in early position raises to $12, and gets four callers (this isn’t as rare as you might think). You find K♣-K♦ in the small blind, and make it $100 (a quite reasonable raise). Everybody but a cold-caller in the lojack folds, creating a pot of about $250. By the way, congratulations on your raise sizing – narrowing the field from six to two is a huge win. You had started with $300, and now have $200 behind. The single caller started with $300 as well. So the SPR is 0.8 going to the flop, which is J♠-4♦-T♠. There are various ways of getting the money in, but you are never folding.
You may be the one who drives the betting, or your opponent may do it. Stacks may go in, or not. But whatever happens, do not fold your kings in a heads-up pot that saw a jack-high flop with an SPR of 0.8.
Now, let’s revisit this same hand, but we’re going to move you and all your table-mates to Texas. Everything is the same, except, because Texas, everybody started with $1500 instead of $300. There’s the same preflop action, the same J♠-4♦-T♠ flop comes down, and you have the same overpair of kings, but now the SPR is 5.6. If all remaining $1400 from each of the two remaining players goes into the middle, either your kings are crushed by a set or two-pair, or you are in a dead heat against a hand such as A♠-Q♠. Furthermore, your hand has little opportunity to improve – an overpair usually arrives at the river as one pair.
Deeper stacks favor the in-position (IP) player, so when you’re OP, an SPR of 5.6 is a huge disadvantage for you. You might choose to check this flop and “play from the defensive side of the tree,” as the theorists put it. That is, acknowledge your disadvantage in the situation, and at least initially, let your opponent do the betting. If they check back the flop, then the balance of power has swung back toward you and you can begin betting.
Even if they do bet, that’s not the end of the world. By checking, you’ve under-represented the strength of your hand, and potentially induced bluffs and value bets from weaker hands, such as Q-J. You can now profitably call down with your kings on many run-outs.
But that said, when stacks are deep, a hand that was clearly best preflop is now on unstable ground and must proceed carefully. Bluntly put, there will be many run-outs where you have to fold your overpair at or before the river.
Think back to the preflop action, and consider the board texture. The whole topic of range/nut advantage is far too complex to review here, but some boards favor the preflop raiser (or 3-bettor), while others favor preflop callers (or a raiser who called a 3-bet). If you have the range and nut advantage, you can bet more frequently.
Suppose you are playing $2/5 NLH and open K♠-K♥ in the UTG+1 position to $20. Only the hijack player calls. The flop comes 7♥-6♦-3♦. You still have the range advantage, because you can have all the big pairs (e.g. JJ+) and your opponent would have normally 3-bet those. However, your opponent has the nut advantage, because they can have hands such as 5-5, 3-3, and the occasional 7-6 or 5-4 suited – you rarely have those hands.
Not all of your opponents will be able to recognize the nut advantage that they have with this flop, but those that do can put you in some rough spots. If you bet big and get raised, your opponent is threatening to put entire stacks in the middle – you do not want to play for (e.g.) 150 BB stacks with pocket kings on this board.
While you can’t “pot control” from out-of-position (your opponent always has the option of putting money in on this street), you can choose to not bloat the pot, and see if and how much your opponent wants to bet.
Read one of the highest regarded articles on the PokerCoaching.com blog: The Bankroll Bible
The title of this article is about “playing overpairs out of position.” However, the elephant in the middle of the room is that not all overpairs are created equal. I alluded to this elsewhere, but this question shines a light on the elephant. If you have Q-Q on a T-7-3 rainbow flop, there’s a “decent” chance that your pocket queens will still look fairly strong by the river. No promises, of course – poker is short on those – but you might get two, perhaps three streets of value from your hand.
Conversely, suppose you have 8♥-8♣ on a 7♦-5♦-2♠ flop. Sure, you have an overpair, but it’s long odds against you feeling great about your hand by the river. Cards lower than your eights all but promise straights and two-pairs. Cards above your eights – well, you know the problem with those. And a diamond could easily spell doom.
Somewhat counter-intuitively, you might choose to bet the 8-8 more frequently than the Q-Q, simply because it benefits more from getting value now and protection than the queens do. However, the admonition to bet small still holds – if you bet, you must bet small.
The most important thing you can do to play overpairs well when out-of-position is to acknowledge two important weaknesses in your situation:
Particularly with the big premium pairs, these can be two hard pills to swallow, but swallow them you must. Once you’ve done that:
In closing, let me leave you with a sobering screenshot from GTOWizard. This is a solution for a situation where you have raised in the UTG position, and been called by the cutoff. The flop is 7♥-6-♦-3♦. The equilibrium solution has you checking 94% of the time. It would be perfectly reasonable to “check range” here – that is, check all your hands. Even our example premium hand – K-K – is checking 88% of the time.
Even the Machine, which knows nothing of fear or anxiety, is keeping its head down. Let that be a lesson to you as you navigate the choppy waters of an overpair, out of position.
### TOPIC: playing pocket pairs
Pocket pairs are the strongest hand category in Texas Hold’em, as they give you a chance to start with a made hand, improve into monsters like sets and full houses, and have a significant equity edge over most other hands.
The best hands in the game, such as AA, KK, and QQ, fall into this category, and these are the hands you want to see more than anything else at the poker table.
Despite being so strong, pocket pairs are often misplayed and misunderstood. While some players overplay small pocket pairs like 44, others don’t get nearly enough value for the likes of JJ or QQ.
In this article, we explore the value of different pocket pairs and look into the best strategies to play them and maximize your profits across the board.
One of the things many novices stumble upon is overestimating the value of their small pocket pairs or being too cautious with the higher ones.
If you want to maximize your profits with pocket pairs, you must categorize them and play accordingly instead of treating every pair the same.
On a most basic level, you can classify your pocket pairs as:
Premium pocket pairs include hands like AA, KK, QQ, and JJ. These hands are the best starting hands you can get in Texas Hold’em and should always be played aggressively and for maximum value.
Playing against competent opponents, you should have no fear of getting all the chips in with these hands, and this is especially true for AA and KK.
When playing with QQ and JJ, your decisions past a 3-bet should depend quite a bit on the player you are up against, and there will be some marginal decisions in play.
Middle pocket pairs include pairs like 66, 77, 88, 99, and TT, although TT can also be considered a premium in short-handed poker games.
These pocket pairs gain value when few players are at the table or in heads-up matches, but they should be played more carefully in a full-ring setting.
Small pocket pairs, like 22, 33, 44, and 55, are great stealing hands and can turn into absolute monsters when they connect with the flop.
However, overplaying small pocket pairs for too many big blinds can be a disaster and is something you should avoid in most cases.
Before we delve deeper into how to play each pocket pair category, let’s take a look at some basic pocket pair math and the basic odds you need to know.
The math behind pocket pairs in poker is often misunderstood, as players tend to overestimate or underestimate the basic pot odds related to them.
For starters, you should know that there are exactly 6 combinations of each pocket pair in the game out of 1,326 overall combinations.
That means that only 78 out of 1,326 combos are pocket pairs, while all others are unpaired offsuit or suited hands.
That makes for precisely 1 out of 17 hands or a 5.9% chance of being dealt any pocket pair to start with. Things get a lot more extreme when you look at the odds of being dealt a particular pocket pair, as you will only get that 1 out of 220 times, for a total of 0.45%.
If you are playing a live poker game and getting frustrated about not getting dealt aces, remember that you should only get AA once every 220 hands, which can take over 5 hours in a live poker environment.
Here is a quick table to remind you of the basic odds of getting dealt pocket pairs in Texas Hold’em:
As you can see, getting dealt a pocket pair in poker is not easy, but once you do get one, you should be looking to maximize your value with it.
In order to do that, you should also know how likely your pocket pair is to improve, as this is a key thing to understand, especially with smaller pocket pairs.
Small pocket pairs don’t have too much value on their own but can turn into real monsters once they improve into a set or a full house.
The following list details how likely that is to happen:
Premium pocket pairs are the strongest hand category in the game. This category includes AA and KK, two of the best hands in the game, along with QQ and JJ.
All four of these pocket pairs are considered proper monsters, and professional poker players are usually willing to bet it all when they have one of these hands.
One key thing to remember is that AA and KK are true premiums, while QQ and JJ are a notch weaker. This is mainly because they are only barely ahead of AK in terms of equity, and AK is a hand that often gets involved against them in big pots.
Whenever you are dealt AA or KK, you should play very aggressively from all positions and be willing to go broke no matter what, even if multiple players put their chips in.
With QQ and JJ, on the other hand, you may be able to find some folds as stacks get deeper or if more than one opponent shows extreme interest in the pot.
In tournament poker, premium pocket pairs are the hands that make you a ton of money, as players often try to steal pots and end up jamming into your premiums.
In deeper stacked cash games, premium pocket pairs become trickier to play, as getting all the chips in before the flop becomes increasingly difficult.
Playing your premium pocket pairs in tricky ways every now and then can prove massively profitable in deep-stacked games, while playing them more straightforwardly for value usually works better in tournament poker.
The very best of premiums, like AA and KK, can be used as trapping hands against very aggressive players who are likely to stack off on a wide variety of boards and at high frequency.
Middle pocket pairs can put poker players in many difficult situations. They look pretty but are also quite vulnerable.
The way you play your middle pairs should depend heavily on your stack size, your position, and the actions of other players at the table.
In cash games with deep stacks, middle pocket pairs are good enough to open from all positions and usually good enough to call a 3-bet with as well, provided you will have position after the flop.
However, they are not hands you want to commit a 100 big blind stack with before the flop, as they are never really ahead of any range of hands that plays aggressively preflop.
In tournament poker, where stacks tend to get much smaller, middle pocket pairs gain a lot of value as they become the perfect candidates to re-steal against late position opens.
Shoving 25 big blinds over a small raise from late position will work like a charm if you are holding a middle pair. Some of the time, you will win the pot outright, while other times, you will often be flipping with a slight equity advantage against a hand like AK or AQ.
The danger of running into a bigger pocket pair is significantly mitigated in tournaments as the stacks are smaller, diminishing your risk in contrast to the chips you stand to gain when the original raiser folds.
Small pocket pairs are among the most overplayed hands in poker, as their value is not as high as it seems.
While any pair is still a pair, small pocket pairs are problematic because any board that rolls off is usually made up of three overcards.
As such, you should play your small pocket pairs more cautiously than the higher ones and with more interest in improving to a set than playing the pair for its own value.
At deeper stack depths, small pocket pairs like 22, 33, 44, and 55 can be folded in early positions and opened in middle and late positions to a standard raise size.
If you get 3-bet before the flop, you should mainly be folding your small pocket pairs, as there are plenty of other hands you can continue with that have better equity against the 3-bettor’s range.
If you get one or multiple calls, you will be looking to improve to a set or win the pot with a continuation bet, which will often be possible thanks to your aggressive action before the flop.
In either case, small pocket pairs are not ideal hands to turn into multi-street bluffs or make hero calls with on the river. Instead, they are solid stealing hands with some potential to improve to sets and full houses on later streets.
In shallow stack situations, such as those that arise in tournaments, small pocket pairs are often great candidates to go all-in with before the flop and pick up the blinds and antes without any confrontation.
When called, your pocket pair will often be in a 50/50 race against two overcards, which is a situation you should not really mind too much.
A very important piece of advice in regards to playing pocket pairs has to do with adjusting your play to your table.
While trying to mimic solvers and play a GTO poker strategy may work well, playing exploitatively and making the most of your opponents’ mistakes should make you a lot more money over the long run.
The value of pocket pairs depends heavily on the opposition you are up against. For example, premium pocket pairs make a lot more money in splashy games where you can often get hundreds of big blinds into the pot preflop than in strong tight games where players are less willing to stack off.
Similarly, small pocket pairs don’t perform as well in games where preflop raises are big, and 3-bets are common, as they don’t get to see the flop nearly often or cheap enough to make set mining a profitable option.
The next time you play poker and are dealt a pocket pair, make sure you take a step back, assess your table, and make your decision based on your opponents and their general tendencies.
What is a pocket pair?
A pocket pair is a pair made up of both your hole cards. For example, if you are dealt two Aces before the flop, you are holding a pocket pair of Aces. Pocket pairs are powerful because they are completely concealed from your opponents, and they can make sets with just one card on the board.
What are the best pocket pairs in poker?
The best pocket pairs in poker are Aces, Kings, and Queens. These pocket pairs fall into the category of premium pocket pairs and are almost always good enough to bet all your chips with.
What are the odds of getting a pocket pair?
The odds of getting dealt any pocket pair are 17 to 1 or 5.9%. This means only one of 17 hands you are dealt will be a pocket pair, and there is no guarantee you will get a premium pocket pair even in hundreds of hands dealt.
What are the odds of getting dealt AA in poker?
The odds of getting dealt AA, or any other particular pair, are 220/1 or 0.45%. Only one of 220 starting hands will be a pair of Aces, so you better make the most of it when you get it.
How often will I flop a set with a pocket pair?
Flopping a set with a pocket pair is harder than it seems. You will only make a set on the flop 10.7% of the time, and those odds will improve to 18.4% if you include the turn and river card as well.
What is an overpair in poker?
An overpair is a pocket pair bigger than all the community cards. For example, if you are holding a pair of Queens on a board of Js8c4d, you are holding an overpair to the board.
What is set mining in Texas Hold’em?
Set mining is the action of calling a raise before the flop with a pocket pair with the sole intention of hitting the card you need to make a set on the flop. Playing pocket pairs with just this intention is usually inadvisable but can be a reasonable strategy in deep-stacked games against splashy opponents.
### TOPIC: poker combinations
Poker is a game with a lot of complexity and many strategies that can be used to come out on top, but they all start with some basic math.
Above all things, understanding how poker combinations work is essential, as this part of poker math, pot odds, and expected value are the underlying principles behind any play you should make at the table.
Whether we are talking about preflop raising ranges or river bluffs, all these things are based on a fundamental understanding of poker combinations.
For that reason, this article is aimed at teaching you how to count combinations in poker and how to use it to increase your EV in the long run.
Before we can use poker combinatorics, we must first learn how to count poker combos and what a combo is in poker.
In Texas Hold’em, there are 1,326 possible two-card starting hand combinations from a standard 52-card deck.These combinations are categorized into:* Pocket Pairs: 13 ranks × 6 combinations each = 78 combinations.* Suited Hands: (13 ranks × 12 lower ranks) / 2 × 4 suits = 312 combinations.* Offsuit Hands: (13 ranks × 12 lower ranks) / 2 × 12 suit combinations = 936 combinations.Applying Combinatorics to Hand Ranges:* By calculating the number of combinations for specific hands, players can better estimate opponents’ ranges.* For example, if an opponent’s range includes all suited connectors from 6♠5♠ to Q♠J♠, you can determine the exact number of combinations they might have.Strategic Implications:* Understanding combinations aids in making informed decisions regarding betting, calling, or folding.* It allows players to assess the likelihood of opponents holding certain hands, thereby refining bluffing and value-betting strategies.Practice and Application:* Regularly practicing combo counting enhances intuition and decision-making speed during live play.* Incorporating combinatorics into study routines can lead to a deeper understanding of game dynamics and improved performance.By mastering the concept of poker combinations, players can elevate their analytical skills, leading to more precise reads and strategic plays at the table.
Let’s start with some poker basics. First, poker is played with a standardized deck of playing cards, which is made up of 52 cards in total. There are four suits and 13 card ranks in each deck, making up the 52 cards.
In Texas Hold’em Poker, a total of 1,326 poker combinations can be made up of these 52 cards by combining each of them with all the other ones in the deck.
This includes pocket pairs, suited, and off-suit combinations of all the possible hands.
For a visual representation of poker combinations, you can take a look at the poker hand grid, which includes every possible hand combination.
You will notice that the hand grid is not split up into 1,326 fields, and this is for a good reason. Each field on the hand grid contains multiple hand combos!
In particular, hand combinations are counted as follows:
Off-suit hands have the most poker combinations because every card can be combined with three cards of suits that don’t match to create an off-suit combo. So, for instance, you can combine four Aces with three Kings each to create the 12 off-suit combinations of AK.
Similarly, each Ace can only be combined with one King to create a suited AK combination, leading to the four total combos of a suited hand.
Finally, there are six combos of every pocket pair. For example, AsAh, AsAd, AsAc, AhAd, AhAc, AdAc, and that’s the maximum number of pair combos you can have in any given spot.
This information may seem somewhat random, but it becomes essential when you start thinking about your opponent’s ranges and determining how likely they are to have different starting hands in the hole.
Now that you know what poker combinations are and how to count them, the real question is how you can use those to your advantage in-game.
To answer that question, we must first talk about how you should think about your opponent’s hands and your perceived hand in every situation.
Long gone are the days when we would try to guess our opponent’s hand and our opponent would try to guess ours, only to both end up being wrong at the showdown.
Instead, the game is now played on the level of poker ranges, where all skilled players are attempting to pinpoint a range of hands their opponents could possibly have in a given situation.
For example, a player raising from UTG can easily have AA, KK, QQ, AK, and a number of other hands, and there is really no way to tell one hand from another by that raise alone.
Yet, we can most definitely say (assuming he is a reasonably skilled player) that he does not have a hand like T2, 73, or K5, as he would definitely fold this hand from his position.
With each new action that is made at the table, we can narrow down the hand range of each active player in the hand until we are left with only a few possible hand combinations by the river.
As we enter the later streets, the importance of poker combinations becomes significant, as we can now start counting particular poker hand combinations a player might have.
For instance, we know that there is a total of six combinations of AA, twelve combinations of AK, and four combinations of AKs.
However, on a board of As9d7s, that number changes. There are now only three remaining combos of AA, nine combos of AK, and three combos of AKs, as the As on the board blocks out the other combos.
This, of course, is a very basic example of how counting hand combinations can help you throughout a poker hand as you reach the later streets and are able to discount more and more of the hand combos your opponent might have.
By the river, you will often be able to determine which specific card combinations your opponent may be betting for value and which could serve as reasonable bluff candidates to fire with, which can be the great deciding factor between bluff catching a big river bet or throwing your cards in the muck correctly.
We have briefly discussed how counting poker combinations can help you make the right decision, but let us put this skill to use in an example and demonstrate exactly how it works in real-game scenarios.
In a $1/3 live game in Las Vegas, you are seated in the big blind, and a player in the Cutoff opens to $10, to which you respond with a call.
The dealer puts out a flop of Ad5s6s, you check your entire range, and your opponent puts out a bet of $8 into the $21 pot.
At this point, our opponent’s range is still very wide and can include all sorts of hands, as it would make sense for them to continue betting with a big chunk of their opening range, if not the entire opening range.
This includes all pocket pairs, all suited Aces, all suited Broadways, plenty of off-suit Broadways, suited connectors, suited Kings, Queens, and more.
In fact, the opponent should be opening with about 30% of all starting hands, which would amount to over 400 poker combinations, too many to pinpoint at this time.
However, let us imagine you have a hand that’s worth raising on this flop, and you bump it up to $35, to which your opponent responds with a call.
Things have now changed dramatically!
Your opponent can no longer have random suited hands in clubs or hearts and will even give up some suited combos in diamonds, while some players will fold all diamond combos except the ones that also have a straight draw.
You can now start counting actual hand combinations that our opponent can have. Let’s start by counting the hands that have at least top pair or better in this spot:
This is a total of 115 poker combinations of top pair or better that our opponent would probably call the flop raise with, considering we can have a number of drawing hands to be raising with.
In addition, our opponent can have a number of flush draws and straight draws himself, with hands like 43s, 87s, and 97s all coming to mind, along with all suited hands in spades like KsQs, KsJs, KsTs, QsJs, QsTs, JsTs, Ts9s, Ts8s, 9s8s, and numerous straight draws in other suits.
As the hand progresses and you get more information on your opponent’s hand, it is possible to decrease the number of poker hand combos in their range, often to just a few dozen total combos.
Thinking about poker hands in terms of hand combinations every time you play will help you get a better understanding of poker and determine what playing style you’re up against and how likely they are to be bluffing in certain spots.
For example, if you notice a player continuing to barrel turns with hands like weak draws or even no-draw type hands, you can use that information to your advantage later and assume they have a lot more combos of bluffs in their range when betting than an average player.
Now that you understand what poker combinations are and how to count them, you can do some practice away from the table and prepare for your next game.
Once you learn how to count poker combinations quickly while playing, you will be able to construct your opponents’ ranges faster and reach better conclusions on what they are likely to have.
Doing these types of exercises at home can help you improve your poker strategy, become a much better poker player over time, and think about poker on a whole other level than most other players in your games.
Poker combinations, also known as combos, are combinations of cards that make up a particular starting hand. For example, there are exactly six combinations of Pocket Aces (AA). These are AsAh, AsAd, AsAc, AhAd, AhAc, AdAc. Counting poker combos helps when trying to determine the value and bluffing hands your opponents can have in certain situations.
In total, there are 1,326 poker combinations, including all pocket pairs, suited, and offsuit hands. These combinations are built from the 52 cards in a standard playing card deck, which is made up of 13 card ranks and four suits.
There are exactly six combinations of each pocket pair in Texas Hold’em Poker. Whether you are talking about AA or 22, the number of combos that make up these hands is the same, as are the odds of being dealt each particular pocket pair.
There are exactly four combinations of suited poker hands in Texas Hold’em Poker. For example, if you think your opponent might have AKs, the combos they can possibly have are AsKs, AhKh, AdKd, and AcKc. If any one of these cards is in your hand or on the board, you can discount that poker combo from the equation.
There are exactly 12 combinations of each offsuit poker hand out there. For example, if you think your opponent might have AQo, the combos they can possibly have include AsQh, AsQd, AsQc, etc. Each Ace can be paired with three Queens to create an offsuit combo, while the fourth Queen would create a suited combo and is not counted.
Blockers are cards that deny your opponent from having certain poker combinations. For example, if you hold AsAd, it is not possible for your opponent to have poker combos that contain these cards. If the board comes up with three Spades or three Diamonds, it will not be possible for your opponent to have the Ace-high flush since you hold the relevant cards.
### TOPIC: poker hand rankings
The first thing you must understand when learning how to play poker is the different poker hands you can make and how to rank them.
In Texas Hold’em, the best hands in order are royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pair, one pair, and high card.
The poker hand chart below will help you understand official poker hand rankings and start playing the game with the knowledge of all the possible combinations you can make.

Ties and Kickers in Poker
The above table shows you all the possible Texas Hold’em hands, but there is more to be told, as there are situations in Texas Hold’em where looking at this chart alone is not enough.
A good example of this is when two players have the exact same hand. For instance, at showdown, two players could have the same straight with two of their hole cards and three community cards.
In a case like this, the hand is tied, and the dealer will split the pot between the two players equally. If more players are involved in the hand, they will all receive an equal portion of the pot.
In other cases, two players may have the same hand, but the kicker will decide the winner. The kicker is the highest card the player has, along with his made hand.
For example, if two players have three of a kind on a board of 8c8d5c3d2h, the player with the highest kicker will win. A player holding Ad8s would beat the player holding 9s8h because the Ace kicker beats the Nine kicker.
Kickers can come into play with a variety of hands, such as one pair, two pairs, and three of a kind. In situations where multiple players have straight or flushes, the player with the higher straight or flush wins.
Do Poker Suits Matter?
Another good question about poker hand rankings in Texas Hold’em is whether poker suits come into play.
The answer, quite simply, is that poker suits don’t matter in Texas Hold’em games. Suits will not be the deciding factor in who wins the pot in any scenario.
Since it is not possible for two flushes in different suits to be present in one Texas Hold’em hand, this scenario is not even in question. In all other situations, the suits of your cards will not help or hurt your chances of winning the pot, so pay them all equally.
Poker Hands in Order
Download Poker Hands List
We have listed all the possible poker hands, but let’s take a deeper dive and find out exactly how they rank up and how to make them in Texas Hold’em Poker.
#1. Royal Flush
A royal flush is the best possible combination of cards in Texas Hold’em. If you have this hand, you will win the pot, and there is no way for anyone to beat you.
A royal flush is made up of five consecutive cards of the highest ranking in the same suit. For example, AhKhQhJhTh is a royal flush.
You can make a royal flush with any combination of hole cards and community cards, but using both your hole cards to make it is the least probably and most advantageous situation.
You will probably only make a royal flush a few times in hundreds of hours of playing poker, so make sure it counts.
#2. Straight Flush
Ranking just below a royal flush is a straight flush, a hand made up of five consecutive cards of any suits that don’t go up to the Ace.
For example, if you are holding 9s8s7s6s5s, you have a straight flush. This hand is nearly unbeatable and can only lose to a higher straight flush or a royal flush.
Straight flushes are also very rare, and making one in Texas Hold’em usually means you are about to win a big pot if your opponents give you action.
#3. Four of a Kind
Also known as quads, four of a kind is an extremely powerful poker hand and the best possible hand on many boards in Texas Hold’em.
An example of four of a kind would be KdKsKhKc9s, a hand containing four cards of the same rank along with another card on the side.
Four of a kind is akin to a straight flush in that it almost always wins the pot and is extremely hard to make in the game.
#4. Full House
A slightly more common hand than the above, a full house is made up of three cards of one rank and a pair of cards of another.
For example, QdQsQhJdJc makes for a powerful full house. Depending on the board texture, a full house can be the best possible poker hand in a given situation.
When you have a full house in Texas Hold’em, you will want to make bets and get some value, but be careful of higher full houses that might be lurking in the dark.
#5. Flush
A flush is a hand made up of five cards of the same suit that are not ranked in any particular order. For example, KdJd7d4d2d makes a flush.
If you make a flush in Texas Hold’em, you will want to be aware of any higher flushes that are possible, as well as the board pairing, as this opens opportunities for full houses and quads in other players’ hands.
#6. Straight
The next best hand in poker is straight, which is made up of five consecutive cards that are not suited, such as 7d6s5c4d3d for a 7-high straight.
Straights can be strong poker hands and even “the nuts” on some boards, but they can also be troublesome on certain community cards.
Calling bets to try and make a straight can be a good idea, but beware of cards of the same suit and board pairing when you have one.
#7. Three of a Kind
In Texas Hold’em Poker, there are two ways to make this particular poker hand. In either case, it is made up of three cards of the same rank, such as 6d6c6hAd3c.
When three of a kind is made with one hole card and two community cards, the hand is called “trips,” and your kicker will often play a big part in its strength.
On the other hand, when three of a kind are made with two hole cards and one community card, this is called a “set” and is a much more powerful and concealed hand.
#8. Two Pairs
A poker hand made of two pairs of cards of different rankings is called two pairs. For example, KdKc7d7c4s makes two pairs.
Two pairs is a hand with plenty of value in Texas Hold’em, but also one that you will want to be careful with when a lot of action goes down.
#9. One Pair
If you hold just one pair of cards of the same rank, along with three other cards, you have one pair, the weakest “made hand” in poker.
One pair hands is often a winner in poker but can be in trouble when the pot gets big and there is nothing else to fall back on.
#10. High Card
If you have no pair or any of the higher-ranked poker combinations, your high card will come into play and decide the winner.
For example, if a hand goes all the way to showdown, and neither player has a pair, the highest cards in the players’ hands will decide who wins.
If the highest card is the same, the next highest card will play, regardless of suits and any other details of the hand.
Poker Hand Probabilities
Poker is a game of odds and probabilities, and knowing what the probability is of different outcomes is an essential part of the game.
In total, there are 169 different starting hands and 1,326 starting card combinations in poker, with as many as 2,598,960 possible five-card combinations out there.
Of your starting hands, 5.8% will be pocket pairs, about 23.5% will be suited, and all the others will be neither paired nor suited.
But what are the odds of making specific poker hands by the river, and how likely are you to make a royal flush, quads, or a full house? Let’s find out!
Poker Hand Odds to Make Probability Royal Flush 1 in 649,740 0.00015% Straight Flush 1 in 72,193 0.0014% Four of a Kind 1 in 4,166 0.024% Full House 1 in 695 0.144% Flush 1 in 510 0.1965% Straight 1 in 256 0.39% Three of a Kind 1 in 47 2.11% Two Pair 1 in 21 4.75% One Pair 1 in 2.37 42.2% No Pair 1 in 2 50.1%
What are the Odds of Getting a Royal Flush?
A royal flush is the best possible hand in poker, but if you have ever played the game, you probably know just how unlikely you are to make one.
The probability of making a royal flush is incredibly low, as only one in 649,740 poker card combinations is a royal flush.
This means you will have to play poker for quite a while before you finally make a royal flush, and you may not even get to see it if you end up folding the cards preflop, on the flop, or the turn.
If you have never had a royal flush in Texas Hold’em, you are not the only one, as the odds of making a royal flush are only 0.000154% with just five cards, but the two extra cards in Texas Hold’em do make it somewhat more likely to come in.
What are the Odds of Getting a Straight Flush?
A straight flush is a lot more common than a royal flush, as it can be made up of any five consecutive cards of the same suit.
Yet, even a straight flush appears only 1 in 72,193 hands in Five Card Draw poker, which still makes it one of the least likely things to see at a poker table.
The odds are significantly improved compared to a royal flush, as 0.00139% of all five card hands are straight flushes, which means this is the number of times you will have a straight flush by flop in Texas Hold’em.
What are the Odds of Getting Four of a Kind?
Four of a kind is the next best hand in poker and one that almost always takes the pot down both in five card games and in Texas Hold’em.
The odds of making quads are significantly higher than those of making a straight flush, as 1 in 4,166 poker combos make four of a kind.
Still, you may go a long time without making this hand, as only 0.024% of all five card combinations include four cards of the same rank.
What are the Odds of Getting a Full House?
A full house is an even more likely hand to have in poker, and you will see this one take down pots time and time again in Texas Hold’em.
The odds of making a full house are 0.144%, but with many players to a table and multiple streets played, a full house will be dealt at a Texas Hold’em table significantly more often than the stronger hands.
One in 695 five card combos make a full house, and there are quite a few opportunities to make this hand in Texas Hold’em.
What are the Odds of Getting a Flush?
When it comes to flushes, 0.196% of all hands, or 1 in 510, are flushes, which means there will be flushes circulating through the table over a game of Texas Hold’em, with seven cards making a significant number of combos.
A flush is not as strong as full houses and stronger hands, but making a flush with a strong kicker in Texas Hold’em will make you a favorite to have the best hand quite often.
What are the Odds of Getting a Straight?
A straight is another hand that requires five specific card ranks, but without the need to be suited, their numbers go up.
The odds against a hand being a straight are 255:1 in a vacuum, as 0.39% of all five card combinations make up a straight.
What are the Odds of Getting Three of a Kind?
Three of a kind is the next best hand, and there are multiple ways to make three of a kind in Texas Hold’em Poker, which significantly boosts your odds.
In general, the odds of a poker hand being three of a kind are 46:1, as 2.11% of all five card hands include three cards of the same rank.
What are the Odds of Getting Two Pair?
The odds of making two pairs are even higher than any of the other hands we talked about thus far, as 4.75% of all hands in poker include two pairs.
If you were to take five random cards, you would have two pairs about 1 in 21 times, which makes this a reasonable hand to make, but one that will still be the winner in many hands in Texas Hold’em Poker.
What are the Odds of Getting One Pair?
One pair may not be a huge hand in poker, but it is also not that hard to make, as over 42% of all five card combos include a pair.
You will make a pair 1 in 2.37 times with just five cards, which means you are reasonably likely to have one pair by the flop.
Keep in mind that in Texas Hold’em, having just one pair on the board is not going to be enough to win too many pots, with the top pair being the one exception to this rule.
What are the Odds of Getting a High Card?
Just over 50% of all five card combos end up being nothing but high cards, which means you should not be surprised when the flop does not improve your poker hand in any significant way.
Fortunately for us, Texas Hold’em is played with seven cards in total, and there are some chances to improve our hand further if the flop brings just a draw.
What Beats What in Poker?
If you are new to poker, you may not be sure what hand beats what in the game and when you have the best of it.
Now that you know the probability of making different Texas Hold’em hands, it’s time to consider what beats what in poker and which hands are better than others.
Does a Royal Flush Beat a Straight Flush?
A royal flush is the best possible hand in Texas Hold’em and most other poker variants, and there is no hand that beats it.
If you happen to have a royal flush against a weaker straight flush of your opponent, you will win the pot, and it will probably be a big one as well.
Learn why a royal flush beats a straight flush in poker.
Does a Straight Flush Beat Four of a Kind?
Four of a kind is a powerhouse in poker, but when faced with a straight flush, it will lose the pot regardless of how high the straight flush is.
In fact, straight flush and royal flush are the only two hands that can beat quads in poker, making it an unlikely but not an impossible scenario.
Learn why a straight flush beats four of a kind in poker.
Does a Straight Flush Beat a Full House?
A straight flush beats all poker hands except a royal flush or a higher straight flush, and it always beats a full house as well. Full houses are powerful hands but cannot beat a straight flush or a royal flush.
Learn why a straight flush beats a full house in poker.
Does Four of a Kind Beat a Full House?
A full house against quads is an encounter that happens more commonly than others listed thus far, as similar paired boards are needed for both hands to be possible.
If you happen to have quads against a full house on a paired board, you will win the pot, as four of a kind ranks higher in poker than a full house.
Learn why four of a kind beats a full house in poker.
Does a Full House Beat a Flush?
Full houses beat all hands other than quads and straight flushes in poker, and flushes are no different, regardless of their suit or rank.
This is why you must be careful when playing flushes on paired boards where full houses are a possibility in Texas Hold’em Poker.
Learn why a full house beats a flush in poker.
Does a Full House Beat a Straight?
A full house is a poker powerhouse and will beat a straight with ease. Being one of the best ranked poker hands, a full house always beats any straight other than a straight flush.
Learn why a full house beats a straight in poker.
Does a Flush Beat a Straight?
A flush outranks a straight by one rank on the poker hands chart and always beats a straight regardless of the ranks of cards used to make it.
Learn why a flush beats a straight in poker.
Does a Flush Beat Three of a Kind?
Flushes are much more powerful than three of a kind in poker, with every flush beating every three of a kind hand.
Regardless of whether your three-of-a-kind comes with one or two hole cards, any flush in your opponent’s hand will be good for the entire pot.
Learn why a flush beats three-of-a-kind in poker.
Does a Straight Beat Three of a Kind?
Similar to a flush, a straight beats three of a kind in Texas Hold’em, as the hand stands higher on the poker hands chart and is an undisputed winner of this showdown.
Learn why a straight beats three of a kind in poker.
Does a Straight Beat Two Pair?
Two pairs is a hand even weaker than three of a kind, and a straight will beat it just as easily, as two pairs do not have the kind of power to stand up to straights.
Learn why a straigh beats two pairs in poker.
Does Three of a Kind Beat Two Pairs?
Similar to a straight, three of a kind beats two pairs in all poker games because it is a much harder hand to make. Weather you have a set or trips to make your three-of-a-kind hand, you will win against any two pairs.
Learn why three of a kind beats two pairs in poker.
Does Two Pair Beat One Pair?
You might have guessed this one without even knowing the basic rules of poker, as two is usually better than one.
Two pairs is always better than one pair regardless of the card ranks, so even if you have two pair of deuces and three, it will be good enough to beat a single pair of kings or aces.
Learn why two pairs beat one pair in poker.
Does One Pair Beat a High Card Hand?
One pair is the weakest “made hand” in poker, and it will beat any lower pair and any non-pair hand, also known as a high card hand.
A high-card hand is a hand that does not have any standing on the hand chart and can only win against other weaker high-card hands.
Learn why one pair beats a high card in poker.
Best Texas Hold’em Hands
If you are new to the game of Texas Hold’em or are just starting with poker in general, you will need to know which hands to start with.
We have listed the best starting hands here, with the ten hands mentioned being the absolute best hole cards you can get and the best opportunities to get involved in the game of Texas Hold’em.
Pocket Aces
Also known as Pocket Rockets or American Airlines, Pocket Aces is the best starting hand in the game and one you will never want to fold before the flop.
Pocket Aces are good enough to play from any position and at any stack depth and should always be played as a raise unless you have a specific reason to set a trap.
Regardless of your skill level, Pocket Aces should be the most profitable hand you play. You will only get dealt Pocket Aces once in 221 hands, so make sure to make the best of them when you do.
Pocket Kings
Ranked just below Pocket Aces, Pocket Kings is another hand that players get super excited to see, as it beats nearly all other cards in the game.
Like Aces, Pocket Kings are dealt once in 221 hands, making it a rare but welcome sight in any game, tournament, or cash.
As long as you are not playing an extremely deep stack, you should always be happy to commit your chips with KK, as you will usually be up against a weaker pair or worse.
Pocket Queens
A pair of Ladies is almost as good as a pair of Kings, but Pocket Queens fade a bit in strength as they only have slightly above 50% chance of winning against Ace King specifically.
That said, a pair of Queens is still always a great starting hand that you should open with a raise and usually put in multiple raises when the opportunity arises.
Like other pairs, Pocket Queens come once in 221 hands, and as long as you are not super unlucky, they will be the best hand before the flop.
Ace King Suited
Next on the poker hand rankings is Ace King Suited, another powerhouse of the game and a hand many players prefer to see to Pocket Queens and is dealt once in 111 times.
Ace King Suited is a hand that plays extremely well in deep stacked games, but performs just as well in tournaments as well, as it is almost never a huge underdog.
Ace King Suited plays great against all hands, but AA and KK. It will even do OK against KK, which is why it’s ranked as number four of all the Texas Hold’em Poker hands.
Pocket Jacks
The next pocket pair in order is Pocket Jacks, a hand that some players have a lot of trouble playing, but that’s generally still an extremely profitable one.
Pocket Jacks can be a bit tricky to play, especially as stacks get deeper, and you want to make sure not to overplay this particular pocket pair.
All that said, JJ will make you a lot of money over a lifetime of playing poker, and even more if you don’t get married to them and are willing to fold when the going gets rough.
Ace King Offsuit
The offsuit version of the game’s fourth-best hand comes in place number six, as Pocket Jacks simply has a bit more playability and value.
Nevertheless, Ace King Off has almost as much equity in all situations as its suited version and is a hand you will usually want to play for a lot of chips.
Ace Queen Suited
Next on our list of the best poker hands is Ace Queen Suited, an unpaired hand that has a lot of similarities with Ace King Suited.
Ace Queen Suited is nearly the same hand, but you will run it into AK specifically from time to time, which makes it slightly worse to play.
Yet, AQs is a hand you should rarely miss playing and one that will win you many big pots once you learn how to play it right.
Pocket Tens
Another good pocket pair, Pocket Tens is one that some don’t consider a premium, while others do, which makes it a bit of a fringe hands.
That said, TT is a very powerful pocket pair, but one that will face overcards on the board more often than not, which can make it slightly tricky to play after the flop.
Pocket Nines
A pair of Nines is not much different in value than a pair of Tens, and the value of the two hands is quite similar in every poker format.
Pocket Nines are always a good raising hand and one that you will be happy to commit many tournament stacks with, but one that you must be more cautious with in deep-stacked games.
Ace Jack Suited
Completing our list of the top ten hands in poker is Ace Jack Suited, another version of suited Ace that does not quite compare to its stronger versions.
Ace Jack Suited is a pretty good hand, but certainly no longer falls into the line of premiums and is one that can be folded before the flop quite often under the right circumstances.

Preflop Poker Charts for Cash Games
Cash games can be more complex than tournaments, mostly because the stacks in cash games tend to stay deep throughout the duration of a session
On the other hand, cash game players don’t have to spend too much time learning how to play poker with a short stack, as such scenarios rarely occur at cash game tables.
Our preflop poker charts for cash games offer optimal solutions for preflop play in 6-Max and Full Ring cash games and simplify the strategy to one that is relatively easy to memorize and implement in actual games.
Poker Preflop Charts for 6-Max
6-Max cash games are extremely popular these days, and our 6-max preflop charts for 6-Max offer a complete game plan for all preflop play in them. Here are the hands you should be opening in a standard 100bb situation:
LJ: 17.6% - 66+,A3s+,K8s+,Q9s+,J9s+,T9s,ATo+,KJo+,QJo
HJ: 21.4% - 55+,A2s+,K6s+,Q9s+,J9s+,T9s,98s,87s,76s,ATo+,KTo+,QTo+
CO: 27.8% - 33+,A2s+,K3s+,Q6s+,J8s+,T7s+,97s+,87s,76s,A8o+,KTo+,QTo+,JTo
BTN: 43.5% - 33+,A2s+,K2s+,Q3s+,J4s+,T6s+,96s+,85s+,75s+,64s+,53s+,A4o+,K8o+,Q9o+,J9o+,T8o+,98o
SB: Raise or Call 62.3% - 22+,A2s+,K2s+,Q2s+,J2s+,T3s+,94s+,84s+,74s+,63s+,53s+,43s,A2o+,K4o+,Q5o+,J7o+,T7o+,96o+,86o+,76o
Our charts for 6-Max cash games are dubbed as “implementable” because they do not represent the exact replication of optimal preflop gameplay.
Instead, they give you access to a more simplified strategy that comes as close as possible to actual GTO preflop solutions.
Since solvers often recommend playing the same hand in different ways at certain frequencies, it is nearly impossible to memorize what frequency each hand should be played as a fold, call, or raise.
Our implementable 6-Max charts simplify this strategy to give you one solution for every hand you can get, assuming 100 big blind stacks.
The charts are split into RFI and Facing RFI in position and out of position, as well as Blind vs Blind, offering solutions for all the most frequent situations in 6-Max cash games.
When using the 6-Max preflop charts, remember you should use the following raise sizes:
Raise to 2.5bb first in
Raise to 3bb first in from SB
3-Bet to 3.5x the raise IP
3-Bet to 4x the raise OOP
Raise to 3.5bb in BB facing SB limp
4-bet to 2.5x the 3-bet OOP
4-bet to 2.3x the 3-bet IP
Starting Hands for Full-Ring Poker Games (8-max)
Unlike 6-Max cash games, full-ring cash games are usually played with eight players at a table, which means more hands per orbit and more positions at the table.
Preflop hand ranges for full-ring cash games are similar to those for 6-Max games, except for the two earliest positions, who should play an even tighter range than UTG in 6-Max cash games. Here are the hands:
UTG: 11.4% - 77+,A3s+,K9s+,QTs+,JTs,T9s,AQo+,KQo
UTG+1: 13.2% - 77+,A3s+,K8s+,QTs+,JTs,T9s,AJo+,KQo
LJ: 15.7% - 66+,A2s+,K7s+,QTs+,JTs,T9s,ATo+,KJo+
HJ: 19.6% - 55+,A2s+,K5s+,Q9s+,J9s+,T9s,ATo+,KTo+,QJo
CO: 26.1% - 44+,A2s+,K5s+,Q8s+,J8s+,T8s+,97s+,87s,76s,65s,54s,A8o+,KTo+,QTo+,JTo
BTN: 40.3% - 22+,A2s+,K2s+,Q3s+,J5s+,T6s+,96s+,86s+,76s,65s,54s,A3o+,K8o+,Q9o+,J9o+,T9o
SB: Call or Raise 73.9% - 22+,A2s+,K2s+,Q2s+,J2s+,T2s+,92s+,84s+,73s+,63s+,52s+,42s+,A2o+,K2o+,Q3o+,J5o+,T6o+,96o+,86o+,75o+,65o,54o
Additionally, if you want to play full-ring cash games, you have to learn how to handle opens from early positions in a full-ring cash game.
You can find all the necessary ranges once you gain access to our full GTO poker ranges calculator, which allows you to generate any range for any position and any stack size you want.

### TOPIC: ranges explained
The biggest challenge players face when learning how to play poker is figuring out what hand their opponent is holding. While many players focus on guessing the exact two cards their opponent has, poker pros use the concept of poker ranges to play the game more effectively.
Simply put, a poker range is a group of hands a player can have in a given situation, considering the action that led to that spot and all the other factors at play.
Instead of putting your opponent on AK and making that hero call with the bottom pair over and over again, you will need to learn how to think about ranges in poker and determine them more precisely.
If you are just getting started, you have come to the right place, as we will teach you how to approach this area, how to balance your own range, and much more.
* Think in Ranges, Not Specific Hands: Instead of guessing exact hands, consider the full spectrum of hands an opponent might hold based on their actions and position.* Preflop Ranges Depend on Position and Player Type: Early position players typically have tighter ranges, while late position players might play a wider range of hands.Narrow Opponent’s Range Through Actions: Each betting action provides information. For example, a large preflop raise from early position suggests a strong range.* Understand Range Advantage: On certain board textures, one player’s range may have a significant advantage. Recognizing this can inform betting strategies.* Differentiate Between Linear and Polarized Ranges: A linear range includes a sequence of strong hands, while a polarized range consists of very strong hands and bluffs, excluding medium-strength hands.
Very simply put, a poker range is a collection of all poker hands a player can have in a given situation, considering all the factors that could impact the range.
You will be able to determine players’ poker ranges based on their position, preflop play, flop, turn, and river actions, bet sizes, and sometimes even particular tells.
It is important to realize that each action a player takes helps narrow their range down and tells us a story about the possible hands they can have.
Did your opponent call a huge isolation raise before the flop? Chances are 93 offsuit is not in their range unless they are a complete calling station, which would be another element helping you determine a range.
As the hand goes on and players take more action, you should be able to continue narrowing their possible holdings down until you are left with only a handful of potential hands by the river.
Preflop charts like the ones found on PokerCoaching.com can help you know the proper ranges to use when playing in poker tournaments and cash games.
The hand grid is one of the most popular tools for analyzing poker hands. It is made up of all the possible card combinations, with the upper part representing suited hands and the lower part representing offsuit hands and pocket pairs shown on the diagonal line across the grid.
When looking at poker ranges, the hand grid is the easiest way to visualize a player’s range, remove hands according to the ongoing action, and figure out which hands you could actually be up against.
You will not have a hand grid open when you play poker, but using various strategies while studying GTO poker will help you visualize the game in your head, even while actually playing it.
Another way to display a player’s range is as a percentage of all possible hands. For instance, a 15% range will consist of the top 15% of all starting hands in poker, although this number can be misleading.
If properly constructed, a poker range will consist of strong hands and bluffs, which means it could contain hands that don’t belong to the top x% of all hands on the grid.
That said, depending on the player and the position they are playing for, you should be able to determine the % of hands they are playing in a given hand with a reasonable success rate.
The process of putting a player on a particular range starts before the flop, the moment they put their first chip into the pot.
When the cards are dealt, everyone works within a 100% range, but in most cases, players who enter a pot without being forced to will not have 100% of all hands.
A number of factors can help you put a player on a particular group of hands before the flop. Just a few things to consider:
The above diagram displays the names of each position in a 9-handed poker game.
A player opening to 3x from an early position will certainly tell us something about their range, although it can differ quite a bit from one player to the next.
For the most part, serious poker players play similar starting hands, as game theory optimal opening ranges have been calculated, and steering too far away from them is generally not a good idea.
However, it is important to keep in mind that many players don’t actually know what hand ranges they should be opening or calling with from various positions, which will force us to make some guesses.
At the end of the preflop betting round, you should be in a position where you have an approximation of each remaining player’s range, which will still be fairly wide in most cases, especially in single raised pots. If you are not sure about what ranges players might be starting with, here is a quick table that demonstrates the most common opening % from each table position in a full-ring game from someone adopting a solid poker strategy:
Once the flop is dealt in Texas Hold’em, the real ranging process can begin, as you can start removing hands from players’ ranges and narrowing them down.
Narrowing down a player’s likely holdings is an art that requires you to pay close attention to what’s happening at the table.
Each action on each of the three postflop betting streets will give you new information about your opponent’s hand, which you can use to narrow down their range.
As you move into the later betting streets, you can ask yourself a variety of questions that will help you determine which hands they still can and can’t have in their range.
Some of these questions can be:
Each of these questions can help you make educated guesses about your opponent’s range and take certain hands out of it altogether. Keep practicing these skills, and make sure to always ask yourself as many questions about your opponent as you can before making any decisions.
Over time, you will become so good at putting players on ranges that you will make very few mistakes, and your decisions will become a lot easier and more profitable.
Tools like the FREE Range Analyzer on PokerCoaching.com can help you better study poker ranges.
While identifying the poker ranges of other players at the table is an essential part of any good poker strategy, the very best players are also aware of their range and build it in a balanced way that does not allow their opponents to exploit it.
Balancing it out is a difficult process that starts before the flop and continues through every betting round in the hand.
The first part includes enough bluffing hands in your pre-flop raising and 3-betting ranges, but it is also important to remain balanced throughout the hand.
Many players will bluff way too often or too rarely after the flop, making their strategy easily exploitable by opponents who are paying attention.
On the other hand, a well-balanced strategy will strive to always include just the right amount of bluffs for every bet size and always keep the opponents guessing.
Keep in mind that playing a perfectly balanced strategy is impossible for humans, but learning from poker solvers and trying to mimic their level of balance will make you a nearly unbeatable player at the poker table.
Thinking about poker in terms of ranges instead of particular hands is one of the hardest skills to master in poker, so don’t worry if you aren’t quite there just yet.
The most important thing is to always return to your sessions after you play them, analyze your hands, and try to consider your opponent’s and possible ranges in honest and realistic ways.
Fortunately, quite a few poker tools, including our poker cheat sheets, help you visualize and compare your opponents’ ranges. This is definitely the best way to practice ranging your opponents and calculating your equity against particular ranges.
If you start working with these tools today, we can promise you that in a few months, you will become a much better poker player and will learn to think about the game in a whole new way.
A range in poker is a spectrum of poker hands a player can have in a particular situation. The concept of ranges allows you to think about your hand and your opponent’s hands in terms of a collection of hands rather than one particular hand. When analyzing an opponent’s range, you will narrow it down with each new action that takes place, eventually pinpointing the player’s potential holdings.
In order to memorize a poker range, it is best to create a visual representation of the range using one of the many poker range tools. Then, try to remember the cutoff hands, which are the worst hands from each category you should play in a given situation. Remember that it is not critical to always play perfect ranges but rather to play ranges that are as close to optimal as possible.
An opening range in poker is a range of hands you should be raising if you are the first player into the pot. This is the percentage of hands you should raise when you are the first player to take aggressive action, which is also why these ranges are referred to as raise first in (RFI) ranges.
You can narrow down a player’s range by observing their actions and tendencies. With each new action that a player makes, you should be able to remove some hands from their range. Their preflop action will be the first step in determining a range, and each subsequent check, bet, raise, or call will give you a chance to narrow down their range even further.
Range advantage in poker refers to a situation in which one player’s range has a significant advantage over another player’s range on a given board. For example, a board of AKQ heavily favors the UTG raiser’s range over the BB caller’s range, as the raiser’s range has a lot more strong hands like AA, KK, QQ, AK, AQ, and JT on this board than the defender’s range.
A balanced range is a hand range that contains a balanced amount of value hands and bluffs. If you want to play good poker, you should always aim to balance your ranges, at least to some degree. You can play unbalanced ranges for the purpose of exploiting your opponents’ tendencies, but this will also make your own ranges open to exploitation.
A linear poker range is a range of hands that is typically very strong and does not include any gaps or big jumps in value. A linear range is made up of the strongest hands, and the best draws on a given board without any weak bluffs in the mix.
A polarized hand range is a range made up of the strongest possible hands and complete bluffs on a given board. A polarized range does not include any hands of middling value but rather only hands that are the virtual nuts and bluffs with very little equity.
### TOPIC: river value bet decision
I’ve got another hand that came from the PokerCoaching cash game Discord channel. But in this case, it was one of my hands. Here’s a link to the entire discussion if you want to dive down the rabbit hole. But I’ll warn you it’s 30-odd posts, some of them quite long. Here are the Cliff Notes…
I’m playing in the local $5/$10 Texas Hold’em game. Actually, it’s a $3/$5 game with a $10 “rock,” meaning that whoever wins the pot puts out a $10 straddle, and the action starts to their left. In this particular case, the rock was either UTG or UTG+1, so it looked like a fairly normal preflop configuration.
There are three limps to me on the button, and I find K♥10♦. I made it $60, but before we could go any further, some controversy erupted in the discussion. Among the comments:
As you can see, we have Team Fold, Team Limp, and Team Raise. Poker is hard.
I could easily be persuaded to join Team Fold, but there was no universe in which I was throwing in with Team Limp. I wrote:
“There’s no way on God’s green earth that I’m over-limping. I wouldn’t need more than a whisper of an excuse to fold – anything would do. But if I’m VPIPing, I’m raising. I have the button, they don’t. Somebody 3bets me, they win, fine. But they don’t 3bet me enough. They call and then play a pot out-of-position with a capped range. Poor them.”
Anyway, I’m driving the bus, so I raise, and only Don, a regular in the game who had limped from UTG+2 or so, calls. Don started with about $1200 and I cover by a little. Don and I have played a lot together – he’s one of the better regs in our pool, and I’m pretty sure he respects my game. Also, we had tangled in a big pot just two nights earlier, which plays into what happens later. Stand by.
With $160 in the pot, the flop is 10♥-4♥-4♣. He checks. Pretending this was me opening the button and Don defending in BB; poker solvers bet about 70% of the time, but I think there’s a 0.01 BB difference across all bet sizes and checking.
I bet $60, Don calls without much hesitation.
Fortunately, the assembled multitude in the Discord was comfortable with this choice.
There’s $280 in the pot, and the turn makes the board 10♥-4♥-4♣–8♠. Don checks.
Now, the Machine checks my hand 95% of the time. Wow, I certainly didn’t expect that. I suspect that’s because it fears the Evil Anti-Machine will check/raise it some amount and put it in a tough spot. But it thinks the EV of checking and B75 (betting 75% of the pot) are just 0.01 BB different, so it’s not like I’m losing EV by betting. If this opponent check/raises me, he just has it way more often than I can call, so in my world, it’s a classic bet/fold spot.
My targets are worse tens (I think he has JTs and T9s a lot) and heart draws. I B80 ($225), Don thinks briefly and calls.
Again, the Discord crew was on-board with this play. And I wasn’t the only one who was surprised by the frequent checking. Dilly wrote:“The solver checking turn very frequently is interesting. I don’t think Don is supposed to have too many turn check/raises because they should check/raise the small flop bet fairly aggressively. In any event, I expect you to get checked/raised less frequently than the solver, no matter which way you look at it.  Often when the solver is checking a lot with hands as strong as this, it really wants us to polarize and go for big overbet sizes, but I’m not sure that makes sense here given the paired flop. B75 seems fine, though.”
I need to do some study about why the Machine checks back so much.
With $730 in the middle, the river misses the flush draw, but does pair the turn eight: 10♥-4♥-4♣–8♠–8♣.
Don pauses briefly, and checks for the final time. There is about $850 behind in the stacks.
As is good etiquette in such discussions, I paused the narrative and asked what I should do. But before I did, I added the information that I had alluded to earlier:
Two nights prior, Don and I had played a big pot. It ended up with me shoving the turn with a flush draw. Don had a strong hand and called, so he got to see that I was willing to make such a play.
Now what do you think I should do in this spot? I’ve got top pair with a king kicker. The obvious draw has bricked. Here’s what the Discorders thought:
“The SPR is awkward, but I’m gonna go with shoving. I don’t actually like the sizing but because of [the big pot you played earlier] I think it’s more excusable.”
“It’s wild that I spent the time writing up all those combo possibilities and didn’t include ATo. I’m fairly confident ATs raises preflop, but ATo is definitely possible.”
Don doesn’t have JJ+ because he certainly would have raised those pre-flop. He folds his busted heart draws (unlike Dilly, I don’t think he’s going to hero-call with AhXh). I don’t know if he’ll find a hero call with 77 or 99.
I don’t think he has a four or an eight, and there are two reasons for that. First, I expect him to check/raise a four at some point in the proceedings because he fears the dreaded third heart coming out. By the time we reach the river, he just doesn’t have a four.
Could he have an eight, such as 9h8h or Ah8h? Absolutely. However, I expect that he will never check those on the river. Why? Because nobody in my position is foolish enough to bet the river in a spot like that with a hand like QQ when they’ve been checked to. Now, I think that QQ is actually a great value bet in my shoes, but very few people in my player pool believe that, and I’m pretty sure Don agrees with them.
So I have ruled out overpairs and monsters. What does that leave that’s worse than my hand that can call?
Tens. Lots and lots of tens.
One better ten (AT) and some worse tens. JTs, T9s. Now, all of these are clearly bluff-catchers, but wait – Don just saw me run a big bluff 48 hours earlier. Will this be the extra push he needs to call?
What I am sure of is that, if I’m going to bet, I need to polarize my sizing. Sell the idea that I have a monster (TT, Ah8h, etc) or busted hearts. By doing that, I put all of his bluff catchers in a tough spot. If I make a really value-y bet (B50, B70), then his weakest tens will fold without much thought (goes my thinking). But if I shove (B109), then it merges all of his tens into a single isomorphic team of bluff catchers.
If I jam, I am telling him that it doesn’t matter if he has AT or T9 – both are good, or neither is good.
For a river bet to be profitable, it has to win >50% of the time that it is called. You have to adjust that for the danger of getting raised, but if I jam, I can’t be raised.
I think that, based on our history earlier in the week, he may be tempted to call with his JTs and T9s. If he calls with those, then he’ll certainly call with AT, but I hoped that he would have open-raised some of his ATs preflop. I see more combos of worse tens than better ones.
I jammed for the remaining $850.
The immediate good news is that Don doesn’t snap-call, removing all the fours-full and eights-full (and one single nasty TT) from his range.
After 30 seconds, I begin to think I wanted a call, unless I had just value-owned myself against AT.
Around one minute, Don slides in calling chips and I turn over my hand.
Don shakes his head, and shows queen-ten. “You really owned me there.”
The table was in shock that I would make such a thin value shove. They asked me all kinds of questions, such as, “Weren’t you worried he had a full house?”
They forgot how I play Sixth Street.
This was a new, and unnerving play for me. I like to think that I frequently go for thin river value. But this idea of polarizing a medium-strength hand to gather all of his bluff-catching tens together – that was a new one.
I was proud of myself for exercising that new skill, and getting an extra $850 from Don.
“But Lee, what if Don had tank-called with ace-ten?”
Boy, did I ask myself that question. Would I have felt stupid for value-owning myself? All the best teachers tell us: “If you don’t occasionally value-own yourself, you’re not value betting thinly enough.”
Remember, for a bet to be profitable, it has to win >50% of the time that it’s called. Suppose a specific bet you make is good 60% of the time that it’s called. You’d be crazy not to make it. However, you also get called by a better hand 40% of the time. Thin value bettors need to be prepared to frequently be shown a winner.
I ran this hand by my friend and poker buddy, Tommy Angelo, and mentioned my concern about running into ace-ten. Because Tommy was a poker pro for many years and thinks carefully about such things, his response was insightful:
“I have used this on myself approximately a million times, so I’ll put it in first person. This is my standard internal dialogue…
“If he had turned over ace-ten, would I still be congratulating myself? After all, if my play was correct, it was correct against his range, and ace-ten is merely one of the hands in his range. So really, I should feel exactly as proud when I lose a hand like this as when I win, but that is never the case, not even close, so, what gives?”
I imagine “what gives” is that we humans are constitutionally unable to divorce results from satisfaction, no matter how clear and correct the process was. At least, humans Tommy Angelo and Lee Jones find it difficult to do so. This means that Tommy and I are still growing as poker players, and that is the most exciting takeaway from the entire experience.
So we closed the email thread with this:
Me: “How about we agree, coffee mugs raised, that we’d both be just as proud of me if he’d turned up ace-ten?”
Tommy: “Absolutely! There’s much to be proud of about this hand, and also excitement about what it says about the future.”
I promise that the next time I value-own myself in a hand such as this, I will post an article about it here. And try very hard to be proud of myself.
### TOPIC: squeezing tips
Being aggressive and punishing passive and weak play is the staple of any solid poker strategy. One play that fits perfectly into such an aggressive strategy is the squeeze play, which can be utilized with great effectiveness in both cash games and tournament poker.
Squeezing in poker is used by all good aggressive regulars, and if you watch the big cash game streams like HCL on a regular basis, you will see a lot of squeeze plays utilized by the best players in the games.
In this guide to squeeze playing, we are going to explain what squeeze play is, when and how to use it, and exactly what you can achieve by squeezing at the right time.
We will also take a look at some potential squeezing ranges to use in different scenarios, as well as appropriate bet sizes for squeezing in position and out of position, creating a fairly strong overall squeezing strategy.
The squeeze play is a potent preflop strategy involving a re-raise after an initial raise and one or more calls. When executed correctly, it can capitalize on opponents’ tendencies and increase your profitability.Key Takeaways:* Objectives: The primary goal is to exploit the “sandwich effect,” where the original raiser faces pressure from both the caller(s) and your re-raise, often leading to folds from hands that can’t withstand significant aggression.* Optimal Scenarios: Ideal situations for a squeeze include facing a loose initial raiser and one or more callers, especially when you’re in a later position, allowing you to leverage positional advantage.* Hand Selection: Construct your squeezing range with strong value hands (e.g., AA, KK, QQ, AK) and select bluffing hands that have good equity and blocker potential (e.g., suited connectors, suited aces).* Positional Considerations: Squeezing in position (e.g., from the cutoff or button) allows for a wider range, including more bluffing hands, due to the informational advantage. Out-of-position squeezes should be more value-heavy to compensate for the positional disadvantage.* Bet Sizing: Adjust your squeeze size based on position and the number of callers. In position, a smaller size may suffice, while out-of-position squeezes should be larger to exert maximum pressure.* Anticipating 4-Bets: Be prepared for opponents to respond with a 4-bet. Ensure your squeezing range includes hands strong enough to continue against further aggression, and have a plan for how to proceed if faced with a re-raise.Incorporating the squeeze play into your strategy can effectively exploit opponents’ weaknesses and enhance your overall game.
In the simplest of terms, squeeze play is defined as a re-raise you make over the top of a raise and one or multiple calls.
Anytime one player opens the pot with a raise, and at least one player makes the call, you have a chance to apply a squeeze play.
Some very aggressive players tend to squeeze extremely wide and try to play as many 3-bet pots in position as possible, especially when they play in very tight and passive games.
The squeeze play needs to be a part of your arsenal if you want to have any hope of being a big winner in your games, as it is an extremely effective play that can print money, especially in the less aggressive games at lower stakes.
So, if you are only just learning how to play poker on a higher level, introducing squeeze play into your overall strategy should give your overall winnings a fairly instant boost.
The biggest mistake that many players make with squeezing in poker is that they don’t quite understand why they are squeezing, so they end up squeezing way too many hands and in all the wrong spots.
The reality is that a squeeze play will always achieve one of the following:
When thinking about squeezing, you should always think about all of these scenarios and how your hand is going to play if your opponents don’t all end up folding.
This will come into play when we think about constructing our squeezing range, which will be made up of both value hands and particular bluffing hands, which make sense for this scenario, but more on that a bit later.
Picking the right time to squeeze in poker is a big part of making this play a part of a successful poker strategy.
While you can technically squeeze anytime someone raises and someone calls, you should not be that trigger-happy if you want to show a profit with your squeeze plays.
Many factors play a role in picking the spots to squeeze in, but the perceived opening range of the original raiser, as well as the ranges of the players who called the raise, should all be considered.
Even more so, you should consider your hand and whether or not it fits into the range of hands you want to be squeezing.
Your position at the table should also play a major role in the decision, as squeezing in position and out of position is not quite the same.
Finally, you should be mindful of stack sizes and think about whether or not you will have enough chips to make a call with the appropriate range when facing a 4-bet.
Before you put in those squeezing chips, think about all these elements, and don’t be afraid to take the time you need to process every bit of information before you put in the 3-bet.
Quite often, you will find yourself on the button facing a raise from one of the early or middle positions and a call from one of the late position players.
In a situation like this, you will want to construct a squeezing range that is made up of all your strongest hands and quite a few bluffing hands as well.
Your value hands in this scenario should include pairs from AA to QQ, AK, and AQ0. These hands are pure 3-bets, according to solvers, and generally should be well ahead of the ranges of both your opponents.
Again, you should sometimes re-consider squeezing the bottom of your value range when facing a raise from a tight player in one of the earlier positions, as they are quite likely to have a very strong hand.
To balance out all your strong hands, you will want to introduce quite a few bluffs into your squeezing range in position as well.
Solvers like hands like QJs and KJs, as well as hands like AJs, ATs, A5s, A4s KTs, K9s, J9s, and 76s at a lower frequency, and occasionally hands like 76s, 65s, and 54s.
Hands like A5s and A4s should also serve as great squeezing candidates, although solvers prefer hands like ATs, A9s, and A8s as bluffing hands in tournaments where stacks typically tend to be shallower, increasing the value of top pair.
Of course, the exact range you use for this play should depend heavily on the range you assign the original raiser, who is the most likely to have a strong hand and continue against your 3-bet.
Keep in mind that you should also not fold the combos of these suited bluffing candidates that you decide not to squeeze with but rather call with them, as well as all pocket pairs you aren’t 3-betting.
The exact range of hands you should squeeze within position will also change quite significantly if you are in the cutoff, as you will have to 3-bet somewhat tighter with yet another player behind you to worry about.
Playing out of position, you will want to apply a squeeze with a much tighter range than you can in position due to the obvious positional disadvantage.
This range will still include all your strong hands like AA-JJ, AK, and AQs, but also hands like 99 and 88 at a much higher frequency, especially in tournaments.
According to the solvers, GTO poker also suggest you bluff with hands like AJs, ATs, AQ, KQs-KTs, QJs, JTs, and some weaker-suited connectors in tournaments, while hands like A5s-A2s are typically not included in the small blind squeezing ranges.
Generally speaking, you will want to make your squeeze plays more value-heavy when playing out of position while still adding some bluffs into the range to ensure balance.
Also, keep in mind that squeezing from the big blind should be done at a much lower frequency, as the discount you are getting on a call gives you many more opportunities to call with a variety of hands instead of 3-betting.
Winning the pot outright with your squeeze play is always a favorable outcome and one that you want to see happen as often as possible.
To make that possible, you need to make sure that you are not making your squeeze plays too small and not giving your opponent good odds on calling you.
Imagine a hand at a $2/5 cash game table where the hijack raises to $15, the cutoff calls, and you squeeze to $45.
In this scenario, either of your opponents needs to call just $30 to play for a pot of $105, meaning they are getting excellent pot odds and only need less than 30% equity to continue with their hand, compelling them to continue with the vast majority of their raising range.
If you were to raise to anywhere between $60 and $75, the odds you would be giving your opponents would be much less favorable, making it less likely you will get called.
Typically speaking, you will want to raise around full pot anytime you are squeezing in position and a bit more than the pot when out of position to account for your positional disadvantage.
Keep in mind that the size of the pot and the size you should be making your squeeze plays will both go up as more callers are involved, but your squeezing range should tighten up a bit for every new caller in the hand.
For instance, you will want to have slightly fewer bluffing hands in your squeezing range when 3 players call the original raise, but you will also want to make your squeeze significantly bigger.
While the most favorable outcome of a squeeze play is generally to have all players fold their cards, the least favorable is usually getting 4-bet.
Since you have many bluffs in your squeezing range, getting 4-bet means you can’t just play for all your chips every time it happens.
Obviously, you are going to want to put your chips into the pot with your strongest hands like AA, KK, AKs, and QQ, barring extreme reads or circumstances.
However, your suited Broadway hands and pocket pairs will usually want to continue for a call, provided the 4-bet is not too big, while hands like AQ or KQ without suits should generally be folded.
You can also fold hands like A5s-A2s in some cases (and use them as 5-bet bluffs in others) while calling a big chunk of your range, especially in position.
If you are out of position, you will definitely want to call much tighter and only continue with the best-suited connectors like QJs and JTs, while folding suited hands with gaps that don’t play well enough after the flop.
Squeeze play is an essential play in any strong No Limit Texas Hold’em poker strategy and one you should spend a fair bit of time studying.
We have broken down the most basic elements of squeezing in poker in this guide, but there is plenty of room to work on your squeezing game and achieve perfection.
You will want to run simulations of squeeze plays from and against different positions to figure out the ideal squeezing ranges for every scenario that you can walk into, along with ranges for different effective stack sizes.
If you stick with it long enough, you will get very close to squeezing with optimal ranges in every situation and intuitively recognizing the situations in which a squeeze play works better than a call or a fold.
Start working on your squeezing game today and building on the foundations we set forth in our guide, and you will be on your way to joining the ranks of elite poker players in no time.
### TOPIC: suited connectors
Suited connectors are some of the most overplayed hands in poker, with many players often saying things like “I’d rather have 87s than AK” and playing their suited connectors as if they were the nuts.
Suited connectors have their place in the game of Texas Hold’em and can be very profitable hands, but only when played correctly and at the right time.
On the other hand, these hands can also be extremely expensive when misplayed on a regular basis, which is a trap novice players fall into.
If you want to build a strong game and consistently win, you will need to learn how to play your suited connectors. In this article, we will share the best tips on how to play suited connectors correctly and stop leaking chips in unprofitable situations.
This may seem like a very basic question to ask, but before we can talk about how to play them, we need to clearly define suited connectors.
Suited connectors are connected cards of the same suit, which include card combinations such as T9s, 87s, and 54s. Hands like T8s or 64s are not suited connectors, and this is an important thing to keep in mind.
When playing, players often forget about this very important concept and play the various suited gappers like suited connectors, which causes them to play way too wide of a poker range.
For example, opening a hand like 98s with a 100bb stack from an early position is acceptable in terms of theory, but opening 97s in the same spot is too loose.
If you take a look at the optimal preflop charts, you will notice that suited connectors are some of the first hands added into various opening and 3-betting ranges, while suited gappers only come into play when the ranges are significantly wider.
So, keep in mind that when talking about suited connectors, we are only referring to hands that have no gaps between the cards, which is a fairly condensed range of card combos.
Just like there is a difference between suited connectors and suited gappers, there is also a difference between high and low suited connectors.
There are many reasons that high suited connectors are better to play in almost all scenarios than low ones, and this is clearly reflected in the optimal ranges across the board.
Whether you look at opening, 3-betting, or calling ranges, you will notice that solvers prefer higher suited connectors over lower ones in all situations.
Some of the reasons higher suited connectors are preferred include:
Small suited connectors like 65s or 54s may have the same chance to flop a pair or a draw as the higher ones, but the pairs and draws they make are much weaker.
For example, 54s has only a 1% chance of flopping top pair. On most boards, flopping a pair with such a hand means very little, as such a pair is rarely the best hand by showdown.
What’s even more, straight and flush draws that low suited connectors make sometimes run into higher draws, which can lead to costly coolers.
Higher suited connectors like JTs and T9s, on the other hand, flop top pair a portion of the time and make straights and flushes that can end up being on the winning side of those same coolers.
Low-suited connectors are not very valuable, especially when playing loose and splashy games. They lose much of their fold equity and can put you in difficult situations.
One of the most common mistakes poker players make is that they treat their suited connectors the same regardless of table position.
However, there is a huge difference in your ability to profitably play suited connectors from early position compared to late position.
In fact, only the best of suited connectors are fit to be played from early position, almost regardless of stack depth and game type.
You will still want to open your QJs, JTs, T9s, and perhaps 98s from UTG and UTG+1 at almost all stack depths, but all lower suited connectors should be discarded.
The chances of getting 3-bet and being forced to fold your hand or play it out of position are too high with baby suited connectors, which is why the safest course of action is to simply fold them and only play when your hand has a reasonable potential to flop top pair along with all the drawing possibilities.
As your position gets better, so do the prospects of playing suited connectors if you are not facing a raise from one of the earlier positions.
A quick glance at our deeper stack tournament preflop opening charts will show you that the optimal course of action is to raise nearly all suited connectors from the button and very close to all of them from the cutoff and hijack.
When raising first from one of the late positions, you have a very reasonable chance of winning the blinds or getting heads up with the big blind, both of which are favorable scenarios.
Even hands as weak as 54s can do reasonably well in such scenarios, as they will flop enough equity on the flop, while your preflop raise will allow you to represent a big hand on a variety of flops.
In fact, GTO poker solvers recommend playing a ton of suited gappers as well from later positions, especially the button, for the same reasons.
If your cards are suited and reasonably well-connected, they are good enough to open for a raise from the button or the cutoff, as long as you have some chips left behind to work with.

So far, we have discussed how to play suited connectors as the first player into the pot. Now, it is time to think about what to do when we are facing a raise.
The way to continue with suited connectors against a raise should depend on your position, the effective stack depth, and the game type you are playing.
Tournament and cash game strategies differ quite a bit in this particular area, as chip conservation is much more important in tournament poker, while cash games are played purely for cEV.
Looking at solver outputs, you will notice that the optimal strategy in tournament poker recommends a lot of calling with suited connectors against a raise, while cash game strategy prefers 3-betting or folding the majority of suited connected hands.
Low suited connectors such as 65s or 54s are almost always to be folded in cash games, while some of the higher ones like JTs and T9s act as great bluffing candidates in some spots.
Playing from the small blind, cash game strategy recommends only playing T9s+ in terms of suited connectors and always 3-betting when you decide to continue with these hands.
In tournament poker, lower and middling suited connectors can act as good bluffing candidates, while higher suited connectors can be called against early position raises.
The strategy changes completely in the big blind, regardless of the game type, as suited connectors become obligatory continues, with your only dilemma being whether to call or raise them.
For a more detailed look into the particulars of how to play your suited connectors against a raise, we recommend having a look at the preflop charts for your game of preference and examining how calling and 3-betting ranges change based on position and stack depth.
We have discussed how to play suited connectors as the original raiser and when facing a raise in different positions. However, there are many different scenarios to discuss, and it would not be possible to teach you all there is in a few short paragraphs.
If you want to truly master playing suited connectors in different scenarios, you should refer to our preflop charts and study how your ranges should change based on position, stack size, and action.
But even before you master all the ranges and know exactly how to play your suited connectors in every situation, here are a few tips you can keep in mind to make your decisions easier and get better results with your suited connectors:
Position is crucial in any poker situation, but it becomes even more so when playing suited connectors.
A good chunk of suited connectors’ value comes from their potential to flop draws and implied odds. Both of these things are best utilized in position.
Playing suited connectors out of position too often will cause you to bleed chips and fall into many uncomfortable situations that you simply can’t make profitable, no matter how hard you try.
For that reason, you should limit yourself from getting too involved with such hands when out of position and even fold them until you feel comfortable with your ranges and understand how you will proceed postflop on various boards.
Whenever you raise or 3-bet with suited connectors, remember that part of your goal is to leverage your fold equity to get players to fold better hands.
This means it is essential to play suited connectors in spots where your opponents are capable of folding their cards, and this is especially true when you choose to 3-bet.
If you are playing against particularly splashy opponents who don’t like to fold to 3-bets, re-raising with suited connectors makes little sense, as you won’t be able to make them fold, and you won’t have the best hand going to the flop.
If you want to get aggressive with suited connectors, do so against players who are capable of folding a better hand to your raise, as well as those who will not continue enough on the flop.
Making a low straight or trips in a 3-bet pot may sound like the optimal scenario to stack your opponents, but the truth is it simply doesn’t happen that often.
What’s even more, even when you do make a big hand with low suited connectors, your opponent will often simply not have a big hand and decide to give up on the flop or the turn, and you won’t be getting all of their chips.
Instead of dreaming of the perfect cooler setup where you win all the chips, you should be thinking about how your hand plays long-term across different boards that could come.
For this reason, high suited connectors that have the potential to flop top pairs, overcards, and high straight and flush draws make for much better hands to play before the flop.
The next time you look down at 54s UTG in a splashy cash game, fold your cards and wait for a better spot to come along.
Depending on position and stack sizes, you will want to raise at least some suited connectors in almost all situations. However, that does not mean you have to get married to them.
If you end up facing a 3-bet after opening the pot with your suited connectors, it is perfectly acceptable to fold your cards and move on to the next hand.
It can be very tempting to take your suited connectors to the flop against a 3-bettor and try to win a big pot, but the truth is you won’t get that chance often enough.
Your opponent will usually continue with a c-bet after a preflop 3-bet, and you will not hit the board often enough with your connectors to be able to continue past the flop.
If facing an extremely small re-raise, you may be priced into a call, but unless the stacks are very deep and you know your opponent is extremely likely to pay you off when you make a big hand, try not to get too involved with suited connectors when you face resistance.
When you play a pot with suited connectors and get action, you are usually not a favorite against your opponent’s range.
However, by playing your suited connectors aggressively, you will be able to make players fold better cards before the flop and continue to fold their cards on flops and turns even when you don’t improve.
Suited connectors have a high chance of flopping various draws, which makes them just good enough to keep barreling with on a lot of flops and turns.
If you are not ready to be aggressive and make those bigger bets on later streets, don’t bother opening suited connectors in the first place, as you simply won’t be able to make a big hand often enough.
Playing suited connectors may seem simple enough, but the truth is they are one of the most complex hand groups in all of poker.
While you will definitely have to include suited connectors into your ranges across the board, knowing which of them to use in which spots is a whole science in itself.
You will learn how to improve your selection of suited connectors as you advance in your poker strategy, but for the time being, remember that high suited connectors are almost always worth playing, while the lower ones only work when you can maximize your fold equity with them.
If suited connectors sound a bit scary right now, ease into it, play only the best combinations, and expand your ranges to include the weaker ones as well as your comfort levels rise. This way, you will learn how to maneuver the streets like the pros.
### TOPIC: value betting aces on river
Here’s a hand about value betting aces that comes from the PokerCoaching Discord cash discussion channel. Our hero, Ibney, is in the hijack position in a live $1/$2 NLHE game. The UTG player opens to $10, and Ibney finds two red aces – excellent start to a Texas Hold’em hand. He makes it $30. Things go slightly astray as the small blind (SB) cold-calls the $30, and the original opener calls as well. For the purposes of this hand, we can treat the effective stacks as $420 (210 BBs).
Before we go further, I want to note that the SB almost certainly made a mistake. That is, there is a compelling argument that, facing a cold 3-bet, the small blind should either fold, or put in a cold 4-bet. If you see somebody cold-calling 3-bets, particularly if you see it more than once, they’re likely a weak player. But the SB didn’t post this hand – our hero, Ibney, in the hijack, did.

Ibney finds themselves at a three-way flop with $90 in the pot. The flop is
T♠️-8♠️-7❤️
The SB checks, but now UTG leads $25 into the $90 pot (a bet of 28% of the pot or “B28”). This “donk” lead is generally not game theory optimal strategy, and the solver confirms that UTG should be “checking range” on this flop. But the rules of the game permit them to lead out, and so they did.
I find that such donk leads are usually one of two things: either a marginal hand, such as a weak top pair that wants to “see where it’s at,” or a draw that wants to set its price for a turn card.
Since Ibney is beating all draws and all top pairs at this point, it’s tempting to raise. However, the SB is still in the mix, and their range often contains “medium pocket pairs” – they could have flopped a set. Given that we have the effective button, I think it’s fine to flat the bet and see what the SB wants to do.
Ibney agrees and calls the $25 bet. Unfortunately, the SB calls as well. It would have been more comforting had they folded. So here we are with $165 in the pot, and the turn is the 3♦️, making the board:
T♠️-8♠️-7❤️–3♦️
The good news is that both players now check, giving our hero a massive poker range advantage and all but promising that Ibney has the best hand. We are off the Machine rails with the multi-way nature of the pot, and UTG donking into the flop, so let’s retreat to basics:
We almost definitely have the best hand, and we have many clear value targets: good top pairs such as KT, QT; pair+draw such as T9, 98; and any combination of two spades. There’s part of me that wants to make an overbet, perhaps $225 into the $165 pot (B136) – our hand is almost certainly best and our opponents are likely to be inelastic about calling with all of the hands I listed above. But multi-way pots demand smaller bet sizes, and we do, in fact, have one pair.
Ibney chooses to bet $100 (B60) on the turn, and I can’t fault him for this.
The SB finally folds (having squandered $55 on their failed adventure) and UTG calls.
We get to the river and there’s $365 in the pot. The river is the 4♦️, making the final board:
T♠️-8♠️-7❤️–3♦️-4♦️
UTG checks again, and Ibney says, “I sit here wondering what will possibly call a shove for value.”
I had a reply ready for this:
Suppose you are (a) heads-up, (b) in-position, (c) on the river, and (d) you have a value hand. If your opponent checks to you, do not try to figure out what worse hand can call. Make that their problem.
This is known (by me, anyway) as the “Lee Jones Their Problem Maxim.”
Poker players can be incredibly creative when finding excuses to call in cash game poker. Furthermore, you have the infamous “calling demon” on your side, whispering into their ear a handful of reasons why they need to put money in the pot.
This is where good targeting can be invaluable. Ask yourself, “What is the most KT will call?” Then bet that. Maybe you’re wrong and KT won’t call, but you’re freerolling at this point – it’s highly likely a better hand would have raised at some point in the dance.
This hand is particularly nice because a jam is $275 into $365 – it’s B75, offering UTG 2.3:1 to call. With a plethora of missed draws, the calling demon will have a field day with the UTG player. And they can’t check/raise you because you’re all-in.
As it turns out, Ibney checked their aces back, UTG showed QT for top pair, and Ibney won the pot. That’s nice, but let’s say there was a 60% chance that UTG would have called a $275 shove. That’s $170 that Ibney left in their opponent’s stack that should have been in theirs.
I’m not writing this article to insult Ibney – they posted their hand specifically to ask the question if they could have gotten more value with a river bet. But I see this behavior all the time – somebody who has a clear value hand trying to get inside their opponent’s head and figure out the hands with which they could call.
Make that their problem – pick a reasonable value target, ask yourself what kind of pot odds your opponent need to call. Put simply, try to figure out how much they will pay, and bet that.
Then sit back and let your opponent and the calling demon have some quiet time together.
### TOPIC: when not to use gto
In the modern era of poker, it is quite common to come across poker players who live and die by Game Theory Optimal (GTO) poker strategies. GTO poker is certainly worth studying if you want to play the best in the world, but how well does it translate to low stakes poker tournaments and cash games? Remember: if your opponents are not playing a GTO strategy, a lot of GTO principals go out the window. While that’s all well and good, how do we know when it is the proper time to deviate from GTO? In this article, I will share a number of hands that illustrate optimal spots to not play a GTO poker strategy.
This hand shows an adjustment many successful mid-stakes players are capable of making.
With 50 big blinds in the early stages of a large field poker tournament, a nitty player in the lojack raises and it folds around to you in the big blind holding A♠-7♣. You call making it heads-up heading to the flop.
The flop comes Q♠-7♦-4♣ giving you second pair. You check-call the preflop aggressor’s small continuation bet.
The turn is the 5♥, you check and your opponent sizes up with a 3/4 pot bet. According to a GTO solver, folding here would be incredibly tight, but facing a nitty opponent this is a good spot to deviate from GTO and exploitatively fold.
When a turn card favors you, but a nit continues betting, the vast majority of the time they have a good hand they will continue betting with. Assessing the board, not only are there few bluffs your opponent would continue betting with, but there are also few river cards where you would be comfortable calling another bet. Remember: nits do not bluff enough. If he happens to be firing with A-K, god bless him, but more often than not such players are betting with hands that beat you.
If you are facing a capable opponent, call and stick around. Although this is not a fold that you should be making against population, when you recognize an opponent’s tendencies be willing to deviate from GTO to make exploitative folds.
This hand may be the most important one we cover in this article.
In the early stages of a poker tournament, it folds to you in the cutoff with 50 big blinds. You raise holding 9♠-9♥, and get three-bet by the player on the button. Despite your decent stack size, GTO will tell you that this is a shove. While it may seem insane to risk 50 big blinds with pocket nines, if you are facing proficient players who are capable of three-bet bluffing a wide range, this is a great spot to either flip for stacks or scoop a bunch of dead money preflop when they fold.
While ripping here is optimal facing a good poker player, if the player on the button is a nit the correct play differs. Facing a nit, going all-in would be out of the question, in fact it would be insane!
Most nits, if they three-bet bluff at all preflop, only do so with ⅓ of the hands they should be three-bet bluffing with. Instead of taking a risky line against a nit, you are better off calling and playing passively postflop. While you are not playing to purely set mine with your pocket nines, facing a tight nit play your hand more cautiously than you would facing a capable player.
In this hand, a huge whale in the lojack raises and it folds to you on the button holding 8♠7♦ (100 big blinds effective). So far in this tournament, you have seen the lojack play a number of hands, and can already tell they are terrible. Considering the fact the lojacks sucks and both the blinds happen to be passive players, you call with your unsuited connectors.
This serves as an example of how GTO solvers fail to account for an important variable: player talent. GTO does not know the difference between a fish and Phil Ivey, making it critical you recognize when you have an edge and should move away from GTO. If you know you have a skill edge when facing another player, look for opportunities to play heads-up with them even if it is not solver approved.
The next hand we will dissect covers a common flop spot that many good poker players may overlook and play the same way every time.
With 100 big blinds in the early stages of a poker tournament, it folds around to you on the button and you raise holding Q♠-10♣. Only the big blind calls.
The flop comes 10♥-6♣-4♦ and your opponent checks.
A lot of well-studied poker players will continuation bet on this flop nearly 100% of the time. While making a small continuation bet with top pair is not a bad play, doing it every time is not an ideal strategy. Although it may seem very passive, not only is this a spot worth checking back, but you should check nearly half the time.
When you have top pair with an overcard serving as a weak kicker, you are in an optimal spot to check back. It may seem like you are giving up equity with top pair, but by holding an overcard you help block possible turn cards that can give your opponent a better pair.
Considering your opponent’s tendencies when assessing whether to check or bet, you are much better off checking against competent opponents and betting against fishy ones. When you bet against a competent opponent, they are capable of executing check-raises and making a straightforward spot much more difficult to navigate. By checking, you avoid a potentially nasty spot while not giving up too much equity. If you are facing a fishy opponent, bet your top pair on the flop and target any worse pairs they may have picked up. You can’t expect a fishy recreational to create action, and even if they did it would be cause for concern!

You are in the first level of a WSOP poker tournament with a deep stack of 200 big blinds. The lojack raises, drawing calls from the cutoff, the big blind, and you in the small blind holding 5♠4♠.
The flop comes K♠-8♥-4♣. After you and the big blind check, the preflop aggressor makes a bet for slightly more than half pot. After the cutoff folds, you have a perfectly scripted check-raise bluff spot. Despite the big blind still being in the hand, with bottom pair and runner-runner potential you can profitably check-raise bluff and potentially induce a fold from the lojack.
You check-raise, and only the lojack calls making it heads-up.
The turn card is the 3♦, essentially a brick card for you. While you can fire the turn and river in hopes of spiking an out or getting a bluff through, consider the type of player the lojack is. If they are the kind of player who won’t fold a king, continuing to follow GTO and triple barreling could be a major punt!
When reviewing hand histories, I’ll see skilled poker players continue firing in similar spots despite the fact it is in their best interest to give up. Facing opponents who have the tendency to be calling stations, you would much rather give up when you fail to get additional equity on the turn. Giving up on bluffs may hurt sometimes, but you would much rather conserve your chips than dump them off unnecessarily.
Let’s consider another preflop spot, but from the blinds.
It folds to you in the small blind, and you have K♠-10♠ with a passive nit to your left. Any experienced poker player who frequently studies GTO knows that strategies can get complex when playing from the blinds. Some hands you limp, some hands you raise, with all sorts of mixing in between. While this is all well and good against other skilled poker players, facing a passive nit there is no need to get fancy. It’s simple: facing passive nits from the blinds, ignore GTO limping ranges and exploit by raising with good hands. When playing against weak opponents, there is no need to play an overly refined strategy. Play a more implementable strategy, even if it goes against GTO.
The following hand may be one some players find to be an “easy” spot, but it is one I often see my students miss when playing poker tournaments. Unlike other hands featured in this article, this is a preflop spot where you should be playing GTO, despite it being a spot that is often overlooked.
With 50 big blinds in the early-middle stages of a poker tournament, the lojack raises and draws calls from both the cutoff and the button. Holding Q♥-J♥ in the small blind, you have a decision to make. While many poker players simply flat to see the flop, they fail to seize an opportunity to scoop a lot of dead money. Even though you have 50 big blinds, this is an optimal spot to move all-in. Especially at the low and mid-stakes, this shove prints a lot of equity. While it may seem crazy to shove with this stack size, consider a few things…
Out of all of the opponents that remain in the hand, the one you have to worry about the most is the initial raiser. While you may be behind some of the hands in their range, you are also alive or flipping against others like A-K, pocket tens, and pocket nines. There are also a wide variety of hands that are ahead of you that you can force to fold, like A-Q offsuit.
Both of the preflop callers have incredibly capped ranges, making them prime targets to go after with a preflop shove. Unless they are incredibly tricky limpers, both of these players will fold the vast majority of the time, especially if the initial raiser decides to call.
What makes this shove so effective is that the vast majority of the player population does not have this play in their game. Most players witnessing this shove will assume you have pocket jacks or better, and will willingly forfeit the pot folding hands that may have you beat. This same shove can be made with J-10 suited, as well as low-suited aces.
Skilled poker players who are profitable at the low to mid stakes may be wary of this shove, citing how they are sacrificing the edge they have against the field. While you may be the best player at a given poker table, that does not change the fact that this is a +EV shove that has low variance overall. Roughly, all three opponents will fold 80% of the time. Rather than call or squeeze to play this spot out of position, you can take advantage of a GTO-approved spot that rewards you with lots of dead money.
It has never been more fun to play live cash games. With the growing popularity of live streamed productions like Hustler Casino Live, no-limit hold’em cash game variations like the Stand-Up Game create unique spots for players to master. While such game variations are fun and help create action at the poker table, they also create spots that are not “solved” with GTO. It would certainly be helpful to know the optimal play to make when playing the Stand Up Game or when there are more than two blinds in play, but such “solves” are not currently available to players.
When studying poker using GTO solvers, it is important to consider what the solver assumes when providing you with outputs. Being based around GTO, solvers assume the opponents you are facing are also adhering to a GTO strategy. If you regularly play low stakes poker tournaments and cash games, you know a lot of the player population does not play a GTO strategy. The farther you go down the decision tree, the more GTO decisions the solver assumes your opponent has made. If your opponents make plays that greatly deviate from GTO, the best way to counter is by knowing when to deviate from GTO yourself.
Let’s consider a spot where you are dealt what many poker players consider their least favorite hand: pocket jacks.
Early in a poker tournament, UTG+1 raises and immediately gets three-bet 3x by the lojack. It folds to you in the big blind, and you look down at pocket jacks. GTO says you should mix in this spot, but I recommend deviating from GTO and having your pocket jacks be a pure fold. You may not mind having an excuse to fold pockets jacks preflop, but let’s consider why.
The common player population often does not three-bet enough from the lojack when facing a UTG+1 raise. Based on this knowledge, there is a high probability that your pocket jacks are well behind what the lojack and UTG+1 may be holding. Even if you are ahead, if both opponents call how confident are you playing multi-way out of position with a deep stack behind? Want to make poker easier? Make pocket jacks a pure fold in this spot.
In some hands, it is better to let your opponent’s tendencies and skill level dictate your decisions as opposed to GTO.
Let’s consider a hand where we are playing from the big blind and out of position postflop.
It folds around to the button, who makes and standard raise. Following a fold from the small blind, you look down at A♣-9♥ with 40 big blinds effective and call.
The flop comes A♠-6♥-2♣ giving you top pair. You check, and your opponent makes a 200 continuation bet.
The majority of the player population calls in this spot, despite the fact GTO wants us to check-raise frequently. Although both decisions are fine, this is a spot where it is important to consider your opponent’s tendencies before acting.
Against good opponents, you will be floated by wide ranges if you elect to check-raise. Good opponents will call with pairs and suited broadways, and will assume you are capable of bluffing if they believe you to be competent.
Although this is an optimal check-raise spot against capable opponents, be less inclined to check-raise for value when facing fishy opponents. While you can certainly continue check-raising with your bluffs and nutted hands (two pairs and sets), hands at the bottom of your value range like A♣-9♥ play better as check-calling hands. Why is this the case? Well, if you happen to be behind, you may lose more money than necessary by check-raising. At 40 big blinds, novice opponents are capable of felting you with a better ace by the river. While your hand is decent, it is not strong enough to play for stacks. Also, some opponents may cite the lack of aces in your range as a reason to barrel off with some bluffs. If you know your opponent is capable of bluffing, make your life easier by check-calling rather than raising.
One thing that GTO provides poker players is a sense of security and validation. If a particular play is “GTO solver approved”, you may feel a sense of pride in the fact you, in theory, played a particular spot perfectly. While nailing certain GTO frequencies can certainly take you far in poker, they can also blind you from spots where GTO should be ignored. Even when you execute the perfect GTO-approved bluff, if you are facing an “old man coffee” calling station, such bluffs can actually be total punts! If you attempt a GTO play against the wrong opponent, it doesn’t matter if GTOWizard approved, because you may very well be out of the tournament. For small to mid-stakes poker players looking to crush the average player population and eventually move up stakes, by all means study GTO, but be sure to recognize when to play exploitive strategies. By optimally blending both GTO and exploitative concepts, you can develop a poker strategy that will take you far on the felt.
