### TOPIC: cbetting on high card boards
We recently covered a complete strategy for c-betting on ace-high boards, and now we will dive deeper into high-card flops from KsQs9d to Jh6d2s.
Like before, we will use PeakGTO to analyze these examples. We will cover both connected and dry boards while being IP and OOP so you will fully understand how to play in these situations. Let’s jump straight into the hands.
In Position (IP) on Dry Boards (e.g., J♥6♦2♠): C-bet approximately 74% of the time, favoring a larger bet size of around 2/3 pot. This approach helps deny equity and applies pressure on the big blind’s weaker holdings.In Position on Connected/Wet Boards (e.g., K♥7♣6♣): Reduce c-bet frequency to about 59%, often opting for smaller bet sizes. The increased connectivity and potential draws warrant a more cautious approach, with a balanced range including top pairs and bluffs.Out of Position (OOP) on Dry Boards (e.g., K♥6♠2♦): Despite being out of position, c-bet around 60% of the time, primarily using larger bet sizes (~2/3 pot) to leverage range advantage.Out of Position on Connected/Wet Boards (e.g., K♠Q♠9♦): Decrease c-bet frequency to approximately 46%, favoring smaller bet sizes (~1/3 pot). The presence of potential draws necessitates a more conservative strategy, incorporating strong hands and bluffs without showdown value.
While the strategy changes based on your position and opening ranges since you play more hands from the BTN than in earlier positions, many of the underlying principles work similarly.
Therefore, we will concentrate on examples with wide ranges and cover situations when we open from the BTN and get called by the big blind. Here are assumptions we will be using:
Let’s take an example of Jh6d2s and see how our strategy looks on this dry board.
In this situation, we should be c-betting with 74% of our range, usually picking the bigger size of 2/3rds of the pot. That said, we also use small sizing quite a bit so we will have to mix between these two options.
Increasing c-bet size helps deny your opponent’s equity and put him in much tougher situations with overcards and runner runner draws.
As you can see, the entire betting range uses a mixed strategy, but some of the highest-frequency bets are overpairs, strong top-pairs, and even second pairs with an overcard to the board. These bets are accompanied by gutshots and some runner-runner draws for balance.
Similar strategy applies for Kxx and Qxx boards. As a rule of thumb, the lower the highest card, the less often you will be c-betting.
If we take the example of a more connected board like Kh7c6c, we will have to make some adjustments.
The most obvious difference is that we will now be checking back more often, and our c-betting range is only 59% in this situation. We will also want to use smaller bet sizes more often than big ones, which might initially be counterintuitive.
Our betting range is fairly mixed here as well, but you want to be c-betting top pairs most of the time.
What is interesting is that a game theory optimal strategy is using your air hands such as Q9s, J5s, and even small Ax hands as a bluff. Since BB should be 3-betting most of the strong Kx hands preflop, we can get away with this strategy and get many folds.
When you find yourself out of position, you will need to adjust your approach significantly and check more hands, so let’s analyze a few examples with these assumptions:
Let’s firstly look at the dry board of Kh6s2d.
Even being OOP, the solver suggests betting around 60% of the time. It also clearly favors big bet sizes, picking a 2/3 pot size bet in almost all situations because of a significant range advantage.
With the mixed strategy across the board with the same hands betting some of the time and checking the rest, it is not easy to group specific hands that you want to play one way or another. One thing that we can distinguish is that you want to be c-betting your top-pairs a lot of the time, and add air hands with a runner runner potential as the bluffs.
If we go to more connected boards and take KsQs9d as an example, our c-betting % shrinks even further.
Here we end up c-betting around 46% of the time, this time almost always picking small sizing of around 1/3rd of the pot.
While we end up using a mixed strategy here as well, you should end up c-betting all of your strong hands around two-thirds of the time, followed with bluffs that do not have any showdown value.
It is worth noticing that in situations where there is no flush draw on the board you will need to c-bet much more frequently. For instance, if we take the same flop cards but make it KsQh9d, you need to c-bet over 80% of the time since your opponent will have significantly fewer hands with the right pot odds where they can profitably continue.
