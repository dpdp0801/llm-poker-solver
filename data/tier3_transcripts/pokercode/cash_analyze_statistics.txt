### TOPIC: cash analyze statistics
 Talking about stats and HUD today, it's as always those very general topics that are cool for even players that are on maybe a little earlier in their poker career, in the beginnings. Or like, I always have the option to go like super deep or to talk about basic stuff. Today, I focus a little more on the basic stuff and this is what we will be going through together first quickly reminding ourselves Why can stats help us? Why are they cool? Why maybe in another instance? I know there was lots of talk and stuff on Twitter and stuff like that who follows Poker gossip there why why stats should not exist why huts should not exist like for example GG is not allowing huts But they offer like their own hud in a way for the last couple of hands with a couple of stats that is actually very helpful as well um you can download your stuff that you can see that um sites like the poker stars for example maybe lots of beginners play there as well uh they still allow basic huds with info about the hands you played. Back in the days when I mainly grinded like Zoom 200, Zoom 500, Zoom 1K, I obviously got millions of hands in and that led to situations where I had as much as like 50K hands on some opponents and you could really deeply analyze people. This is something I won't be talking about today so So it's more about the basic things. I will quickly talk about the Pyramid of Reads. This is something that if you're a PolkaCode member, you can find more regarding that in the first session regarding general concepts. It's on the platform, easy to find general concepts. Number one, and I think there's a second one as well. I'm briefly talking the pyramid of reeds there I need to put it in here because the stats and hut are part of that and is that the pyramid next to the one in Gizeh not not that close but even more beautiful I could say and then I will just talk a couple of stats my favorite stats and the most important ones so the basic ones are just the most important ones nothing nothing fancy they are the advanced ones maybe not everyone is using those but those are my favorite stats to gain more info about certain player types and then i'll obviously give you some examples regarding stats out of my database i hope i'm not too crazy with with showing showing too many stats of people that i collected hands against i tried to filter that a little around that i have like i'm not like i'm not the the idiot who shows how certain players are playing so yeah this is always like a filtered maybe it's last year maybe they they they evolved their game so i want to i want to play that one fear it's just they get used for examples and i'm not cutting out the names because then it's kind of kind of pointless just writing a couple of numbers and then as always i'll present the key takeaways to have you go enjoy your evening and maybe crush on the tables and yeah let's go let's talk about the why as always i like to keep it very very. I love when you guys are just asking questions. This is meant to be the free coaching for everyone. So there is no stupid question, right? If you're a beginner, you can ask me stuff right now, right here in the chat. I'm reading the chat on the side. So yeah, I will obviously mainly talk here. But still, I try to follow every question and I'll hopefully give you okay answers. And yeah, very, very easy to start with why are stats important instead of just playing whatever these days. We have GTO Wizard, we have programs that can tell us what is somewhat correct in a sense to play. But yeah, let's start with second point here. Just more information is just always better, right? If you know something, it has to be better than not knowing something. There is nothing like bad information. It just does not exist, right? So the evaluation of that information is what is your job there. Obviously, one piece of information can lead to you making something stupid that might not be right. But then this is up to you. It was not the information's fault. So yeah, we are used to incomplete information. We don't know much about the players we play. We don't know their hand. We don't know what they do with certain sizings and so on. So the more information we get is just better. If we know something about, I don't know how many hands they play, that would lead to a certain stat already, this is obviously beautiful for us. If we know whether they are mainly betting or how often they are calling, well, this is beautiful for us. And the reason why that is beautiful for us because we can start making money by exploitation so for everyone who is not already a poker code member and has seen most of my videos maybe some of you were watching like some other streams and i talk about that very very often i try to break down poker as often as possible to my favorite most simple game which is rock paper scissors right so yeah it's just we should know the equilibrium which is randomizing everything but just knowing something makes you crush just knowing that people take rock more often knowing that people take paper and so on right so and this is just based on the three questions we use all the time knowing what would be right so the question regarding that is what is right a second one what is villain doing wrong and this is where stats can help us and then our job what would be the right exploit is now what what we need to to figure out then all right first questions coming in here let me have a quick look deep into mord, how do you approach live game stats that you observe manually? Do you dismiss it because low sample? In live poker, I absolutely dismiss something like He 3-bets me twice. He 3-bets me the third time. It's like, I don't know. Maybe you play the full evening like six hours and you play 25 hands an hour, so you have 150 hands. That's an okay sample if you would track it for like VPIP, PFR, but this is just too tough, right? It's like I'm not sitting there with a pen and paper tracking everything. Maybe you get an, like it fits to the look that someone has has to the style what he's talking if there's an old man sitting with a coffee in vegas and reading newspaper min three betting and then playing no hands for for five hours straight well i know this guy is a nit and he won't invest anything without like queens plus ace king but yeah so so this this has to fit together in live poker i'm way way way more relying on showdowns so if I've seen The showdown like this guy open raised King-6 offsuit from the button well, what does it tell me if you are somewhat aware of ranges that like King-6 off open raise means that he's like Not sticking to GTO ranges, which would be like a 43, 44% button open race. He has to be at least at like 48, 50. If you see something crazy, like a nine, six off open race that you can easily find, uh, in, in, in live games. Well, then you know that he is like 65% plus, right? So, and then you can adjust towards that. So live poker, focus on the showdown this is the information that is not messed up and i make my conclusion conclusions from that all right how would you offset more information rake is better with streamlining our thought process protocols in game to find what is pertinent well usually you use birds i've never heard pertinent and most important i I actually don't understand the question to be honest. How would you offset more information is better with streamlining or other stuff. So if I get it right, right, we have our certain thought process and stats can influence us. Information can influence us. But we should be aware this is where like getting a good poker player well makes it way easier knowing way more about the game that you know what things mean Do you want to deviate a lot because of something this is kind of question number three? How do we exploit correctly? Right, you know like let's take the example someone you have we've seen someone open raise 9-6 offsuit from the button well, let's say we have the stat on some sample that he is just like VPI being high and like stealing a lot. lot well then i adjust my three betting range from the standard one to a range that i have in mind that i should play against someone who's opening 65 which is just way more because well we can go wider for value and just put more pressure on that range so this is something i think i hope that goes the right direction, but this is obviously tough to answer because that goes hand in hand, figuring out what villain is doing wrong and then knowing the right exploit. Zzz, do you know how GG had? I heard that the info there is only about last 50 hands, but when we click on a player profile, then we see sometimes different numbers of hands like 2000 or 245. Actually, I'm very, very confused as well. The stats you can see I think they are just 50 hands so VPIPPFR is interesting and that's about it. The other hands I don't know either because I'm not using it really in-game. I'm just playing too many tables to really look stuff up there. I know you can see like the biggest hands you played against someone that's sometimes a good reminder because that like I remember hands way better than names Oh, I played this and that against him and then maybe I remember the spot and whatever happened in that session But yeah still I want to show like there is something that we can still use. Hey Hansi great to have you in here Alright, so why stats we want to get more information. We figured out more information has to be better. There is no downside of having more information and we want to use that information to make the first deviations to have an idea, right? Alright, and now we talked about information right now and you asked questions regarding information. So this is the perfect moment for the pyramid of reads that is in here and what I did there is just like I wrote down and kind of a ranking how important information is for me and you can always compare that to two rock-paper-scissors right so it's like yeah let's start with the bottom one right the weakest read you can have is often you say like, you describe a hand to your friend, you say like, I have no read. Which is actually not true, no read does not exist. You know at least which game you were playing. It makes a difference whether you sit down and play NL5 or you sit down and play NL5000. This will be different. It will be a difference whether you go to a local casino somewhere in like the, I don't know, in the middle of nowhere in Texas or you go to a table in Vegas during a series where maybe some sharks are waiting for you as well. So something like NoRee does not exist, game will not play and so it's like the first information. The second level, I would say, is something that is, yeah, you can see very early. Some sites show it. I gave it here, like the nation read, the stack size read, limping read, just like you have seen him limping once. That tells you something, right? If you have a stack size, he sits down playing the zoom pool with 71 big blinds. This is like not a single regular I know is doing that. But there are some mid stacks, okay. But it's like, yeah, very likely he's a recreational. Nation read, maybe some nations are a little more passive. Some are a little more aggressive. Who knows? Maybe the Austrian flag just shows you that pretty much all the regulars from Europe are living in Austria now. So it's like, maybe you don't wanna have, you wanna play against that one so much and something like a flag from, I think, I don't know, like Lebanon is maybe a little better to play against on average, right? Obviously they are great players in Lebanon as well. So now important to figure out that the next point is the one we are talking about today and this is important to to figure out what stats show you exactly. This is something I did wrong in my earlier career because I took stats often as a given thing. Like I was saying this guy is playing like that. Like as if someone programmed the robot and he's playing like that. Nice, Pokorici. I'm not sure whether it works out like that, but yeah, sounds great. All right, so the stats we need to understand is the result of someone playing versus a certain pool. But obviously he doesn't need to play the same way against every single player. And I can always give you very easy examples. I'm over folding to three bets but I'm not over folding versus three bets if you're a good player. So my overall stat will always be over folding because like they are just way more bad players that are not three betting enough than they are like over aggressive maniacs. So I will always on average overfold but not versus the best players necessarily maybe against the very best again because i i i smell some post flop negative edge so that but this is a different thing so now don't take that as a guarantee the stats you're seeing maybe people are playing slightly different versus you this is more interesting when we talk about wrecks that you you play like every day so if you're an unknown you can kind of take those basic stats all right yeah now something that is an even better information is a play versus a hero-like player what is i think was always one the always one of the biggest benefits in my cash game career, as well as in my tournament career, is that I had lots of friends playing the same games. And actually, to be honest, right, from an American perspective or whatever, all those Germans were kind of the same, right? Maybe Fedor is a little special in that one direction, and let's say Dominic Nietzsche is a little special in the other direction. But to them, most of the Germans just like appearing in like some tournaments in 2016 to be like some friends of Fedor, some whatever and so on. So it's very obvious that they treated us kind of similarly. So it's a better read if I see someone like Ike Haxton play a hand versus Stefan Schilhabel than seeing him play a hand versus, I don't know, Cary Katz. It's just a better information because it tells me well this is probably more or less the same thing he would have done versus me. And then obviously the peak of the pyramid is the hands I actually play versus that certain player. So this is where he needed to show his real strategy. If someone is bluffing like crazy against me, well, he was bluffing like crazy versus me. I just know he did it against me, right? It's just like peak of the information, the best you can get. So now, obviously, when we talk about note-taking, about reads on, that's kind of hand, it goes hand in hand with HUD and stats and needs to fit together. This is what we look for, like those crazy reads, something that we know exactly and so on, but this is well usually not what is the case that we find. Usually we have like more, like more information that we need to interpret a little, we need to, yeah we are, we don't have certainty. And here I just want to put it in the right order that we know okay what is a huddle actually, what do stats actually mean and this is someone playing versus a pool of certain player. Even better if you know that pool of certain players. Alright, so but over folding plus CV hands also leaves money on the table even against tighter player because it has really zero ev even versus a fairly tight range. Well the range is shift right so let's let's let's quickly have a look at that. Maybe because this is a very good question. Some people some hands actually prefer to play against a tighter range and some hands actually prefer to play against a wider range. So just being tighter or looser in general, yeah, that doesn't change that much. Let's have a look at a very typical scenario, right? So we open raise the button, small blind folds and we talk about my favorite spot, big blind 3-bet. This is what the big blind should 3-bet. Ace-9 offsuit, Ace-7 offsuit, all that suited bullshit. Small blind folds and we talk about my favorite spot, big blind 3-bet. This is what the big blind should 3-bet. Ace-9 offsuit, ace-7 offsuit, all that suited bullshit, some Jack-5 suited, King-5 suited. Lots of players are forgetting those. They should raise big and you should fold pocket deuces, threes and fours. Why is that the case? Well, very, very easy. They're not making money if the villain has Jack-5 suited all the time, right? He bluffs you off if you don't have a set and he's not necessarily investing a whole stack when he has a set so Deuces threes and fours against someone who is too tight. I will end up calling every single time here because I just Yeah, well, I hit a set and I win a stack if he has like Queens plus all the time Well, I will I will stack him so it's just then it's a fine risk reward well and we can for example see that here I mean different range now but big blind versus under the gun deuces are a little more interested now they are indifferent this is how it's built up here with the sizings but this is just versus a tighter range but now let's have a look if someone is way too tight let Let's say someone is from the big blind 3-betting a range like that, which for lots of tight players is something that exists. People who only 3-bet 5% in that position do exist and they probably miss those spots here, those bluffs, and they have 100% ace-king, queens and maybe jacks, but that's about it it so it's even a stronger range what happens then is well that maybe your pocket peers get interesting but something like ace queen offsuit you see is like minus 0.8 but you see we're just talking about ranges i i didn't talk for a second about raising under the gun like i don't give a i have those hands from wherever and i just say big blind has this way too tight range that shifts my EV in the direction of hands that will know on the flop what's going on and takes it away from hands that will flop like second best hand, like ace, jack, king, queen. King, queen offsuit has to be horrible against the tight range. You see like losing minus 1.45. All right, birdie goat. I hope that answers the question. It's very very important to understand. Okay so now what I said before is that stats in a hud mean this is how villain plays versus a pool is that if someone folds way too much versus three bets it does not necessarily mean that you can hammer on him because maybe he's not over folding versus you right as long as you are unknown it's very very likely right as an unknown against good reg it's very very smart to over three bet from the big blind to start with because well every good player figured that out that you just can't over fold there but yeah just to know what's going on here all. I'll take a sip here and then we'll get to the first stats, I guess. Again, if there are any more questions like that, perfect question. Very good question. I'm happy to answer. We have plenty of time because actually I'll just give you a rundown of like, I think six stats that I presented. It's not more than that with a couple of examples. So today I don't need to rush through. I for your questions super happy to answer them and now let's get to the main stats the basic stats that should be part of every single hut if you like i always tell everyone the best hut you can use is the one that you built yourself right every hut you can just copy from somewhere will contain too much information. You building your hut will give you the decision which stats are you actually working with. If you're, how many hands do you need for position of three bet? I don't know, like 1500, 2000, I would say depends on how much people are three betting. You won You won't know whether someone is 3-betting 13% or 15% small blind versus button, but the overall picture will give you an idea. How would you expand a polar 3-bet range versus wider call versus 3-bet? Would you expand? If villains are calling too wide, that depends a lot. It's a lot about post-flop. As we have seen, if people just call those deuces, threes, fours in this spot, actually I want to have lots of shitty hands because he will overfold flops and turns all the time he doesn't have a set. So then I like having all my shit build a pot and barrel it off, and I just increase frequencies of those hands that will play well against that if someone is just like calling too wide on all ends I need to cut off my weakest three bets and just be stronger when we when I put money in a pot all right so let's get back main stats basic so I was just talking about that the best HUD you can use is the one you build yourself. Because everything that you didn't put in your HUD is information you are not using anyways. Let's say I actually started with copying HUD from, I don't know, from like the standard whatever. From Holdementor back then. I don't even know. So let's get two stars because they we have more stats. And then I extended it, extended it. And then like my baseline was node caddy edge. And at some point then I added even more customized stats. I got there. Oh, there's lots of red numbers. All right. So weird filters. Okay. So let's take this. Yeah. Right. So this is now a basic one. It had like, I had like two, three more panels for like special stats and so on. Oh, and a 50. And now like actually I went down to something basic again, because I don't have those 50,000 hands on anyone I'm ever playing pretty much. So this is important. For beginners, obviously this looks like a very, very big HUD. But for me, like i i built this myself i know exactly where it is where what is and i just like you can just like screen it and i have an idea what i mean i know which what every number means but just like screening that i gives you gives you just the rough estimate if you're just so used to it all right so just to quickly show quickly show that. Sober at three o'clock during a series. I didn't play a single tournament. How to find out if villain has flatting range on the button? What stat is that? Well, flat button versus cutoff or a three bet button versus cutoff. To know that, but you will get like just seeing him flat once is a better read than any stat. Like so this is something I'm just writing down, for example. But we'll talk about that in a second, because we can figure that out with just easy basic stats as well, or have a good guess. All right, so now let's talk about these basic stats that everyone knows, but I want to tell you how important those are. So those are very, very important for a couple of reasons because there's no big data needed. But a couple of hands can tell you already just remembering someone or having stats on someone from the last sessions, having 40, 50 hands, and you already know VPIP and PFR, which are obviously the first two ones, will help you for 50 hands. That's very, very good. Because it's very reliable. It reliable. There's not big variance in those. You won't know whether they play 27-19 or they play 24-20 but you know whether they are crazy or not. This is what we need to use for mainly the detection of outliers. This is what I want to call it. It's just figuring out is there like a really bad player at our table, which is the most important thing. And yeah, actually I'm already talking about the stats. We'll get there in a second. And this is why all the basic stats will be pre-flop. Everything else doesn't matter. And let's start with the VPIP. Let's quickly go through those things that everyone knows. Because we are here in the free coaching, even beginners are hopefully in here. and with the vpip let's let's quickly go through those things that everyone knows because we are here in the free coaching even beginners are hopefully in here and vpip everyone can google it everyone should know by now is voluntary put money into pot right so just someone invested money pre-flop that's it and he wasn't forced to by by posting a blind this can be a call this can be a race and so on so this obviously gives you a rough estimate of how many hands villain is playing. So you can see on the bottom already my VP IP with and I put that X there with exactly six players. This is very important is 24 or 24.3 or something like that on the latest sample I played actually just this month because people like this stat can still like deviate for regs quite a lot even though they are playing the same style so especially back from my zoom days for example lots of Russians I think lots of Russians had quite loose stats and they were quite tight. And I want to make that a question to you guys. Why might that be the case? Why are some players having looser stats than others, even though they play exactly the same style? And here I'm talking about Zoom 200 and Zoom 500. The way I wrote they tried... No, I know they played exactly this the same style the way i phrased it here stefan's bpip with exactly six players should give you a hint maybe a russian poker platform that teaches that nope nope all right i'll help you out um there were lots of times where zoom 500 was always full and these were the times i was mainly playing. The European afternoon, stuff like that. And Russian time zone is slightly different depending on obviously where you are in Russia. That they were playing on average way more four and five handed. Which was like the early morning or like the before noon. Where like lots of times where it was played four and five handed and then obviously you play more cutoff more button and not so much early position where you are tight so those those regs maybe played exactly the same style i played and my stats were 24 20 and their stats were like 27 21 just because they played more four or five handed and this is something why maybe lots of players who even like rack battle a lot, play three four handed, seem to have looser stats. So this is something that if we want to go deeper into the HUD that we need to filter out. So on the one hand we want to have max information, on the other hand we need the right information. So yeah, here we go, less players less than six players. This is why I put it down here, right? If I look up my stats from today, I probably would play like 27 because I had quite some four and five handed action. So it's something to understand. And now I said VPIP is mainly important for figuring out whether someone is just a bad player, right? Whether a rag plays 25 or 27 or 22 or super tight, or even as a recreational or just a knit who plays whether a rag plays 25 or 27 or 22 or super tight or even as a recreational or or just a nit who plays like vpip 18 well it doesn't matter that well i mean it matters but it's important to figure out the high vpip guys right so someone who plays like vpip 18 is obviously way too tight and and hopefully not a winning player but he's not losing much either right just like every hand that you are folding he's also folding which means 75 percent of the hands he's just playing perfectly and then there are players with a vpip 60 vpip 50 vpip 40 there are guys out there i'm not a specialist for that especially like those like mass data guys who ran some sims just like knowing or actually see see how much people lose given a certain vpip just that just a recreational vpip 60 well loses just way way way way more money than someone with vpip 40. so this is our first that we need to find if we have someone with vpip 60 on the table this is where you want to sit what is good vp i've been eight-handed zoom games i have no idea i think like i played 1916 i think something like that nine-handed maybe 1815 something like that but this is like a number from 2012 back in my head so i really don't know all right so really we are looking for the high vpi piece because every hand that is a fold is getting played just loses money and this is the money going to us hopefully all right second stat very very easy pfr just means pre-flop race this just gives you a rough estimate of how many hands villain is playing aggressively preflop. Not just playing, this takes out limping and this takes out all the over calls. So preflop race is very important. Someone with VP IP 18 can be still a tight okay rack playing 18 15. Someone playing 18 2 needs to be horrible. Still not losing that much because VP IP is too low But like just this over a hundred hands and I know he's absolutely horrible Right, and I still want to play him probably but I I want I want to sit on his right probably, okay Okay, so here now coming to another thing right so here fun player special I put down the bigger the gap between VP IP and PFR the more passive villain is. Often that transfers over to postflop tendencies. So we have no clue, no reads, no stats, no nothing about postflop yet but obviously the guy who's playing 18-15 is way more likely even though he's in it to bluff something postflop than the guy who's's playing 18-3 This is just a very very clear tendency that makes a lot of sense if people are just in this I call I call or I fold like they don't even know how to build a pot themselves and now coming to the question from before is This gap can tell you a lot about whether someone is playing 3-bet only or playing flatting ranges as well. So if someone, let's say, like me, is playing 24-20, has quite a low gap there, all the VP IP is coming from big blind flats, it's very close to 3-bet only. If someone plays like 27-18, well, he needs to have more flats than that, and they will come from other positions. so this is the stat I would look at that I would say like something like 300 hands is already quite reliable for something like that to know Okay, what will he do with pocket sevens button versus cutoff? What will he do with pocket eights pocket sixes? King-10 suited king queen offsuit, right? So those all those candidates if people have a high gap they are very likely calling those in this position if like not saying that anything is better like the mix is the like correct answer but you can simplify that obviously so the gap i'm talking about vp ip just vp ip minus pfr can you explain what 18 3 means vp ip pfr exactly right so far we talked about about VPIP and PFR and this is just when we talk about basic stats. Yeah, just saying a 35-24 player, 18-3 player that always is referring to VPIP and PFR. Actually every other stat I'm always mentioning which stat it is, but just this is so common that I don't even feel it when I'm talking about it. So you see here I wrote it down Stefan's PFR with exactly six players is 20 here. So I play quite a simplified three-bet only game if there is no recreational behind involved then I start flatting. I speak quite a lot then and this is the stats that will lead to. So how do you implement this on GG? Do you upload all the hands into PT4 or whole manager 3 after a session and analyze afterwards since GG only saves last last 50 ends and if so how do i get this information back into gg to use it on live games well on gg it's just tough right so i'm way more i mean i got like i grew up on poker stars and this is what i did throughout my career now gg i only play higher stakes because well gg is only thing for me the last three years probably and i don't have any stats so i write down tendencies i'm way more taking notes about certain hands so i i take it more like life poker i don't know anything about stats on on gg and yeah i write more notes just notes but yeah i mean since on high stakes I pretty much know every player I kind of know their stats and I this is something I looked up actually like same people and I look up whether I have stars stats on them I have like if I have 20k hands on Pokestars against someone well I know they play the same on the other side this is just the thing that that is easy because it's just a handful of players on those stakes. In between it's note-taking. The stats won't help you much. The stats will only help you to figure out the biggest recreationals. To play on GG poker and other platforms, do I need to use two different computers if I want to use a HUD on stars? I don't think i but i don't know i'm i'm not an official from from from someone else needs to help you with that maybe just drop them an email but i followed that on twitter a little and there was more like about about like hand to note like that gives you a little more info than just the pure stats i never used that myself so i'm'm a whole dimension 1 guy, whole dimension 2 guy and now okay I figured out how to use whole dimension 3 now but yeah so I don't know 100% but I'm pretty sure that you can use basic stats on other sides while running GG. My most volume is clearly on GG 91 tower actually I just played a little uh 1k gg the last couple of weeks and yeah was there yeah going a little for the leaderboard they are just playing nine tables and yes ours is pretty much dead i'm just only using that for videos there's no no games going and and are actually i'm not playing acr right now okay cool we have vpip weIP, we have PFR now, the third one, very easy 3-bet. Let's go quickly with that. 3-bet definition means raising it up with an open raise before someone raises, you decide to re-raise. That's what we call a 3-bet and it tells you how aggressive people are attacking open raises. So this is just again, we can shape their range and people are very very different when it comes to that. This helps you to figure out your calling and it helps you to figure out your forebetting as well. Again some people getting an ace king in earlier positions is absolutely horrible. Against some others it's absolutely standard because you have so much fold equity you make use of your blockers it's just. So, and this will help you a lot to know whether people like 3-bet 9% or like me 10.5% or maybe even 13% or they start with a range of 6%. So obviously playing aggressively against those people who play 3-bet only is way more interesting. Well because they have wider ranges ranges you can attack that more than if they have like queens plus or a bluff and they flat their jacks tens of nines right that sounds good so kind of confirms my thought yeah so if you are unsure and don't want to risk anything just just i think gg support is good just drop a quick question you will get the thumbs up very likely and then you're safe all right so this is something we talked about already right you asked the question here that that i wanted to to have here on the slide that the fun player special here the tighter villain the more money we win post flop with hits right just have that in mind we want to have hands that know on the flop whether they beat aces kings well it's mainly talking about set set mining and obviously maybe some four five five six suited uh sure any hand can make two pair but they flop like open enters and straight draws and we know how to continue all right so minus 10.5 if you wanna if you wanna compare that to yours or to different ones yeah nine or eight percent sounds quite aggressive on on zoom eight handed that sounds good auto trigger no so very important to be on the aggressive side there especially in like those those four ring zoom games i think okay let's get i think i've one or two i think only one example for the basic stats because it's so easy but yeah this is example number one you i don't want to didn't want to cut it out. You see the full HUD there I was using, but you only need to look at the three numbers that have colors. There's one more number with a color. I see that this is the number of hands, but on the left side, the 35, 31, 23.5, I wrote it down underneath again, just to make sure we talk about the same thing. And on the right side, the VPIP 38, 3,2.7. So now why I chose those two players is very easy because they have almost the same VPIP. They are both horrible and we want to play with both of them but we want to play against them absolutely completely opposite. So this is just something where... now forget all the other numbers around. All you need is those three numbers and you know how they play and you need way less hands than those 1500 or 1000 hands. So this is just something I want to show you how how powerful that can be. So we see first of all on the left side 35-31 we have he's playing like every hand but he's playing a very very low VP IP PFR gap right only 4% which means this guy's clearly playing 3-bet only. Obviously they fit together with a 23.5% 3-bet. Which, well, what you could do is like against him you can just like you can for sure profitably, not saying that this is the best option, but you can profitably 4-bet jam ace-queen offsuit in any position. It's like, yeah. Against the other guy,. Well You don't want to do anything So this is something that clearly will transfer over to post flop We talked about that pfr three bet will transfer over to post flop. Obviously this guy on the right Won't bluff a single hand like this is the guy who will check back his six high on the river I don't know but very certainly and on the left side this guy will probably bet too thinly because it's like the best hand he got dealt the last Last 20 hands and he can't take it anymore and he will just take any opportunity to rip it in Death for bet more trash and trap some good hands No, Chris. Yeah against this guy on the left. You definitely don't want to for bet more trash because he's not folding He's just ripping in every pocket So you want to be on the you want to tighten up actually a lot when open raising because you know The three bet is coming Twice as often as it should So we are not open raising King Jack offsuit under the gun. Like why should we I know we just we're pretty much never Never falling falling then All right, and obviously we can fast play all kinds of thin value and that's it How are you doing on 1k GG so far? I'm Slightly up. I played like two No, like I don't know I play every second day or so, so I'm up 10k right now But I don don't know rakeback and so on I don't have all the hands actually I played a lot today and yesterday So it's not big sample maybe 20k hands and I'm slightly winning before rakeback something like that Okay, so Christian I know I guess it depends then because some people also 3-bet a lot but then over fold to 4-bet, right? Exactly. We don't know the reaction. The stat is stat is only telling us what he is three betting and now we have different ways to exploit that is he folding to four bet bluffs well then four bet bluffs it is i i remember that guy this is why like he's definitely not folding right we i can read the other number this is the 38 there i don't know whether you see my mouse this is the fold to four bet the 38, which for those stats is incredibly incredibly low So yeah, but yeah, I remember that guy How do you feel about the games? Depends on the times as always I wasn't selecting at all and I play everyone heads up and so on so I was playing really shitty games But I got lots of presents also Regarding the GG 1k. All right, actually I'm talking a lot I like it lots of questions and i'm happy to answer that but i guess i had i thought i had way more time for that session and now it's less just like last 15 minutes and i i'm i'm moving on a little okay yeah homie looks at 7-7 is rocking it in that's it all right absolutely what's that come on let's now i i can't help myself i i want to show you stuff now now. On the second screen looking for that guy and maybe I find a funny hand, right? To just show you. Oh yeah, this was against me. Here we go. Let's have a look from both perspectives. All right, we do a little guess the hand. Quick round before talking about the advanced sets. So the guy we're talking about is Dom Professor here So sorry if you're watching But this was a lot of fun playing versus you because he I think got me good the beginning and then it got crazy and crazy And I adjusted quite well. So we're playing zoom 200 200 big blinds deep easy 3-bet from the big blind here 5x fine sizing he should go slightly smaller I think when we are deeper because he doesn't have good board coverage but wait he's 3-betting everything so he has incredible board coverage i go for the easy 4-bet and as you guys know me i'm obviously having it always and he calls all right so he calls a 4-bet here flop is king 8 deuce all clubs he checks i see bet small turn three he checks i i bet half pot and then i have half pot left it's like i mean okay whatever right we have it guys we have it he goes for the freaking rip and against lots of players i would not hate my life with my hand but uh like in general against other players i would play different sizing plan but um yeah but yeah tell us tell us uh tell me his hand tell me his hand eight nine suited not too bad not too bad eight nine suited would have some equity 6-5 suited it's a little worse than that a little worse than 6-5 regarding equity against my hand ace-5 with a club now that would be an easy jam for him easy jack-4 offsuit is very close jack-4 offsuit would be drawing dead against my hand 4-5 would be even better but he got two outs or is it one? I think only one out. He has the classic red pocket sixes and maybe as a last thing or is it here for that guy? Let's have a quick look. This is how you are a red line winner. I don't know what happened in the end. Starting to win blue line and losing red line. But yeah, he will get there. He will get there for sure. So yeah, this is what you can do to not lose red line. If you're interested in that. Okay, now let's continue with the plan here. Buttons were clicked. Cool as were dealt. Here we go. All right. I hope you enjoyed that. Main stats advanced. Don't take them for granted because now we are really talking about stats that where we need sample size. And so it's not just I did this because of that stat. Right? The VPIP PFR we can do lots of reasoning because this we can take that as given. Like his VPIP was like 35, 40. This is why I can easily just get it in one pip to wide or something like that. This is a good reasoning. Here it's a little tougher, right? So we want to combine those stats with maybe other stats. For example, VP, IP, PFR, and 3-bet. So here those stats is not for figuring out the recreationals mainly, but to make differences between the regs we are playing. i use those to characterize players a little more like and i know it's a good drag but i still call him a nit because he's maybe a little on the nitty side for a good drag right and then i can i can make differences between those right let's say i don't know i don't want to drop high stakes names here so some people are a little more crazy some people are a little more sticky and so on all right let's start with did the ace of clubs influence your decision my decision was always getting in 200 big blinds with any king here like we had history there before it can seem it was easy usually the ace of clubs is a reason to to yeah keep the sizing a little smaller against other players because I need way less protection, but yeah. Okay, so let's start with number one. My favorite stats that everyone is not using enough where it's possible to have a HUD like Zoom 200 is positional raise first in. RFI just means raise first in, so it's not just preflop raise, which includes just your raise, your 3-bets, your 4-bets, it's really your first in in a certain position and you're raising boom. It's just your range written down We had the example before on a live table where I said someone on the button is open raising 9-6 offsuit Well, then, you know at least this range is this wide if you see a positional RFI with a certain sample size Well, then he is open raising 60% on the button So here you see my stats, let's have a quick look at the bottom. 19 from under the gun, 23 in MP, 30 from the cutoff, 44 from button and actually 49 because this is where I do the most exploiting against nits and weaker players from the small blind. Or another option, but I think I didn't do that, is that I didn't filter out heads up but I think this is now this for position RFI maybe I didn't filter it out this is why it's so high on the small blind that makes a lot of sense because I don't need to filter it for the other positions but it doesn't have that thing if we play four handed there won't be any anything counted for under the gun for everything so right yeah, it shows first of all the positional awareness You see recreationals that just play 27% from every position But you treat them as like I don't know what But now knowing the position is like, okay You need to be way tighter against the button than you are usually you need to be way looser against the early position than usually But it makes so much sense when someone is playing poker for the first time. Well position is just something you need to understand and some people do not do that in the beginning. Just king-10 offsuit looks beautiful from any position in a way. So now this is the spot where I say you can play versus range not versus the position. Usually we say like hijack open raises and this tells us how loose he should be on average. But if we know he has 23% we can look up a range versus 23%. If we have the next player who was only open raising 18% from there, well maybe we should 3-bet a range or a call range that is maybe that we play against under the gun from another player that is also 18%. Okay, very easy, I'll rush through those, you know them, most of you anyways. And my favorite, favorite stat now, second one, $1 when seen flop. It just shows you how much people fight for pots. Well, or give up easily. You have very good wrecks that have a $1 when seen flop of like over 50 is really, really strong, all pots are heads up and if you win more than 50 of your pots well then you are really like taking more of the share that belongs to you if someone has like 43 he didn't bluff in any big pot like there are some we'll see it in a second so you see how much people are fighting for pot. Fighting does not mean bluffing necessarily. It means both bluffing and getting bluffed. If someone is fighting for every pot, it's tough to bluff him because he will bluff catch. It's like it's just one win more. If like he makes a bad catch and only wins like one out of five times, well still it one win more that will count into the one dollar win scene flop so the higher the number the more likely they are both bluff and call happy so it's very very often that the guys who are bluffing the most are also the biggest calling stations also tough this is maybe an exception here if someone plays 14 plays 14-11 and is the biggest knit of all times and always has it, well, he will always take it down postflop. It's like you call and set in mind your pocket threes because they always have aces and kings, well obviously six out of seven times they will just take it down on the flop. Well, then they have like an incredible number winning, but this is then something because of the preflop stats. So again the combination. $1.00 win scene flop and VPIP PFR are interconnected but the crazy ones, let's shout out to some South American players, we'll see in a second probably, if VPIP and PFR are high and $1.00 win scene flop this is where you probably don't want to overfold your zero ev catchers all right we'll get to one more stat and then one big example and this is the one dollar showdown percentage again you can combine that or should combine that with the one dollar win scene flop so if someone is not bluffing then he should very often win at showdown, right? So the lower $1 win scene flop the higher the one at showdown, but if someone is not bluff catching Also, the $1 at showdown should be higher. So both things that make the $1 win scene flop up, makes the $1 showdown go down. And this combination can tell you a lot. So the crazy guys, you can then see whether they were on run or not. You need some sample for that. If someone has $1 win-seed flop of 53 and he also won like 56% of showdowns, well, he was just on a heater. Like this is just impossible. If someone has on sample 52% winning, like maybe this crazy guy from before, but is only winning at showdown like 43%, well then he's just always full of shit. Very easy explanation. What is the thing regarding Manuel Saavedra? Like he's a good player, I played with him a bunch, but I'm not sure of his stats. I think he has like medium. Like in the middle of the pack. Like he's not a nit. He's not crazy. That's why I'm confused of that example. How many stats you mean? How many hands? I don't know. It's. I see the big picture overall. Whether it fits. And then I kind of use it or not. That's a bit tricky though, because if someone is giving up a lot, well, usually you can... Yeah, it fits. The more aggressive players have the higher number on the $1 win-seed flop and the lower number $1 showdown. This usually fits. My $1 showdown is 31. Okay, my $1... I mean, you're just always losing. Maybe this was just last session. Like this seems really really impossible, or you are just always always calling and you're never having it. Like this would be the biggest outlier I have seen. So you see mine is 51.8. I could definitely bluff catch more and you can see like a good estimate is that they should add up to and then you can play the style. It's just like if I fight a little little more I bluff a little more I will win less at showdown and the other way around so usually they both like add up to about 100 is it wrong to have a high one showdown at micro no it's great it's about getting the most out of that JT doing well I don't know all right now example number Number two. I have four very solid or even very very good wrecks here. So I only could go for the stars guys. I have some hands on. And here we see the raise first in positional, right? It starts with under the gun, hijack, cutoff, button, small blind. And here you see something like Like, AGL by, it says, i think from russia one of the guys i had in mind who actually had had looser stats back in in zoom times because he played a different time zone where it was lots of five and actually he's quite a nit right the 15 under the gun 16 mp and then starting to play somewhat normal but like not adjusting and like like having less than GTO from the small blinds is a little weird then sunny92 a very very good player and I think he is like yeah very nice stats a little too loose from everywhere which can be because of adjustments then we have betpotcory very very strong as well, where we can see one thing He's playing a mixed strategy from the small blind. Obviously, he's not only playing 36% of his hands, but he plays race and limp And Carlos is just a little crazy, right? He's just the typical I don't know whether he's from Spain or whatever. He's Carlos in my eyes and like whether he's it's Brazil or it's Argentina or Portugal or Spain, I don't care. He's a Vamo player and he goes for it so which two stats are at the end it's positional race first in every position all right so just to see here you can make differences between those players and let's say you should play the big blind against any of those players versus certain positions just differently right whether you play against AGL by or a Karlos, big blind versus under the gun, is a hell of a difference. It's a 50% difference, right? 22 RFI is 50% more than 15. Right, and now last example regarding Wendzine flop and WLSH is this year. I filtered in like a certain time frame I'm not giving away too much about those players because maybe they changed their game. Just the 1$ Winzine flop Actually, I want to include the 1$ Showdown as well, but maybe I forgot and yeah only people with more than 5,000 hands I found here and This is the numbers that exist. This is why 50.5 $1 wins in flop and 50 this seems incredibly strong and almost impossible or on very low stakes Pokorbrowski So here we got Jaktis for example, lots of players know him. He's just a but on the very nitty side I would say I'm not very I mean like I played 48.2 I'm in the middle of the pack here. I think AGL actually that 48 seems rather low Given the now we need to put that into the perspective right given his tight preflop stats The 48 seems kind of low like this Lauric 22 guys over 5,300 hands. He just never bluffs Heal with lots of eyes actually this I have it in mind. It's just like not bluffing like still I'm talking about a wreck obviously he has his bluffs right but like not a spot where you need to make crazy calls and then we have like very strong players like for example Welsh guts and big stealer sunny 92 like in the 49 50 region and then maybe some people who are a little overdoing it like but yeah maybe I have Manka rider I have him as as quite aggressive in mind But obviously still this 51-50-49 can just be sample size. But just this is kind of the lines we've seen This is all the players in that certain timeframe. I have 5k plus hands and Yeah Can you summarize what it means that $1 win scene flop is like 42% so $1 win scene flop Means you see a flop and you end up winning the money so it's like in heads up pots it should on average be kind of 50 right you're on sometimes on the bad end sometimes on the good end so it's like usually slightly higher or slightly lower than 50 and now because of three-way pots four-way pots that you win obviously a little less than heads up pots it should be on average lower than the the 50 right so it just means you win the pot after seeing a flop very easy and now lost paradise can you explain why one dollar at showdown and one dollar at when seen flop should add up to 100 well because the majority of all pots are about 100 are um are heads up sorry that's what i wanted to say are heads up and most showdowns are heads up so it's kind of a 50-50 thing all the time. And then it's like your aggression that makes you win more pots which means you're probably winning a little less at showdown when you play more aggressively or the other way around so it's like kind of adding up to 100. The more you play multi-way pots, for example if you're flatting I play high three bet only game. This is why it's very very true for me with a hundred If you play lots of flatting four way pots and so on all the numbers need to decrease because you share your chances to win with three four players Okay, poker broski you have those numbers over 300 sample, but most nl50 Well, you seem to be a big winning player then and you should just move up. Alright, so that was the last example to just like give you a little idea of what that number is about and here I can't even tell you what is a correct number. Like no GTO wizard can tell you. Maybe it can in a way, but it depends on sizings and so on. But you can always compare it to other players, right, to yourself and so on. so on right so i'm kind of happy to be in the middle of the pack i'm on average playing too many tables if i was playing less maybe i could be a little more aggressive in good spots so my 48.21 dollar win scene flop i would prefer to have 49.5 and i could work on that but whatever right and i can spot people that are maybe a little too crazy or not against the 43 the lauric guy this is enough to just not call single big bad at any point okay poker broski that explains it you're just freaking flying over it 9 bb per 100 like taking way way way more than your than the sheer of the pot that belongs to you. All right. Key takeaways. Here we are. Last slide. Feel free to ask last questions. I'm happy to go another five minutes. But now we started today that we figured out that stats and HUD can tell us a lot about a player's style or it helps us to identify weaker players quickly. So, but remember the pyramid of reads, right? Because it does not represent how they play against you it's a collection of stats against other people mainly other people right not against you this is not a given thing a thing they are not programmed robots playing like that they are hopefully thinking as well maybe they they have the last bluff you made against them still in mind so as long as you are are unknown, that's very cool to use. Once you have played them every day, you have some history, you need, yeah, you need to, obviously you can think about stats, but it's not the main thing anymore. It's for me mainly small sets just to identify weak players and to quantify them how weak they are. All right, so here use stats for adjustments never as sole reason to go for a heavy exploit, right? Just like prepare your ranges correctly like this playing versus a range not versus a position just knowing that you play big blind versus 20% big blind versus 15% or a big blind versus 40% is a big difference. And then as we've learned in the end of maybe a little how all those stats work together and you could add way way way more we didn't even talk about c-bet flop and then like check back ranges and so on right we can go deeper and deeper here but i want to keep it simple for beginners more or less some advanced part and then you can combine all those stats for an overall picture and very important is to actually do that because i think i was the master back then to pick out one stat that gives me a reason to do something crazy even if like eight other stats tell me to not do it but I find my reasoning and I could present it in a way when I tell hand histories that I sounded like a genius even though it was absolute dog shit I was doing that so really we need to have the full picture and then make a decision. If we search, this is something to keep in mind, if we search for reasons to fold in a spot we will find them. If we search for reasons to call we will also find them. Very rarely we find only hints into one direction. So we need to be open-minded in those situations and really really figure things out and not like like, I want to call him so badly. Is there any good reason to call? Well, you will block something or you will unblock something and you will find something and you find a stat where he looks aggressive or not and so on. So really put it all together. And then big recommendation, build your own hut. Don't take anything with lots of stats from somewhere. Only put the stats in your hut that you actually use maybe start with the six i presented today and then add like in game you will feel it ah it would be great to know that i have 500 hands on that guy if i knew his fall to four bad i could do something here right not knowing it sucks and something like that if you have those feelings in game you add one one stat then another then another then another and then you will have that that at some point I don't know how many numbers I had like 40 numbers maybe and it took me like one second to kind of realize all of them because it's kind of your brain is trained. In the beginning I think two numbers are very great to have. All right Paul wants rates so yeah thanks for the rate but we're at the the end here yeah i'll i'll take a minute and wait for for last questions but yeah thanks for for watching everyone i hope to see you around all the free members just make sure to or the first time watchers make sure to make that free account poker code if you are interested in more videos obviously i'm happy if you're joined i think we have a great promo running right now if you just wanna wanna follow the team even more I'm watching lots of Triton stream these days actually while grinding maybe that's not the perfect professional setup but still I'm enjoying it watching the boys so yeah do that as well and what's here are there any stats that you use more for MTTs and less for cash I'm not playing MTTs and I never really did online. So I know from the sit and go background that something like stats that depend on the stack size are very important because VPIP PFR is totally different when you play 100 big blinds, 300 or 20 big blinds. So maybe they are more but I'm not an expert so I can't really talk about that Here we go the went to showdown 31 One at showdown 41 one whence you flop you're fighting mr. Wayne pokers. You're you're just like you are Almost like a dumb professor guy you're fighting for every pot. This is incredibly loose if this works out You should have a flying red line given those stats So you are really really incredibly aggressive. If that works out in the game you're playing, that's great. It adds up to 100. You see that? That's not a coincidence, but you can easily change and just leave some bluffs away if it's not working. This depends absolutely on your game. It adds up to 100, so it is kind of a solid strategy. Probably you can call less because villains are not bluffing, you're just not winning often enough. Could you maybe just say something briefly about how wide we can open from button and small blind? I have kind of a 100% rule which means I'm never adjusting more than 100% but that means that for example from if it's the most crazy table now that's a bad example but from the button let's say my standard range is like 43% I'm happy to go up to 86 this is what I mean with 100% addition if like there are some spots where I can go any two from the small blind there are lots of spots where I can go any two very easily Very, very easy. But But this obviously is a direct outcome of the fold to steal what it is exactly. Against a 38-3 guy who's never 3-betting and not fighting for a single pot I'm open raising in the small blind 100% of hands. Very easy. I do a losing blue playing anonymous so working so far. Yeah, it's usually it's the best as the counter to the pool If you have a tight pool Then you go for it in your style of school But it's you have lots of those spots where you can go either way or not Like are you bluffing is it profitable or are you not bluffing? This is this is making difference whether it goes into the one dollar win scene flop or in the one at showdown Very very easy you can decide where it goes into so you could trade your number from 41 59 easily to 45 55 and one of them one of those styles has to be better in your pool or not i don't understand why it should add up to 100 ball because mainly two people fighting for a total 100 if both is higher well then you are running really really good or you are just outplaying the field but it's almost impossible i obviously slightly higher is is maybe possible for the best players in the weakest games but that's about it so do you have fomo when you'reiton streams? I guess not. But what would it take for you to fly out again? Less stress at home with a family and traveling and so on. So actually, I would have loved to go to Triton, Montenegro, because it was always my favorite spot. But yeah, we were just in Germany before and just came back here. And then just like, yeah, every travel is is is is kind of tough so yeah if they make it in vienna i will be playing yeah see you for the next one see you on the platform see you in discord thanks for attending and see you around
