### TOPIC: cash bad regulars
 Here we go. Oh my god, here's something about bad recs. So some weak recs, so winning players that aren't crushers. Yeah, I have like more people in mind that are grinding there a lot. I will give you a definition of bad rec, what I mean in a second. And it's definitely people multi-tabling, not necessarily winning big, like maybe rakeback grinders, just people you you find out there in the streets so wait what is bad regs but regs standing here for for regulars people who show up regularly and bad just like being a bad player but like yeah on like a pro level necessary but just like not not great even they know the basics dr ciggy definitely confirming r confirming that Ryan Stecker is a bad rec. All right, so one past four, let's get started. This is the schedule for today. We'll start with a question that is BoomKlapper already asked so you can take over for that. What are bad recs is obviously something we need to talk about when we focus on that topic. I'll repeat the three questions before I had the again behind since it's a public coaching and not everyone here is a poker code member I will repeat that over and over again because it's very very very important when we talk about a topic like that. I'll give you a bunch of common mistakes maybe for examples depending on the time we go a little deeper i have something in the back of my mind that's not in the presentation yet if we find time i'm happy to present that then i prepared three examples i guess for you guys switching over to how to exploit bad recs right we talk about they are doing then we talk about what we should be doing and then obviously leave you with some key takeaways that you have the right mindset to then go at the tables in your next session mark people as like bedrock rakeback grinder whatever you want to have and have some ideas what what your goal is against them is this in the context of live cash games i mean it's in the context of poker the examples are cash games it works the same in tournaments pretty sure even though tournaments we have way more elements like icm and so on where we have different mistakes i won't be talking about those the live cash is always especially interesting because it's it's the same game like like online just the variety of people you meet is even bigger it's not like online you typically have like four to five more or less solid players and like maybe some bad wrecks amongst them and one one fish and like in in live cash games it's more like two people who know what they are doing three bad people who are not horrible and then like everyone else is just like bad so very bad so it's it's actually live cash game is just an exaggeration of everything you find online. So definitely what we are talking about here should help you in live poker as well. All right, so let's go. Let's get to, it's not a definition, but just like some bullet points. What are bad regs, right? Bad regs in my eyes are really like they got the basics right and they are multi-tabling that's kind of a start for me if someone is sitting there one tabling i don't even call it a rack like is the rack one tabling on like nl 25 nl 50 whatever nl 10 whatever like your stakes are i highly doubt it i expect bad racks to have more or less solid ranges. They know what ranges are, they know about position, they have like something that makes sense like whether they open raise 14% from under the gun or 17% I don't care about right. So whether they open raise 35% or 45% or 55% from the button I don't care about but they have a range that somewhat makes sense so that's the point they have seen charts before then second bullet point they are not necessarily fundamentally solid right maybe they have their comfort zones like when they play a single race pot in position as aggressor stuff like that maybe they have trouble out of position maybe they have trouble with aggression maybe they are bad in three bad pots and so on you will find mistakes that's the main point that you find mistakes you find mistakes in everyone's game plan like even the best players will make mistakes but it gets tougher right more obvious mistakes and then what is kind of the peak of the iceberg of all that is when they are predictable so actually sometimes i can go as far say like we know their hand or their hand type their hand class right so in one of the examples i was just like i played a hand and i did some super bullshit exploit just because i mean knowing is a strong word but i was very very sure that i know what's going on in his hand just because of in that hand it was actually timing but yeah stuff like that they do predictable things that's pretty much it that's my definition of a bad rack i'm not stating that all those rakeback grinders were a little bit too tight all the time and a little bit too value heavy that's maybe one group i have in mind but it's not my definition of a bad rack so people who are there every day who have mistakes and who have predictable mistakes that they are not changing right so people who stay the same we can treat them as if they play tomorrow the same way they are playing today that's kind of of the main thing. All right. Give me some time always. I have the chat here far off on the second screen. No clue how to move it somewhere else. So I'll try to read that. Anything we need to consider when deciding how to exploit the different type of bad recs. Main thing is predictability and how to exploit them. Perfect thing to get to the next thing. Three questions. So this is something I follow all the time. No matter whether I played the highest stakes, I'm not playing those right now. I give that to people for their thought process in every single hand. I give it to people to think about what they should be studying. and that's just three easy questions the first one is what would be right so knowing what would be right is is first the absolute key that we know it it doesn't mean that we need to play like that it's just knowing how wide we should be on the button how wide we should be on the cutoff if everyone else is super solid what should our flop strategy look like here and so on and now this is the point that we are talking about Today because today is about exploitative poker What is villain doing wrong? First we need to know what is right to even point out what people are doing wrong It's like it doesn't make sense to just say he's doing something wrong if we don't know better ourselves so now we figured that out that we have people who are doing something wrong and they will keep doing that wrong because they they are fundamentally not solid they maybe don't even understand what they are doing wrong they have no clue that they are doing something wrong but it is wrong and we know it better because we are more studied at least in this spot So that's the big thing and question number three now we figured out that they did something wrong we need to know what is the right exploit that is sometimes very easy but it can also be tougher right so let's use an image for that right i always talk about are we fighting fire with fire right if someone is three betting too much what is your goal do you want to four bet more now fire with fire go crazy against the crazy people or fight fire with water and maybe just like stay a little tighter to start with and then you have a strong range and they three bet and just the money comes to you right both can be fine not saying that one is correct here but there are different nuances of like what is the right exploit in some spots it's easy in some spots it's a little tougher but this is the pattern i want you to follow that's what i did my whole career that's what every student of mine i forced them to follow that i'm repeating that a hundred times and so far i guess those guys did quite well so what else we got here um yeah anything we need to consider when deciding how to exploit right it's really that that you know what would be right start with that don't say they are check raising too often he is doing it too often that he does it bluff heavy it's a stupid example no one is doing that right He should have like that type of bluffs. He's definitely missing this hand category, which means he is too value heavy. This is now coming to the right exploit. I figured out what he's doing wrong. After mentioning what is right to then say, oh, that's why I'm just folding my middle-ish made hands that can't improve, right? One leads to the other and the result here would have been the overfold against a two value heavy check raising range just one example main thing is predictability that it stays like that that this we can transfer that over to other spots maybe even this guy is never bluffing maybe we can rephrase it and and take something that is true it's like it's It's incredibly unlikely that this guy is ever over bluffing. Maybe we can rephrase it and take something that is true. It's like it's incredibly unlikely that this guy is ever over bluffing. What does that note tell us? Well this is now we figured something out that villain is doing wrong and the right exploit is when we have a bluff catcher on the river we fold. Easy. That's a very easy exploit. One that is actually tough to do in-game, but logically a very easy exploit. All right. Let's say there is a Wreck with 20, 50 and 6. This is definitely a bad Wreck. He's definitely on the tighter side. How should we start exploiting him? Fold when there's big action. He has very strong ranges. Adjust your ranges to that. Fast play when you have something better. He won't have enough bluffs. This usually transfers over to post lob and Just steal the shit out of them You take all the small pots give him the big pots when he's interested in them or better don't let them get big It's actually tough to beat the rake because they are not losing much. You need to accept that every hand he is not playing He's not making a big mistake and the others will be good hands so that's not the person you want to have on the table. It's a great guy if you have like a whale on your right and this guy on your left that's the dream that you want to have. So he's just not participating. He is not stealing when you sit in the big blind. Boom you make money. He is not defending when you steal his big blind. He's obviously defending, but not often enough. It's always a small percentage of EV going your way every single hand. You will be winning. Is it red line? I'm not sure, actually. But yeah, he just gives up lots of pots. But once he enters the pot, he has a than what you what you're used to. I think we have a big variety of very good players beginners ambitious amateurs stuff like that so let's go to the next thing but keep the questions coming I love it so now let's get to everything like that stuff that we love right common mistakes of bad racks first overfolding every database analysis every everything that some people who are good with data did so far in the last 10 years showed in the end that on all stakes people are overfolding i'm not talking about moving people off hands right if we are playing low stakes people usually end up calling random pairs too often but the way they get there they play too many hands they end up with shit on the flop they fold they end up with shit on the turn they fold they chase a draw they fold the river so this leads just to certain frequencies which makes them overfold they are not bluffing themselves right they are checking back when they have nothing boom you bet the turn you win right just this is what i mean with overfolding it's not like he has a weak top pair let's put stacks in and i want to fold no it's happening over time in all the different spots right they bet small you raise they fold too. They are not re-raise bluffing. That's some frequency missing right there. Okay stuff like that. The other thing I mentioned that already poor bluffing frequencies very very often typical for the weak regs or bad regs right that they are not bluffing often enough themselves so what happens their bluffs that they should have end up in some kind of checking ranges which again makes them over fold one leads to the other so you can attack their checking ranges usually more and when they make action the fold is your friend now my very favorite thing inconsistent bet sizing we have that a couple of times in the last coachings also where i said i call it like sizing triggered by hand just like something your hand wants to do you have a value hand you want to go for max protection you have a draw you bet like a random sizing because you don't want to invest too much it's like just people telling you their hand with the sizing right on a double flush draw board most half pot bets are not really strong alright so just stuff like that that they tell you something about their hand that you can react to but it's not necessarily range it's often just a specific hand not realizing that people maybe there is a big big spot on the table and they are not open raising wider because of that or they are not realizing that you are super wide now and they don't give you any trouble stuff like that missing dynamics is very very typical for bad racks and one that i entered like last thing actually because it was just the example a hand I played I'll show you later. It's timing They look at their hand Probably playing a couple of tables Very likely too many that's like kind of a soon thing as well. It's like a tough decision They take time easy decision. They have more stuff popping up. They make a quick decision, right right so the snap call in a spot where it's tough to think about do i fast play strong hands or not it's very very likely that they have a non-strong hand like a mid pair a weak top pair flush draw stuff like that so just take that into account in certain spots i love the scroll up value tell something like that. Exactly. I typically see recs calling wet boards with weak hands. On low stake you get less folds, more gambling involved. I think you have more over folding the low stakes. It's actually that misconception that people are not bluffing enough and then they obviously fold when they have nothing. When they have something I would say they they call more often. So't like the take the easy ones check check bad river they fold they showed you they have nothing you need to win the air versus air so really see it that way don't try to move them off hands try to win when both of you have nothing that's the main idea we need to win the nothing versus nothing fight I nothing fight. Against very good players they kill you. The very bad players especially multi tablers and so on they have nothing so they need to throw away. Greed always works. I want you to be greedy. Actually the scroll up is beautiful for value. Less than 10 BB pots, especially in low stakes, are crazy overfold. Just double check if you have a whole dimension or use anything like that or whatever database. Check your delayed seabed success. Just think about that. How often it's check, check, flop. it's checked to you on the turn and double check any board what gto wizard or any program or ask someone who has access what the fold frequency should be there and then check with yours overall boards it's like you have a success of 65 to 70 people are mainly folding and it should be like not more than 45 maybe. It's insane. When I check raise the flop and get called and miss the turn do I keep barreling with a flush draw? Well, that's a spot where it depends a lot on the board. But in general as long as you have equity it can't be that bad. So in those spots I want to get more specific, that's a very very specific part of the game tree already. But you have equity and if you have fold equity also it can't be that bad. Then you want to maybe adjust to the right sizing depending on the spot, on whether the turn card improves your range and so on. So it's a little bit more tricky than that but you want to definitely give up the rubber on on a miss like very very very likely that's the important part what is optimal for most players six or less tables my mind starts to melt anything above this this is a very very personal thing it's an age thing it's something what what your background is are you used to do like lots of i mean my generation has lots of like multitasking kind of warcraft 3 like games where for me it was pretty easy to play lots of tables for others it's super tough like actually i played paddle tennis this morning with korai aldemir and our main event champ and i know he's like he can't could never do more like like four maybe like a big tournament session yes when things in the beginning are easy and then in the end you have less tables anyways but he he plays mixed games right now it's actually one tabling like he was not made for i mean i was a tabling zoom like hours which is just a very very personal thing everyone's different there delay cbet prince people don't protect their checking range yes yes absolutely how would you approach playing out of position sing raise pot versus rex that's cbet too much let's say button versus big one would you start check raising everything on flops that are bad for his range or float everything and start check raising bad turns for his range or float flops and bad rivers a mix of all of those you want to do to do more on boards that favor you i love lots of min check raises actually let's make an example right you defend board is seven six three and you know he's c betting 100 really imagine this guy is c betting 100 which means on seven six three he c bets jack 9 off suit, Jack 10 jack-9 offsuit, jack-10 offsuit, queen-10 offsuit, queen-jack offsuit, king-10 offsuit, king-jack offsuit and so on. So you really kill him with you take your 7, you take your 6, you put a mint check raise out there. Whether he calls or not it's your board. You have more of those pairs of those solid straight drawy hands. You kill him right. You can obviously also check call and then he's there with shit on the turn. If the turn card is a Jack-10 Queen, okay It's a little bad, but there are also bad turn cards, good turn cards for you where you could start dunking There will be lots of check check. People over c-betting the flop often need to check back the turn more, if not they are heavily over bluffing. So So check raising turn is the option if they bet turn too often if they bet turn not often then you can take it away on the river. So lots of options just the main point is starting they invest too much money with on the flop when it's your board you can start something. Do you think zoom rush is more profitable than normal tables? Absolutely not. You find more of the bad wrecks there that you can crush but still there's high rake, it's tough to beat that stuff for a good margin. You want to select good tables and then you have like one monster recreational maybe and two or three of the bad wrecks and that's perfect. You play the same people again so every read you make is worth way more would you go even more crazy and check raise jack 10 on seven high flops in that extreme example if you see betting no no it's fine i have a shit hand i'll let it go it's okay so all right cool examples let's see some examples i just came up with a couple i don't know whether they are good it's just that i actually played you see like three sessions four sessions this month i think mainly in a 100 some 200 like for fun i had like you see like here i had one hour 20 minutes nine minutes 12 minutes like actually it's probably i had the baby and she finally fell asleep for her small nap i did something here in the flat and then I had like 15 spare minutes and I went crazy with the red sometimes but still enough to find three hands for you and I want to share those with you because I think they fit this guy we have red hood six I don't know this guy, but somehow I have 3,400 hands on him. So he probably played a lot of like Zoom200 or something with quite loose stats. Hello, my friends. I think, I don't know, but I think he is from Brazil. So he is crazy and he's like four betting quite a bunch. He starts loose, 21 from early position we are deep on a 100 i3 bet standard he goes for a very large four bet which is correct that deep but i know he's playing a hell lot of tables and i highly doubt that he that he plays his entire range with that sizing just like you have aces you do whatever you do You don't think about it I can call I can fold but I call because I don't want to say put him on a certain hand But I say it's more likely that he has ace-king that this type of player is fast playing ace-king deep Some others start always flatting He goes for the bigger sizing which is good with all his range with that stack death But I'm saying it's more likely that he just has ace-king more often Thank you. He goes for the bigger sizing which is good with all his range with that stack death But I'm saying it's more likely that he just has ace-king more often all right, so We have notes from I don't know when but I don't care Just we find a note from ages ago. I don't know what that is big enough I read it out big blind versus small blind defense 8-6 offsuit. That's close Button versus big blind 4-bets king-jack offsuit. offsuit so he can bluff four bet that's a good interesting note small blind versus early position he three bets and then calls the four bet with pocket kings only i think this is a good adjustment against the pool blind versus blind he raises and calls a re-raise with king queen on jack nine four just chose solid aggression this is not interesting suffers fancy play syndrome okay interesting i call and what i do here is actually i check to a friend in whatsapp on the side because i was blinding out and like this brazilian guy i don't give a shit i put him on ace king and play it this way we get a queen high board and he checks i check back i could do something now bet small against his potential ace king i don't care whatever right so the seven again he's rapping kings queens aces pre-flop now checks queen deuce deuce it's weird checks again and i'm like i don't give a fuck i put him on ace king he's from brazil maybe he just calls it down who knows right i go for adjustment not for a small bet that makes sense i go for freaking half pot here and mr fancy. Fancy Play Syndrome. The node was there before I played this hand. Of course for the min check raise. And I'm just like, if you played kings or aces this way, hell congratulations. If you play really pocket queens this way and check min raise against the big size, this would be so stupid i don't think so so i call i still whatsapp open on the side this guy has ace king in the chat five of clubs i i'm not scared of any freaking flush draw no definitely not i hope for him to have freaking ace king with the club and that he rips it i'm freaking snap calling here i i can be wrong i don't know but not strong reads but just showing i have some notes and use those to back up my play because i know this guy plays a lot and he plays a little on the crazy side he checks and actually i would love to to just value bet for red line or put 15 dollars out there let him hang there with his freaking, obviously, ace-king. So it's tough, right? I can't tell you. I know this guy had ace-king because of this, that. But everything there. The bigger size, yes, maybe he plays perfectly. But why is he playing zoom 100 then? So maybe he's just having ace-king more often and sizes up because he wants to fold a little more very likely i remember i did that myself why is he checking queen deuce deuce a mint check race against a big side like nothing makes sense here and then i know that he is just like on the crazy side if he would choose to c-bet small flop and no actually i used the pre-flop read and had it in the chat i will call down if there is no king or ace so this hand was i was not folding but yeah i could have been absolutely wrong and then he plays a range that makes sense like zero percent i believe he has kings like that no freaking way he checks kings on that flop and then he goes for a mint check raise no no freaking way so he really has like the super trap or some bullshit and there are not many super traps all right but that's not the main example all right this year is actually the favorite example of the day mr jacob rabat we got 234 hands here this guy is a very typical i don't know whether he's bad maybe he also good No, he is I know now after he has to be bad 26 17 5.8 Falls 57% verse 3 bets whatever positional unawareness we see that in the RFI I think this is enough hands 24 from early position only 36 from the button That's weird. Just weird. he open raises i3 bet he calls check i go for a half pot c bet and he freaking snap snap calls no because i want to show that i see in the the that i have reads them, that it's kind of a bad drag. I obviously could do without huts, but for making the points I want to make, I think it's interesting that I categorize him in today's session. I'm not showing you hands against strong pros today. All right. He has pocket eights, he has pocket tens, he has sixes, jacks is my instant read or ace king or seven six suited or seven eight suited or nine eight suited or five six suited. Mr. Skradac, I'm 100% with you, right? This snap call is a hand that was not thinking about a race, not thinking about it's not like a jack ten suited type, something like that. Okay, check ace is a great card for me and Solver says I should mainly see bet but now I have a problem I don't know this guy and I'm a hundred percent with your read He either has something pocket eight seven eight suited seven six suited nine eight suited pocket Jack's pocket tense or ace King and ace King is quite a bunch of combinations. I think this type of passive stats we have seen i want to show them again is likely that he only call only calls ace king pre-flop so i was actually having that in mind so i decided against it because i was not sure do i go all the way and then like i don't want to double barrel now then give up and lose to tens and pocket eights and so on or go all the way and run into ace king. I wanted someone said it before in the chat against weaker players I want to collect information and here I get more information by checking. Ace queen off is a point also I think he would be very bad if he calls that versus half pot so he can have ace queen suited absolutely but probably not snap calling so i really give him something connected to the board i actually will be wrong in the end but yeah still showing what i'm doing here all right river we get our peer and our friend here goes for the next big snappity snap check what's your play chat just type in your play please He goes for the next big snappity snap check. What's your play chat? Just type in your play, please. He goes for the next snap check. Snap call flop, snap check river. The lucky German checked behind. You can look up your hand and tell yourself you played it perfectly. And I think most of us after the build up from myself now agree that this is probably not max cv so we got 10 bucks in the middle bet 10 in position five dollar bet just something that you can see in the solver never makes sense right going for that little extra value with the risk of opening the door back up but this guy doesn't't have range. I'm saying that. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm right. But this is part of the game, playing rock, paper, scissors. If I'm wrong, I'm losing. If I'm right, I'm winning. And I have strong reads to say I'm more right than not. So I think it's a very clear spot where I know exactly what he's doing. If I bet big, he folds. If I bet small, I don't know. And I don't care. We don't know anything. 200 hands, we don't know nothing about his check raise. But I'm 0% scared that he has a better hand. So actually I followed your advice guys. I put out You see even I scrolled not even like an odd amount. It's not 25% I went for a random bullshit amount nine bucks one 30% would be great if I want to bluff Mr. C Tom man, I don't think for a second that he has like lots of ace-x here snap checking the river. So if I bet 130% I think I get close to 100% false. This is how I play mid stakes, MTGs and crush. That's it. You have lots of bad... This is perfect comment. This is where the money comes from. Lots of bad players playing too many tables, especially at say Sunday at 9 p.m. or something. All right. He calls for a random bullshit check raise sizing. I mean, we obviously snap him off. We are not thinking about, I mean, you are the bad rag being bad inconsistent now. Yes, yes. It's right. It's right. I deviate because of a read I made. And okay, I was wrong. he was stupid enough to have pocket threes here so wrong in a way but but definitely pretty right in a way also taking down this nice 45 big blind pot 45 big blinds from his side so stuff like that and this is one of the key elements that like if you know their hand feel free if you have strong reads feel free to do whatever bullshit is best for your hand don't be scared in those moments be happy about getting the check raise in obviously it looks to be like ah what if he has it what if he has it this is the evaluation is how strong your reads are how strong your notes are how would we play if a song is on flop absolutely different scenario then those pierre Pierre plus gutshot type of hands do not exist Then there is no like pocket eights pocket sixes totally different scenario Just like this snap call on 975 rainbow That gives me the vibes of he has something like Pierre plus not thinking about it snap like clear hands that are snap calls What bluffs do you expect in game? I don't care i know i have a better hand whether he turns his pocket sixes in a bluff his five six is seven six i really don't care where's jay kaylee do we have a value race if our read is no ace x if you are really into the red line i mean there is no value when there's no chance he's calling us and there is still a small risk that our read is wrong and then we only lose so it's a negative free roll but I think it's very close to 100% good here given the exact situation in the hand and then we could we could fancy play for red line because red line is cool but usually we're playing for winnings and not for red line okay what would you do if you three bets the flop I flop? I fold. The exploit? The exploit is that I value bet a second pair on the river that is not a value bet. And I use a sizing that should never ever exist. So two exploits at the same time. This one here another one that is i do not recommend this one too much but it's also one that is just like knowing his hand i bet small on the flop i range bet you could use a big bet and checks also i arrange that board here just get the aggression going make use of them not check raising enough boards like that so i see that turn is an ace i go for half pot flush is better for him but ace is great for me so i decrease my size and keep frequency up this hand is also a good check anything is fine half pot and he calls so i'm not sure against half pot I'm just saying most people are definitely check raising flushes here. River is the potential one card straight and he leads two thirds pot. What is his hand? Two things now what is his hand and what is your play? So Skradat says he wraps a 10 definitely. Never flush some two pair straights or bullshit 10 with one spade. That's very specific 10x hand, 10x hand. So we all believe him right? Two pair or low set. I think maybe that's too much I have lots of 10x here. They don't have value. But yeah He wraps a 10 and I'm very sure this guy plays 23 19. he is really not thinking too much out of the box 600 hands totally enough he has a 10 and we have lots of ace king and ace jack and i don't know ace queen type of hands and they all check back the main thing is like zero freaking percent he's playing a flush like that not check raising versus my small sizing on the turn and now leading i have lots of 10x myself i will obviously bet them and then he can check raise his flush if he wants to so just i give him a zero percent being balanced with a flush here so there's the chance i believe him and i fold or i believe him a 10 but never a flush and i rip it in for maximum pressure and then i need enough folds right risking 93 to win 23 is a very bad risk reward this is why i said i can't tell you whether that is a good play i can only tell you that call with any hand that is not a 10 is a very bad play. I just, there's no way this guy has anything else but a 10. If he has the Jack-9 offsuit with the 9 of spades here, Chapeau, like really great play. He made me fold everything. Just like I thought even if he has the once-in-a-lifetime bluff, I even thought like game my five of spades is quite an okay candidate. He has something like king of spades, probably that's king of spades 10 that's the one that he calls when he's actually blocking my most likely bluffs but like people don't have it in them to to bluff like the king-jack they end up calling so yeah I don't whether that play is good. I'm obviously ripping this one. I just want to show you, we know his hand, like very certainly. Like there is no 100% in poker, but I give you 90%. I would bet on the over 90. And I bet under the 3% for a flush. And this is what I do. If he calls the 10 here good for him. Here I went to play the game and he did fold tanked a little fits perfectly to the 10 so good. Would you ever do this without the spade blocker? Here I was triggered by the spade blocker I have to admit but it shouldn't play a role. I'm saying because of the pattern only calling half pot maybe timing also then donking like no chance he has a flush so my spade is absolutely irrelevant. Right okay so and it's important that I can have flushes right it would be better if the if the king was in spades and the ace was not in spades. Then I have all the nut flushes, stuff like that. Like here, I'm actually, which flushes am I betting half pot on the turn? Queen X and 10X, some flushes, but it's not much. But obviously. Do you change your timing when shoving as bluff? No. I try to keep my timing a little bit proportional to the pot size I tank a little longer with every decision when the pot is big or I make it big and I act like randomized in a way through the tables act pretty fast when it's still a small pot yeah if he calls the 10 I'm wrong then he wins like I'm clearly over but I overbluffing. I made the decision to overbluff here. Some people are never bluffing here. So it's important to sometimes find a bluff. If we want to do it balanced, that's great. If we want to play the rock, paper, scissor game, high variance, then we can say he's folding his 10 and we always bluff. It's important that we know his hand, which makes us choose the right sizing. And the right sizing is the maximum here. Here I tried to fold his entire range yes but his range is just a 10 it's always the same hand. I'm not sure he is folding a 10 or not I'm just shoving a flush also because it's just the right play. Any flush. A beautiful play would be just to shove any 10 also for the free roll if our read is very certain with him not having flush and here as as i said i bet on the under three percent do you have a checking component on the turn and if so would you still go for go for the bluff on the river or would that kind of cap you from flushes if i check back the turn and he bets the river like that i'm just folding i don't try to represent bluff then and then he can have flushes himself it's just really the the smaller sizing i used on the turn that makes me so so so sure that he doesn't have a flush right bad drag right that's the point we are playing a bad racket like i just see those tightish stats here playing zoom 100 like i mean it's a little arrogant maybe but to just then say like on average it will be bad racks i hope you enjoyed those those were the three out of my last sessions that i think were like fitting pretty well don't do this versus fish exactly versus fish no but this is a wreck the last 10 times he has looked up an overbet jam He has seen the nuts and he would never do something like that as a bluff It's like people project their thoughts into your play So maybe I shouldn't do it too often with my account, right? lots of people on zoom 100 know my star's name and that's enough of a reason to just click the freaking call button because They might know I'm just playing for the video and I'm just playing a little here and not really seriously and then it's fun to look it up and they will find enough shit so that's like my personal risk on that side but yeah this works out right especially we're just talking about bad recs do you still play on stars or x or gg nowadays actually i have just not much time with the two kids uh and one of being a baby and actually have sports higher priority right now that I play for some videos and so on on stories mainly because it's the easiest to jump into the zoom pool and maybe if I find some time some selected GG tables but not on a regular basis all right let's go how to exploit bad recs so i gave you the three questions what is right we need to work on that off table we can't get better while playing on the tables the better we get at spotting mistakes we can only figure out mistakes if we know it better just think about it as like playing tennis right how can you tell someone he's playing bad when you have no clue how to play yourself, right? So it's tough. So we need to get good at that to then identify and best case categorize their mistakes. Do you have an idea, right? If someone is like categorized can be as stupid as never bluffing. It's like in any spot not bluffing or very shy and tight in big pots is great right if he maybe has some small bluffs in him but if it goes for stacks you it's it's not he gave up the most obvious bluff that's enough for that note or super crazy because you have seen something where just nothing makes sense that's a great note take those notes track tendencies right whether you have a hut that can help you or not on other sides is this this is most of the money you make is this this note box it's not the hands you play it's knowing stuff for the future to then make the right decisions and now applies like now obviously those were extreme examples But we're talking about bad recs today they make mistakes all over the place all the time we had the example with someone playing 1916 or something he's just like letting you keep your big blind too often he's just giving his big blind to you this is where the money comes from so you need to apply solid fundamental poker without unnecessary risks. If you're really sure, the more we know, the more we can go into the rock paper scissor game where we risk our lives to maybe own someone's soul. So there is absolutely no need to be crazy. And key concepts is absolutely this here what I just mentioned deviate massively massively if you know their hand it's a very very strong word if you're very very very sure then you can go mask if you're a little sure you can go a little little this is what i mean with the second bullet point here adjust your frequencies by using indifferent hands lots of hands don't care what they are doing standard example blind versus blind villain is the small blind he open raises you call and he checks the flop then there are lots of hands which don't care whether they should bet or not like it doesn't matter if someone is over folding just go for the bet go for the bet more often if he's not bluffing later you won't win anything even with your strong valiance you just bet take down the pot that's easy right whenever the clear checks you should still check you have like no reason to do anything else and then it's about value value value so this king jack example i consider as like big big big value town right i don't put out a big value bet i put out the small value bet whether he calls the extra nine bucks or he puts out a check raise where i easily know i will snap him off i have a clear clear clear decision based on my reads and the other thing sticking to value also is what everyone does because it works size up versus sorry size up when you have it and they will call and get static ranges static call down ranges i want to say this year i mean something else size up versus capped ranges lots of people make the mistakes before they do something wrong and then it's over but you need to have the right exploit i'll talk about that in a second let me just check the chat hi ste you offer coaching? Mainly no time. I've like some VIP coaching. So let's be honest. I offer coaching if you offer me a lot of money for my time. So yeah. Can you watch this back? Absolutely. I love the spots when you know they got ace king and think how to exploit this. Yes, that's great. If we really know. But knowing is a strong word okay now no paint games today but i still open paint to explain two things i have in my mind two different types of exploits or two types of mistakes people are doing and the one is number one typical mistakes that are lying in future action all right so we make something and then villain has a decision in the future right this can be we steal button because big blind over folds is that true is it not true stats tell so i don't know so we make a decision we open race lighter because this is our expectation and now it's big blind's turn he can decide will he over fold will he not over fold i don't know he can react another mistake another example we Love jam River ass triple barrel, right? Villain can call or he can fold we make something he Can make the right thing or not, right? This is something where it's the typical rock-paper-scissor game it's like if we think he overfalls we over bluff if he really does we make all the money if he actually calls because we are crazy he makes all the money it's like rock paper scissor someone wins and we do not really know it's like whose read is better what does this guy know about us does he care is our read on point and so on because he can react he's he has the last word we need him to make that mistake after we did something typical mistake where decision point or villain's decision point is in the past. So does someone have an example for that? That's a tougher one. I'll give you a minute. Any ideas for a spot where the decision point is in the past and villain has no chance to react now? Make a cap range by checking one or two or three times. He didn't check strong part of range to protect. Here you go. When he is all in, okay, then he did something and we need to guess what he did. That's kind of the first spot, just out of villain's perspective. Unprotected check back range, right? Let's take the example I gave. That's the checking range, not check back now. Small blind opens. Big blind hero calls villains checking range is only mid pairs let's be really stupid right this guy checks to us on jack 10-4 a board he could range bet but when he checks he has either a 10 or pocket 9. could be be, let's just like, I don't want to say he has nothing, right, that nothing doesn't exist, so I'm very like on point here to make the point. Then I say like when he checks he has a 10. Boom. What can we do? What is the right exploit? Well, we can take like really, exploits always great to talk in extremes. So here if he really oh if that is true that he always has a 10 then we can take everything better and obviously our bluffs also and Just build a range 3e directional in overbet It's actually something the solver does But here this against the solver the small blind would be the small blind solver is protected with checking top sets some mid sets and so on Enough people out there are not doing that Thank you. But here this against the solver the small blind would be the small blind solver is protected with checking top sets some mid sets and so on Enough people out there are not doing that Even better when they snap check, right? Someone looks at jack ten for a snap check What the fuck is that? He has a ten or his pocket nines pocket eights. It's just so true I love it. Take your jack nine bet 150 percent pot in their face They call the first one even though they are indifferent and then they fold later take your queen five suited boom let's go you know you will be all in and they will be folding either turn or river if they don't turn two pair beautiful all right so another thing button verse big blind check back let's say mono board Check back monoboard and never have a flush. What is the exploit use way bigger sizes for probing than solver suggests and that's the right exploit they sit there now they can call the overbet they know you're bluffing or you're value betting like you don't care You can do that with a balanced range also. It's just you invest way more money that lets you win the pot way more often And the mistake is in the past they can't correct it They learn three bets big blind versus button with absolute polarized range. You can click for bet and And he is missing hands to react. He has no hands that can call. If he has something like, let's say really extreme, reasonable 3-bet range, has hands that then are called versus the one sizing and folds versus the other. So just getting the point where actually nothing can happen anymore, the mistake has already already happened and This is what I love the most because it's like Yeah Maybe they can do that next time when the spot comes up. Let's take some time. This is lower risk I would say and this year is let's call it. This is the rock-paper-scissor game. Either villain wins or you win. One will win. But who knows? Probably both sides think that they win. Okay, so queen 7, jack 7, 10. Yeah, Muggy, this is just super, super, super specific. I don't know what to make out of that. So you should not see that often on 7-7 exports. Or take that into account when the turn is a seven and he makes lots of two pairs more than he should or you can just say like he's defending a little bit too wide never folds over pairs no matter the board run out beautiful we make like three bad pots let's take that for three bad pots we can chase everything because we have way more implies capping themselves in early streets so you can size up for value in later streets for strong but not not a tense um if they are good players they should be kept whatever you do right to split their ranges correctly um but obviously this is happening right but i want you when you spot mistakes talk about them they do something wrong right they right? They really what would be right? What is Willem doing wrong that you say like They fast play everything against small sizes and then are capped This would be something that's their mistake They are never slow playing versus small size and then you can hammer on them if the river doesn't give them new nuts Over probes turns for small size and three red red pots when they're in position yet perfect I sometimes open fold my big line when small and just calls protect much okay nice all right so one hour in the books I hope that it was something I is a little more advanced I hope that came across okay and now to the key takeaways before I go back to the all all crying there in the living room key takeaways so now I showed you fancy things and fancy ideas but really the starting point is play solid avoid unnecessary fancy moves take the bluffs that are good take the belt take the thin value bets that are good play good solid poker and focus on knowledge right without knowledge we cannot explain then it's guessing game guessing game you can win or you can lose but it's more variance more random than anything it's a good reason right if the reason is this guy plays 14 12 with three percent three bet i'm very certain he has a strong hand when he 3-bets me. That's a very good reason to do whatever, right? So knowledge is key. Write down your notes. If something is off the books, write it down. This makes you money in the future. Extract max value when they make the mistakes. Focus on the value hands, not the crazy bluff like my ace-5. I don't know whether that was a good move. He folded this time, so I don't know whether that was good or not. But the King-Jack value, once I see pocket threes, I know a hundred percent that that was good. And that kill them, it's a strong word, I hope you get it right, when they are face up. Very very often people are face up really that they check snap check to you on jack 10 4 sorry they have pocket nines or freaking 10 8 it's just just write it down when you spot that and you see a showdown you will be right so often right and if not then take some time watch my youtube videos because actually in those live plays i'm sometimes very very surprised that i that i have quite a good rate of just guessing their hand correctly and this is not because i'm lucky or they cut the youtube videos so nicely to make me look good actually i think they show lots of lots of losses but it's just that people are very face up and this is what we want to make use of especially when they're bad regs Alright, I'll stay here for two minutes to see some last questions in but I think this wraps up the session I hope you enjoyed that one Especially everyone who's not a poker code member yet It would be great to see you sign up with a free account Obviously see you with a real account also to have you in the next coaching Feel free to reach out in discord make some suggestions what you are into if not as always i'll come up with something interesting and yeah thanks for watching and see you the next time guys baki 61x actually very good thing i focus more notes but that was actually when i started playing higher stakes and i knew most opponents so for you a good labeling system is very important it's one that you make up so what i did during zoom was just i labeled after vpip pfr to just have the first is he on the looser side if i'm on the turn important big pot against someone i'm opening up the nodes anyways right so for me it was pink was actually the aggressive vpip more than 26 27 in those six max zoom games Yellow was like those below 24 those standard regs and then I had the brown The the shitty brown for the knits to just have like the first eye catcher when I make my pre flop decisions This is what I use the colors for for the the other stuff. I use the notes Yeah, just but you thinking about it is already way better than everyone else write it down what you want to achieve with colors with notes and so on and then you go from there okay so yeah see you soon guys talk to you in discord and until the next one bye
