### TOPIC: cash boost ev with thin value bet
 Actually, I came up with the topic after like, I had it in mind for some reason. I came up with the topic last month. So it's lots of things, lots of examples I could come up with theoretically. So I prepared a bit, but actually I need to rely a little bit on you and a little bit on the luck to find the right spots when we enter GTO Wizard a little to check out things. And yeah, I'll mainly show you two things, how we want to adjust there, how we want to do that. We'll talk about position. We obviously talk about potential exploits. And then actually we play a little fun game. I didn't just randomly come up with examples. I got forced in the end. But actually, I can tell you already the typical spots, examples, I asked my good friend JetGPT for the best spots to apply thin value bets, I got an answer. And we want to check those out. So yeah, I asked for his top three. Those three were actually just two spots. And he gave like one of them twice. So I killed one and added one of my favorite spots. So that should do to get some examples going also. What is on here? Okay, cool. Let's talk about it right away. We're at the spot. Usually, that's the easiest slide. Usually, there's like one freaking sentence or even just a bullet point and that's it so today it's a little tougher because it's a combination of things right when are we talking about thin value bets so first of all what needs to happen is that we have a freaking mate hand and then we can think about a value bet and to think about a thin value bet we need the feeling that it is close or the knowledge that the solver says it's close or some other kind of knowledge that we think it's close and we think about how do we go for it or not. So just for explanation, a standard value bet for the beginners out there, a value bet is really the one where you hope to get called. Villain calls with many worse hands. That's like a strong value bet i'd like to describe it with feeling that you sit there and you hope to get called right the thin value bet if i want to describe that with a feeling it's more like i hope he goes into the tank first thinks thinks about it, and then finds a call. Right? It's like I'm beat by some hands, definitely, by quite a lot of hands. If he snap calls it off, I'm probably beat. But if he thinks about it and then really thinks about the bluff catchy part, this is where the money for the thin value bet comes from. So I need those three seconds time bank or like three seconds of brain power of villain's side that it's probably a thin value bet comes from. So I need those three seconds time bank or like three seconds of brainpower of villain's side that it's probably a thin value bet. So here, this definition description, only a certain part of villain's range falls and disperse. So we have a bigger range, he has a full range, one part he folds, another part that he calls and out of this calling hands, only one part we are beating. And that is not the biggest of all parts. So how big that is or should be, we'll talk a little bit about that later. I won't hurt you with numbers and come up with math equations that we could throw around with that, but I don't care. So we do that more on like a qualitative level that I talk about. Okay. It's like, should it be like, do we need 50%? Do percent do we need more do we need less what are the reasons for this or that so we do better the more we understand about ranges and hand reading obviously all right if we can put villain on like a certain hand class on a certain hand category we can come up with way more effective thin value bets than just randomly seeing we have a weak top pair or a second pair or whatever might qualify for a thin value bet so now chat is open again we got a couple more welcome everybody uh yeah that's the spot we're talking about today and yeah let's go first of all i'm more talking about ranges right so i'm not just talking about it's a hand, do we value bet or not? Because in most instances, there is not the correct answer. There's not an answer I could give you. If you give me a hand with a hand that is close for a thin value bet, sometimes I will tell you, sure, go for it. But value bets, we are talking about later streets. On a flop, I don't like too much talking about value bets because sometimes, yes, we are strong. Sometimes we are weaker. Yes, if we have nothing, it's probably bluff, but it's still a game of equities. If we have a value bet, does it mean we have like 60% equity against this range, against this calling range? Does it just mean we have a peer? What does it mean? We don't know, right? So this feeling of, do we try to get called? Do we try to get the fold that evolves where it's clear who's better, where it's more about made hands and draws get weaker with every card we see that obviously doesn't hit the draw. It gets more clear like that. So we are talking about rivers here mainly right so and then the decision is way more with our range right where is our value threshold what's the weakest hand we are value betting and this is the one thing and the other thing is which sizings are we using so there are two ways ways to exploit because for me thin value can mean a couple of things. It can mean we have a hand and we are betting and we hope to get called with something that is just worse but it's not enough to just talk about the betting. A bet size is also very interesting. We could have an actual strong hand that is a clear, normal sized value bet. You see, I put in a bet size here. I just call it like normal size value bet. Let it be like two thirds, three quarters, half pot, pot, whatever. It could be a thin value. If he tried to sneak out maximum value, let's say like one and a half times pot, two times pot, because the sizing just means how much Will needs to defend. And the less he needs to defend, well, the thinner our value hand can be, or at some point, it's too thin. And we either need to go for a smaller size or not bad at all. So we have two things we can work with. This is very important to understand that we have those two options. Because sometimes you rather want to increase your frequency and in other moments you rather want to increase your sizing. So I have one personal preference here that I think is kind of universal or should be and I want to have that here with a question to you guys let's talk about position we'll talk about that a little more later but in which like in position and out of position where do I like to increase my frequencies that I'm betting with? And where do I like to increase or decrease the sizings I want to use? So we have two parameters we can work with. And I'm saying out of position, I'm mainly using one parameter. In position, can you guess which one is which one? I increase the product of frequency times size. Yeah, that's what we can see. That's what we do. Absolutely. Yeah, I focus on one of them depending on the position. So let me check. Doveri comes up with out of position frequency and in position sizing. In position frequency, out of position sizing. Nevada Kalyok the other way around. H and K decrease in position size. I don't understand that. Student out of position increase frequency in position the size. Okay, so beautiful. Not everyone has the same opinion or the same guess. I don't know whether it is an opinion yet, but we'll get to that a little later. i just wanted to test test the waters first all right cool so we learned the first thing we have two things i hope that it's clear for everybody that increasing the sizing also is a way of value betting thinly i hope that is clear that is very important to me i go for out of position frequency and position size all right so, so position. Next thing. I thought there's one slide in between. So now, in position, our optional check. We have the option to check or to bet. And our check closes the betting round, which is worth quite a lot, right? We know if we do this, that happens next. It's not up to villain again. That means our value threshold is higher. We'll talk about that in a second. Out of position, it is villains turn anyways. We should squeeze out every penny of value we have without downside. So if you understand what I'm writing down there, it's pretty clear what my preference is regarding the question before. Out of position, I want to increase the frequency by usually playing a variety of sizings. And small sizings are okay. In position, small sizings are not okay. Small sizing means weak hands. And the value of getting a small value bet in position gets kind of counterfeited by the fact that once I bet that it's villain's turn again. So, I think this is not that clear if you're not deep into poker already. So let's say we have villain's range, right? And let's say we have a hand that tests like a certain strength and let's say our hand is somewhere here. Somewhere here, okay. It's somewhere here and we would say okay we're definitely far ahead of villain's range but are we also ahead of like his calling range i'm not sure so now we could do the following we could check back and we are freaking guaranteed to realize our equity right so we could check and we could realize equity and if I do that kind of correctly here, let's say it's like we're winning two-thirds of the time. Two-thirds win, one-thirds loss, which means win 66.66% of the pot. So now we could, on the other hand, we could would try and bet to sneak out more value, right? Let's say we go for a tiny bet. Villain needs to almost defend his entire range. We could bet, which I usually represent bets like this by a rectangle that we force Villain to defend his range. Like this here would be he defends everything, this bet size doesn't exist. Or we bet big big big big bigger bigger bigger bigger like pot size he needs to defend half of his range or like even bigger. So let's say we go for like I don't know half pot bet or like something small that he needs to defend quite a bit of his range right so like this he needs to defend this and as you can see if this is our strength still like i tried to hit the same point like we beat the majority of the calling range then we play against this entire continuing range right and since he should have a raising range also, like let's say this is his value range, that allows him to add quite some bluffs also. So boom, boom, boom, which is let's say this amount here, should be a rectangle at some point that we end up losing against right he check raises and if we have a thin value bet and williams plays correctly we are not having a call or it's a zero ev call which is the same like a fold then so actually we start losing to those hands that if we check back we would have won instead this is is the big big big downside of betting and the big reason why if close in position we don't want to go for the thin value bet. Out of position this scenario doesn't exist. Whether we check and it is villain's turn or we bet small and it's villain's turn to raise or do whatever it's kind of game theoretically it's the same thing it's villain's turn it's not like we're not guaranteed anything with our check we're guaranteed to let give villain another decision so this is something we absolutely need to understand now it's always a little we need to think it through until it's very very clear it's for everyone everyone at a certain point in the poker career to understand that. There's one workaround. Anyone who can guess. When can we also value bet thinly in position? There's one workaround against all the math here. When we have the nuts, well then we're not going for a thin value bet. If you assume you won't get bluffed off your hands, if people are not bluffing, they are not putting this here in their check raising range, yes that's exploitative reason, absolutely, then we can value bet more thinly. This is often something you hear, but yeah if he raises I know I'm beat. If that is true, that's a great reason to value bet a little more thinly. When out of position is totally capped, absolutely. If you know this is another reasoning, this year, boom, doesn't exist. Therefore, this doesn't exist either. Then we'll get to that in the end. Actually, there is another beautiful thing happening. If a loan can never have another 10, like just saying he does not have a check raise frequency, or one that is imbalanced and then we can call because we always have a beat, it's kind of the same thing, would even add value, so would be a very strong argument for betting. There's one more, without exploitative reasons. The answer I'm looking for so far does not exist. So you get to the right thing that we need in theory to happen, but you make it up with a player tendency. We can do it in a way that villain... We don't care which villain type we're having. When catching range is super blocked, okay? So influencing something with blockers again to influence that. No, I mean we we over bet big on the turn we are the only one hitting the straight on the river okay still then we should always bet very very big on the river with this kind of range and our other part that maybe wants to bet thinner could all like villain should also find value raises against that because he knows our river straight should use the maximum size. So whenever villain is capped with the reason that Jerome is saying against smaller sizes, they are still value bets existing, or value raises existing. Here we go, Chevy with the right answer. It was tough to move around that now with that. When we are all in, we can be freaking thin for value. Also in position. Then our value bet is a good value bet if we beat 50% of his calling range. Very, very clearly that it's better than our check back. There is no chance that villain beats us with a hand that we would have won against if we checked back. This is something we really need to learn. Like if there's a let's call it dice principle, we have a freaking four. With stack left, villain can take his freaking three bluff catcher. Instead of calling, he can check raise the shit out of us with the reasonable frequency that fits to his value hands then we have an indifferent call and he ends up winning with a hand that we actually have beat. This is our big downside. If we are all in he can only call or fold and in both cases we are winning against this type of hand. Okay so very important to understand that. When we are all in, we can go thinner than that. We don't allow villain, we don't give villain the option. Now this is very important in position and out of position that gets even more dramatic because we take away villain's option. In position, we could check back and villain doesn't have an option. If we are out of position, we actually need less than 50% to make the bet better than a check. We're somehow often hoping for the fold, but taking away villain's option is better, right? Just imagine you have a thin value bet and you could check, but then again, a villain again a villain will build a value betting range and add bluffs. If we jam ourselves and it's very close, we might slightly lose on the side of like if he calls we only are ahead like 45% of the time, but we kill his option to bluff us off our hand. So again out of position, jamming and sometimes being good, sometimes in the sense of like 45%, depending on sizings and so on, can be very, very beautiful. So Simon, very good question. How do we consider to whether call his check raise or fold it with our thin value hand? We don't know. He builds a new range. If it is balanced, we don't know. Our call is 0 EV. If it is not balanced, there is a moment to... there's something we can exploit. Player tendency, we are playing rock, paper, scissors, and we need to be on the good end. But we cannot know. I mean, I can't hold it back. Like we obviously look whether they are from Brazil or not. But yeah, it's a totally new scenario once it happens. But we should, in the moment of deciding whether we go for a thin value bet or not, we should, that should never be our like first instinct. Let it happen, then we make a decision. And if we don't know, that's also something. Like then we can randomize or can decide. Or I don't know. Everything is fine. It should be about zero EV. And if it's not, we try to catch on that read. If we have no clue, we should more or less call minimum defense frequency. Yes, that's what I mean. Like having randomized in like a GTO sense. Absolutely. Maybe use blockers slightly. Maybe some hands are better. Maybe some hands are slightly worse. More or less. Like the lower the stakes are, the more you want to slightly overfold. I think this is where the real equilibrium lies because some people are not bluffing at all and some people are balanced. So the real, like not many people are crazily over bluffing. So the real equilibrium should be somewhere in between as long as we don't know. But yeah. Okay. I hope that makes sense. Right. So let's now read through the slide again. In position now with all that knowledge in position our optional check closes the betting round or our all in bet actually closes the betting betting round or takes away villains' options. Let's stick to that. The check closes the betting round, so our value threshold is higher. When we can close the betting round with our all-in also, we don't care about that problem anymore. Out of position, it is the turn anyways, and we should try to squeeze out everything and we can mix our sizes we obviously should be somewhat balanced and small sizing doesn't necessarily mean weak it's the majority of weekends but still we can increase like put in some nutter tents that try to bet small and then re-raise so stuff like that okay but out of position check makes more money sometimes than betting also right yeah we're not talking about we need to bet it's just the definition of a thin value bet right thin value bet meaning getting more value out of fans that wouldn't invest money themselves in that sense obviously sometimes out of position taking as a bluff catcher because villain bets more off his hands than he's calling. Obviously, that's a totally new scenario. Letting him bet, yes, yes. I'm not saying we want to bet everything. Just like if there is value, we are more inclined to try and take it. And in position, we would always go for the check back. Okay, so now let's play that little game and get into the examples. So river after passive action which is actually fine right there's a check check there's like something like that going on so people are somewhat capped and this is a beautiful reason to go for thin value bets. Here I'll interpret that as like the out of position float, right? We check all the flop bet, turn goes check check and then now it's on us like being the big blind defender and then thinking about the river bet. It's a beautiful spot out of position to use multiple sizings. Very beautiful. All right the second one was pot control line with top pair mid kicker. It's like kind of the same spot just from in position, right? We see that we have like a weak top here. It's not good enough for three streets. We check the turn back. River is a brick. Villain checks to us again and now it's like we have a clear value bet. I mean it's clear it's not a thin value bet but maybe we could make it a thin value bet by being greedy and put out a big bet size there. And then there was like even like more shit coming. River out of... this is one that I added in then to have three. River out of position after barreling and board change. We're like yes we are behind quite a lot now but we were ahead before and we are still ahead of like a bunch of hands. And this is exactly the value we want to squeeze out. And I prepared some examples for all of those. Where is it? Not soon. Let's open a new one. GTO Wizard. Okay. So, first example, we actually look at two sides This spot number one and spot number two at the same time. And let's say I hope cash this looks good. Alright, so we go for a button race big blind defense. The flop is a freaking king five four, king five four rainbow. Check button goes for a third pot c-bet, quite common. Big blind goes for the call. Turn is a deuce. Lost draw or not, we don't care. It's a check, not a good card for in position player. He polarizes, uses big sizes, but this time he checks back. So we already see like his number two on the list from chat gpt like the pot control king 10 king 9 medium weak top here that's something we we plan to value bet the river let it be thin or not right so check check and the river now is something that gives, especially in position, new value hands. Maybe there are some thin value bets now. A 10. Let's get a 10. Let's get a 10 of spades out here. All right, so now spot number one was river after passive action. We've had our passive action on the turn and now it's on the player out of position. We see a variety of sizings. We see a 27% sizing, we see a 60% like normal size value bet 10% of the time. The biggest bet size now which actually the main bet size is an over bet here. Hello! 130%. So we already see that out of position where I said like I tried to increase frequency a bit, instead of like just using sizing, means we start using those small sizings also. And here it's not that much actually. It's like a bit pocket nines. It's, what is it actually? Like the few rivered weak 10x we're having, 10 is just very strong right if this is a different card we would start with like six to sevens and so on so here it's not that much because the 10 is actually pretty good for for in position but who cares right we split everything up and we look at our hands like pocket 9s yes we don't be the 10 we don beat the slow plate king in position. Very likely this would be a check back in our range and yeah we try to sneak exactly the value out that we have here. Obviously sometimes a check is still better if we look at something like king 10 is the highest frequency check raising hand here. Pocket fives, if we slow played before, we go with a five X lookalike and are trying to go for the check raise again. Ace three goes for the ace X lookalike, we're checking all ace X, so this goes also for the check raise. There will also be bluffs, right? Six three instead goes with a six X lookalike, which is full shit and goes for the bet so this is our pattern but first thing that we want to understand is like we sit here with like pocket nines jack 10 something like that and we know out of position any size is allowed if we want we can bet this size all right so this is important that for me that you take that away today, right? We bet this and you see Willem's option. Yes, he needs to fold now. Yes, he can call cheaply and yes, he can build a raising range. But against a small size, it's pretty much the same thing as if it's like check and then he has the option to bet any size or check back. It's just we take away his check back option, and we want that price here. We want this extra money, right? So let's see. 6.6 plus that, that's like 19%, plus that is like 22%, 23% total betting frequency. If we are checking, it will be a bit more it's a 43 so actually we get away but like some of the checkbacks here are give ups that are just folds in a way because not every hand is bluffing like a 9 8 we could can take that out of the equation so actually betting frequency is not that much higher as it seems. But okay, so spot number one, I hope this is clear. I actually came up with this one for what we see in a second. I don't mind trying to sneak out value. It's only a certain offer here of bet sizes 27, 60, 132. We can bet smaller also, right? If we have less value, but we think like we sit here with sixes and we know Villa has lots of 5x and 4x and he would check those back. Why not put out the min bet? Just theoretically, it's absolutely okay. And even in GTO Wizard, I think it makes sense. Maybe it's tough to balance like 10 sizings out that we always have like a couple of hands in there, but who cares about that? Okay, so first part, out of position after passive action. This could have also been double check, check, check, check, check, check, check, river. Would have been a beautiful spot for thin value bets. Now, let's do that. That was not planned, but now I ask you, what is the thinnest value bet the big blind does after checking down to the river? Same run out. Check, check, check, check. River 10. What is the thinnest value bet, the weakest hand that the big blind is value betting? Check. Let's hide it. 4x. Wow. 4x is wild. Queen 5 for Jerome. He's jack high. I'm loving it. Okay, you guys are going crazy. Let's just show it. So we obviously do some damage with our 10x. I bet every 4x. Yeah, if they check back twice, they have an ace. But actually the 10 is just not a great card, right? So we see, let's start, the 4x, none of the 4x is it's betting, it's just some of the two pairs. The 5-x, not 7-5, not 8-5, not 9-5, 10-5 is a two pair. Jack-5, we see the first tiny fractions of betting, like some trace plays here. Queen-5, a little more, I'm not sure about the suits here. And then, well, from then on we are at the 10 level. Let's give it a different card. Very brickish deuce here. And then you all got your 4. It's about the 10 really sucks for out of position. So here the deuce is a beautiful card. All the 4x, 5x can bet. We have lots of the small bets. Lots of weak hands that are better than villains' ace highs. So it makes a lot of sense. How does it look like on another more like random-ish card like a seven will be also lots of small bets even more right we have the four we can actually bet the five and also the seven now so beautiful beautiful again we see we can use a big bet over bet we can use a normal bet we can a small bet. Now let's have a look at what imposition does. Imposition does check, does pretty much never bet small. I think again if we let the solver run a little longer this will disappear. Like that's pretty much it right so here we use the sizing if we want to go thinner we can increase the size a bit but i'm usually not opening up a smaller bet size than to increase like a hand what is close like eight five jack five and value bet that a little smaller uh no i rather let that go no my threshold is higher and overall use like 85 why not if the card is better for us, less check raise expected. Check, bet, own calls. We get the deuce out there. Check, check now. River is now the 10. Check. Boom. Actually, we see a split in two sizings, but remember that in position when there is room for check raises, usually the small bet size never, never, never exists because the value doesn't make up for the risk of facing the check raise or it's not the risk of facing a check raise for the chance for a villain to build a check raising range where he actually starts winning with hands that would lose a showdown. So that's the risk that he has a real check raising range that we cannot profitably call it against or we are zero EV that include hands that if we would have checked back we would have won. That's the big problem. So here we have the thin value bets with the overbet size. So actually because of the overbet size, king eight starts being a thin value bet. It's a clear value bet for 60% but not a clear value bet for 132%. Alright so here we see that less mixing of the sizings, two clear options and that's about it. Okay, now those were spot number one, spot number two, and I want, this is the third one, where any one of you wants to come up. So I have the river out of position after barreling and board change. Any one of you wants to come up with a hand? I have one here written down actually, but maybe I'm happy to hear another example. Goal is that we try and get lots of thin value bets in on the river. Mantas typing. Let's go. I'm proud of every good example. I'm screening the session I played with this anything that I can sell you as a thin value back and have a look at that hand. I found two. All right. So Jerome going with the tough ones. Okay, hijack open button call. How can you guys not go for blind versus blind? No. Okay. I'm lost now. King9, so everyone else folds. We have the KK9 with a flush draw. KD is set. CB call, so CB will be small here. KK9 small turn is a six of spades. Block again if it exists, let's do that. That's fine. Block again. In position calls. River is the six of hearts. All right so villain has lots of pocket pairs but he has also flushes. So we were ahead a lot with our let's say Jerome has pocket tens. Now the flushers got him but he's still ahead of nine X pocket eights pocket sevens. I guess that's kind of the spot you're aiming at. It's easier to think just about a hand. In that case, I had King, Queen actually. Yeah. Which is a mix of all the sizing. So now we need to figure out which sizing do we want to have. We have a King to value bet. We have flushes to value bet, and we have the in-between pocket pairs, have the in between pocket pairs right where i think every step of the pocket pair like one higher or lower is a big difference which we see like pocket eights well not beating a nine obviously is not strong enough for a value bet pocket nines is freaking nutted not really but middle nutted pocket tens with hard are value bet taking away some of the flushes without are not but actually with they they rather go for the biggish middle-ish value bet pocket jacks want to get called by tens and every nine they actually go for the block bet queens are strong enough to get called by every pocket jacks so there's like this is how every hand is different it's super tough right? And Jerome said he had king queen or like king jack, kind of the same here now, little lookalike, right? The king jack plays more like the jacks. But what we see here is out of position, we can play a 20% bet, a 50% bet, a 76% bet. And now what I'm very, very convinced of, or I also tried, is let's say we have a 20% option. We have, no, I don't want to do it the other way around. No, sorry, guys. Say we have a 70% option, a 50% option, a 20% option. Now let's just say we don't cut down the parameters or the options for the solver. We would actually do like we add a 60% sizing also. We add a 40% sizing. We're crazy and also want to have a 27% sizing. What I'm saying mainly is that especially out of position, solution, solver would kind of split things up because certain hands just have certain value. mainly is that especially out of position solver would kind of split things up because certain hands just have certain value that they try to achieve and then we have other hands like here all the king x that kind of get mixed in to be balanced with all of those right and if we do more sizings then we can also do a 10 sizing and also yeah at some point it doesn't make sense anymore the big sizings because then you rather put your king that is good enough for the big size you put it in like one of the small sizings because villain needs to raise also so this is where at some point there is there is the end so you can't invent sizings and they are all good but if this sizing exists this sizing exists this sizing exists, you can be pretty sure that every sizing in between also exists. This is different for in position, especially when we look at the bottom end of the sizing. So let's have a look at the check now. Definitely never taking that. Very unlikely betting 50%, where now the question is, does it even exist or is it still a solver problem? And again, we have two options, repping a king or repping a flush. This here is the flushes I would say, mixed in with some king-x obviously, but this is all the flushes. And the bigger size is just a few, few, few, oh no, is it even some flushes? No flushes. Ace-10 of hearts sometimes. It's the king and it's bluffs. So this is how in position is just different. This is a big, big learning today. But I started with the talk about position. Yeah, in that case, I had king-queen actually, but thought might have some blocks. Yeah, I think here it's the lookalike a little more, but I would have been totally lost. King with the king queen of hearts you see like everything is kind of same ev you went oh you would you go for the block this year's yeah is it probably just more a side flushes they recharge that are not raising villain should raise his flushes that then that's fine who knows what is really happening yeah i just can't explain that the this the only real small that is the pocket jack so they add the king jack but this is something we'll we'll see later also that at some point all that doesn't matter anymore because how close are people playing to that is king queen king jack does it really make a difference and so on at some point i hate being actually too specific because there's no no learning anymore like this is a once in a lifetime once in a year situation and whether you know that you should mix your king jack and your jacks with that size and queens you can actually go bigger and so on depends on villains reaction so yeah and i thought this was a spot queens jacks tens would block and now we have seen for some reason because button calling range is so tight that every step makes a difference that tens is actually indifferent depending on the hearts jacks is the clear block and queens are strong enough for something bigger but you see it's like here the queens have 0.09 difference in winnings between block and 50 so it's absolutely fine this is not where we win or lose money okay beautiful very good spot the pockets are interesting the flush gets in so we need to adjust a little now let me show you mine i think here the problem that villain's calling range is kind of just a couple of combos and we already do not really know how people play starting there. So this is why I like the blind versus blind a little more here because there's pretty clear which ranges are playing. So I came up with this one. We start with the 10-6 deuce rainbow and out of position we bet half pot. Again we already see out of position any sizing is fine but on the flop that will be the same case for in position. Villain calls, turn is now a king of spades, beautiful card for out of position. We can use any sizings we want like 75, 50 this year. So let's use 75% sizing here. You can imagine again a hand that we have like a King Jack if you want. We just turned our King, the long calls, and now we get like a card that is not that beautiful. Put out a five space. And now check frequencies. We're betting the time we have a 10 bet size then we actually use 20 of the time we have a 35 bet size but we also have like a 60 and 85 bet size right now personally in game i would always even after seeing that would combine those and use like one size normal size i call it and have like a real frequency but the block plus the mini block right like king seven is good enough to squeeze out a little more king jack is good enough to squeeze out a little more depending on the suit maybe it's a little more on the 35 size or on the 10 size just showing this is something you will never ever see in position the 10 sizing is something that makes you so awkward to play against actually fun fact it boosts your red line because you just put out more bets where you give villain a chance to fold but yeah just understanding that that out of position you can pretty much charge exactly like Like you could do like a little training, have every hand on the rubber out of position you can pretty much charge exactly. You could do a little training, have every hand on the river out of position and write exactly down which value you have. It's like you can write down a bet size or a pot size you try to achieve or whatever and it should be slightly different for every single hand. King-8 has slightly more value than king-7 because villains should float king-7 of hearts, calls that down. And if you have king-8 of diamonds, it's just a little more value than if you have the king-7. Obviously, in the range sense, it's no big difference. And we don't need to play differently. But for the understanding, it's quite a big thing, right? That like, why shouldn't you go for the value that your hand has? Just having that image in your head that there is a certain pot size your hand wants to achieve that maximizes your value, that helps you in game quite a lot, right? So if you have ace-4 here, offsuit, you look at the pot size and you see the pot size already exceeded the value that my hand has. So I can think about bluffing or giving up. So here, Ace-4. Yes, Spade has a pretty good value. And Ace-4 of diamonds, that run out is actually an okay bluff. But this is something we need to figure out. It's a different decision here now. You can have a look at ace-10. Is there some more value? Or not? You can look at, I don't know what, right? What else do we have? Like all the king-axes obviously, other 10-axes, 10-9. Oh, it's actually we got too much money in already. Fuck. Let's hope for the check-check or check-decide. Still winning quite often. Alright, so yeah, just wanted to show this amount of different bet sizes. Okay as always I have no clue what's the next slide so let's just go there. Potential exploits. I think I talked about that on the on the side already. Go back to the platform. One of the first videos I did a couple of years ago when Poker code cash started was explaining the dice principle which means that it helps a lot thinking in like range parts or i use the number of the dice where it just means that i try to achieve certain things and i'm not talking about i hope or whatever it's targeting right things right so i can say very clearly with what how strong my hand is one two or three or five or six So and now thinking about villains hands that he still might have Yellow is a very bad color. One, two, three, four, five. And then we need to understand that very often it doesn't matter what we try to achieve. It's specifically or against the whole range. It's often important to achieve a certain thing against a certain range part. And this is what I mean, right if we figure out okay what is our hand our hand we have the freaking super nuts a six we're the freaking super nuts which range part of villain talking about the numbers of the dice should we focus on we have the super nuts what are you focused for the five, maximize versus five, right? So there is a big problem if we think about, yeah, he mainly has like second and third pairs here. I want them to call again. Yes, would be nice. But maybe we are talking about real money here, right? So absolutely, we want to stack him, part so very often for example is this something that goes into out of position into the check or in the block bet because the five then clearly raises and we have room for the all-in and then villain sits there with his five hates his life and needs to end up calling sometimes. So we put ourselves into a position to go all in. What would be very bad is like betting three times the pot to scare him off and not let him raise a 5 anymore if there is more room. What would be great is maybe I'll show you the hand I played before the stream. I played this hand. Beautiful. So Guy 360 hands, slightly loose, fishy 34-21, not a full stack. I open raise threes, he calls. I random c-bet, random mount, he calls, turns beautiful, deuce. I click the hotkey, it should be bigger than that, but I click the hotkey, chatting a bit and four tabling. River is the 10, 7-9 gets there, Q9 gets there. He can never have that. I have enough reasons, I can find bluffs, no problem. Every check mark there is for all the way. And we go all the way, right? And he snap calls it with 8 deuce of space. So here we have the six and he has a five. But what would have happened if I go pot? He would certainly just call with eight deuce. There's no room for raising for that hand strength. And then I would have just lost 37 bucks, which would suck, right? So this is very, very important to think in the dice principle here. All right? I mean here I was more forgetting that he can obviously just call a jack-9 also or a 10-9 or whatever, right? Why not? So I think it's just a very clear value play here, but still the focus on the right things Worst thing would actually be like maybe he has nothing and I check and hope for the best. This is something if we want want to play against this nothing, it's good enough when we have a two or a three. When we try to sneak out last values, like when we have a three, it's like we target his twos. It's fine. Like, what is he doing? Maybe, I don't know, we don't overbet like a weak jack, but like, here it's really, really tough. What do we do on a queen? On a when we have a queen maybe it's another like 75 percent bet against every jack but not an overbet crazy jam when he can have all the 10-9 or some queen x himself or some two pairs obviously like something like that just a pattern of thinking very important to me and i think helps quite a bit right so this is a potential exploits is just thinking in the dice principle already without caring too much whether you are super protected or not. This is like at some level, maybe people sniff that out that you're a little weaker here and a little stronger there. But again, using dice principle doesn't mean that you're betting big when you don't have it, right? You can use that for a bluff also. If you have a one and you want him to fold three, you can also go big for that reason. Or when you have a six and the board changes, like Pierre board in the flush gets there, you can block bet and he has to raise and then you can re-raise. So it's like strong doesn't mean big. And this is something we don't want to have all the time. All right. So what are our victims for thin value bets? It's obviously calling stations and suspicious reacts, people that are calling. We don't want them to raise necessarily. You said it already correctly before. We don't want them to bluff raise us. If they just raise when they have it, that's absolutely okay. I mean, whether they call or they raise and we fold, we lose the same amount. It's just a bad feeling that like, but what if? But if we know they're not bluffing, it's absolutely okay. We lose the same amount. We just don't see the showdown, which that's an ego thing. And one more thing. And actually, I want to show a little video for that. System sound? Oh, I can turn it on. Okay, so maybe I can show that and also first and actually ask copy GTO Wizard how I should have played that. Show in a second. Second, where's the upload? Sometimes it takes. I'll do that on the other screen. To show the hand first, use a little information advantage on my side. I mean, you see how I played the hand, so it's OK. All right, so not this one. Where is the one? King jack suited. OK, so it's up okay okay i'll show that one king jack suited also just before the stream 100 big blinds button opens small blind three bad no info i go for the cold four so far so good we should do that 100 pretty much this guy calls turn is king nine nine nine we flop freaking top here we are not bothered too much by the nine he check raises us tiny now i'm this why i'm a little tilted because gto wizard doesn't offer that tiny check raise and it check raises huge and then it wants me to just get the money in this is why i chose mistake here which i don't see against that that sizing we shouldn't just get it in. So I'm calling, turning checks to me and I even say they're in game. Yeah, all his bluffs have like an ace in them. So there's some protection needed. I'd rather check back an ace king. So I do some bullshit. And he calls and then on the river. I really don't know what he should call me with and i shut down people are not like i don't know and he played king 10 like that which is just i was very sure that top here needs to go in the middle right but this is what i mean shut down versus snits i was just and i'm not saying this is a mistake with the info i have on the pool which is not strong but yeah that something happened before that it doesn't mean too much to look it up now right i knew that it's probably a jam now i can't really look it up because tto wizard is fucked up in that sense that the small check raise doesn't exist and that changes things i can't simulate that even but obviously like that it's like no chance to i mean now it's like with that line if you check raise large and i'm only calling and there's nothing left then i should value jam pocket queens but we are in the dark streets that do not exist here in GTO wizard so yeah now a little pissed that he had exactly the hand and beating that he likely is calling but these were the reasons and fit to what I wrote there even though here I think results oriented it was obviously a mistake. Shut down versus knit. So what I want to say there is if people folded already before or they will fold the river, obviously you need a stronger hand to get enough equity versus their calling range. We want to bluff them and not go for thin value bets that then only fold out worse hands and get called by better hands. Very straightforward, obvious. And now, because I'm talking a lot these days with my buddy who apparently want where is it no I please no close did I close it really much share that okay so this here is what I wanted to show and where is the discord now you should hear the sound also. This is a freaking hand for just a couple of million. World Series of Poker main event. Heads up. You can read it here. No, it's not in there. Final hand. And I actually need to go here. I just guide you through the hand pretty quickly. The more or less recreational. What the fuck, music? No, you don't need the sound, I got you. It's like some discord sound. I want you to hear system sound, what the fuck. Anyways, yeah, I'll guide you through the hand. This Mr. Holmes here, open raises king queen, korai defends 10-7. He flops obviously the dream. Mr. Holmes c-bets for 40 something percent. Korai check raises raises like three point something X, so kind of a standard I think 75% pot check raise or something like that. And Mr. Holmes makes a call. Let's just pretend he has king of hearts, queen of spades, and this is okay. All right, so this is okay. Turn is obviously then the beautiful king. King of spades. Core-right bets, actually I talk to talked to him a lot miscalculates and that's too small he wants to go a little like linear directional in but actually with the double flush draw the smaller bet is okay to leave more room and react on the river and yeah so he didn't plan that at the time but i think he played it freaking perfectly that That's like what is it 32 million? Who cares? And this 36 million like three quarters and has now pot size left more or less so slightly over pot left if this guy calls. This guy obviously calls and where is it here? We see the offsuit nine on the river. Pretty not perfect card. Queen-jack gets there, the backdoor. Jack-8 gets there. The 9x doesn't need to bluff. So actually, I was on the rail there and gave him some info within like one, one and a half hours delay. I was like, I want him to build the pot himself, which apparently was not necessarily correct in that instance. So I would have wished he always bets like random 50 million here i think with the info that would have been the best play but corey goes for some kind of gto play and checks his hand just wasn't really ready that he wanted to snap off like a 60 million bet just like his bluffs his whatever and then actually pretty quickly this guy goes for you guys can guess a thin value bet it looks so crazy when it's just the main event final table last hand or just heads up there but it's i mean his flop call is ridiculous a bit but but this is the right play theory right heads up ranges single raise pot 9x with heart he can check raise ace 10 on the on the flop and continue on the turn and so on so it's a freaking value jam it's actually like people hate it on that guy how can he not check back and so on blah blah it just because koro has 10-7 this time time and you see I mean Cora's freaking suffering right so don't value bet thinly against snits I'm very sure that Cora would really have called a weaker hand not that he never bluff catches here but I think that word that action he was not looking for a bluff heavy strategy on flop and turn here that's the point that he doesn't get there with hands that could catch now i think this is not a good bet even though you can look it up in the solver there is a beautiful finding equilibrium video about that so i love those videos from that guy that just shows the solver if you don't have it explains everything beautifully and shows that this guy actually made the genius play gto play whatever you want to call it korai takes tanks three minutes and then ends up winning this shit but yeah this is where a thin value bet went unfortunately for this guy extremely wrong but i want you to share that with you so shutdown versus nits not saying that korai a knit here, but I think that the situation was one where you can just expect less bluffs. Historically, that's the thing. So yeah, and this is true for lots of players you're playing. So if there's big action, maybe step away from the very thin value bets, especially when Villain also made some action. But the less action, the more I want you to value bet thinly the check check check check spots the check check spots increase sizing especially in position increase frequency use small sizings a variety of sizings out of position squeeze out the last bit of life of your opponent this is the plan okay french money with the question in gto if four from dice principle is the bottom betting for thin value doesn't necessarily mean three doesn't get thin value or maybe three is better ev as a check to catch some bluffs but might still be a thin value bet out of position you want to bet block better three and in position your value threshold starts with a four kind of like that you can use a small size that forces villain to defend like 75 of his range so he calls all the deus ex let's say let's make it a 3.5 is your out of position threshold and the four or like even a little more than that is your in position threshold usually it's like people who know how to bluff, they usually bluff catchy also. That's like my kind of guideline that people project into you what they are doing themselves. So if they are bluffing a lot, they kind of expect everyone else to also bluff. And people who are never bluffing, the nits, they are usually never bluffing themselves or not often. They don't expect you to bluff and this is why they fall that that goes hand in hand so like from my personal experience it's a little tough to say aggro wrecks that overfold but i don't see too many aggro wrecks that overfold key takeaways what i want you to do use both sizing and frequency to value ethically understand position understand the difference of out of position and position. You have two tools to exploit. You have two tools to adjust. Use them. And then know your opponents. Think of our friend Mr. Holmes, I think here, that value bet into the two pair of poor eye. And this exists quite a lot. People shut down, but they are strong and so on that yeah in the spots where people need to make big catches that usually people are still over folding so then it's not the right place for thin value bets but for just putting out the bluffs they are turning things into bluffs and so on i'll answer some more questions one last thing i didn't want to hide from you because this was stuck in my head all the time and this is actually from I don't know the name I would love to to share it because it's one of the like theory papers let's say from 2012 maybe where there was just written down a lot of poker theory in words let there be range let there be range right now let's find the name to give shout out to this guy. Let there be range by... ColdSouth, Tree something, was that Tree something? Tree Nguyen, here we go, ColdSouth and Tree Nguyen, let there be range. So shout out to those guys. Janda is a young gun against those guys. By Tree here's the one let there be range by tree nyan and coal south here this was the picture it's like let's see well how much can we see for free oh let's stop it here anyways you are here chapter one and so on where's the table there's like lots of stuff like that right just like check it out i think it's pretty it's like the examples will play out differently these days but the math should be okay and actually they had a beautiful sentence about value bets and i wrote them down for you guys the value bet is a bet that gets called or raised and this is the important part by a worse hand this is what i want to keep for the end because you guys came up with that in the beginning also when i asked like for for a way to work around the problem of check raising and you were talking about super kept ranges or just knowing that you are ahead and stuff like that this exists maybe you have attended the last coaching and i went for some bullshit in position 30 25 percent bet in a three bet pot where i just timing wise knew new villain's hand and snapped him off when he check raised me so this is the most beautiful check spot to value bet thinly when you know that the check raise range will be very bluff heavy that you can just snap him off. But this is not only more value because he calls worse hands, but he invests quite a lot with worse hands. This is very tough to achieve, but for having the right definition, this also plays a big role. And then this is an EV boost. If we, instead of checking back, we bet thinly and then this is an eb boost if we instead of checking back we bet thinly and then snap him off and actually get even more so just this was stuck in my head and i loved it that so much back then because i was like i don't understand like why should he raise this like i was not really bluffing a lot why should he raise it where it's sad and i was like what the fuck and then i i started understanding that over. So yeah I hope you like that one as well. I had the scooter with us but I forgot the helmet. Obviously I didn't realize and let him ride the scooter a bit but now my wife is picking him up and figured out that the helmet is not there. Obviously my mistake but yeah. Can we ask do you or poker code are planning live cash courses in the future it's absolutely possible we do the mtt boot camps right now i think the next one is around kapt felden poker em on vertase in in july and i want to take my time for that i'm probably not like if i do something like that I do it like a nice place a week or something like that so probably not this year very likely not I'm not doing it this year but it's always in the back of my mind because this is what community poker code is about we have those beautiful events in Vienna whenever I have a chance I try to attend them we have the trips for the tournament players meetups there I would obviously love to have opportunities like that for the cash players as well just my personal availability there is a little low so but I definitely I would love to do that in the future I think that that should answer the question but yeah maybe there's more stuff happening people can set stuff up like I mean I remember Jerome and the guys grinding Malta. But yeah, live cash courses. And so yeah, yeah, that should answer the question. I think I hope if not go deeper and ask again, I'll keep the questions coming. I'm just saying thanks to everyone who attended. See you all next month. I guess I tried to record some more videos, Maybe I can make a thin value bet one with like some good examples, maybe with exploitative plays in there. Today in the 30 minutes, there was like the one called 4BetPod. It is tough to analyze now actually. And maybe one more, but there should be a way to get more of those happening. Just like to get some more real real examples out there as well i'll try to make that happen and then see you in the next coaching feel free it's really tough to make up all the topics if you have anything in mind i'm super happy if you just write me on discord personally or open a thread and i'll make a session out of that pretty sure thanks so much talk to you in discord and here maybe a bit too broad of a question. Out of position I always see as you're betting all your sizings and use your nuts in all those buckets. Sometimes I'm afraid though I should actually just bet my nuts because people don't raise enough or bluff enough versus check. Yes exactly, people are not building the pot enough. I see it more as building the pot so there should should be an equilibrium in a way of building the pot. You need to take over their share when you're interested in building a pot. It's kind of easy rock, paper, scissors. They keep the pot too small. That's what you can benefit off if you have hands that are interested in small pots. And you need to build the pot yourself when you are interested in big pots. So yeah a big big big plus for doing the job yourself. Don't trust those idiots to build the job. Check for Brazil, sorry shout out number four, they help you but like the general other players are not helping enough. All right cool then talk to you soon guys and see you around bye
