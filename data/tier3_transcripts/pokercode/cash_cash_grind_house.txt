### TOPIC: cash cash grind house
 So for everyone, again, if you haven't seen those guys, and I hope you have seen at least Jerome already, then you have been in the coaching or at least watched it on the platform. I invited them again for another coaching. They are in Malta right now, just grinding the shit out of the mid stakes. And I wanted to just like go for a little, ask me anything, because probably during the last three, four weeks, there were lots of questions coming up that lots of you in the chat already had throughout your career as well. So it might be interesting everyone and i'll try it just to answer everything as good as i can and i have my screen here i have a computer so in case i need to run a pyro sim or look gto wizard or we just talk like kind of the business perspective of poker everything will be possible and now up to you guys and shoot the first question yeah we made a little list i think we can fill like an hour with that for sure. But we were first interested in like mass data analysis. I don't know how much like we've done with that, but we came across it a little bit. And it's like, we feel a lot of stuff in game is always like based on assumptions of us, just like thinking, yeah, players are doing this. I think maybe, but not too sure. Like some real data would be nice to back it up do you have any experience with that you see like i'm clicking already like i gotta share my screen now so yeah just start with i was never like a guy like did lots of mass data analysis or like really working with that but i was always interested in what's going on actually so what i always did was back in the days when we had infinite hands and everything that yeah like especially in the zoom pool that i made like big aliases of like how do people play it was more interesting for me where i just want to see how are the best players playing this is one thing and because i had so many hands myself i wanted to know how are people playing against me right so it's just like i'm always interested in kind of i call it the truth where people cannot lie like it's easy to manipulate stats, but like something like you can't lie about. Like one classic example is just like fold versus five bet is one of my favorite examples here. Like we can have so many ideas of like, are people bluff heavy for betting? Are they value heavy? Right. I'm always saying, especially from early positions, people are value heavy and so on that this is the truth that if we have enough sample that well if they are bluff heavy they need to fold to five bets if they are not folding to five bets they have to have it because obviously when i get in aces i was never called by ace queen or pocket tens or like some bullshit so it's like that i want to log in into smart hand smart hand.pro which is a like a site that tracks stats that is not allowed to use while playing but to do like some data analysis but i cannot show you what i did because it's just like one screenshot a way of like telling everything i think about some people but probably show you a screenshot i sent to a buddy of mine so i keep it small on purpose right it's just about the idea what is happening there so what i did there is you see like a big, right? So what I did there is actually like on high stakes for me, this is more interesting that I have individual players I play a lot against. And what I just did was just putting out certain numbers that are accessible, how they play certain stats that I'm especially interested in. And what I did like top right is where there are no colors. I did like kind of an alias of their stats to have like average stats. The pool is playing or like my player pool is playing. And what I did there was now to just compare how every individual player is deviating from that. So my line was like plus minus 5% of something. I don't know what is correct, but I know for like, this is for me, interesting individual people, right? That this guy is folding turn more than 5% more than the average folding river more than five percent more than the average that is stuff that is interesting so i can build like a certain match plan versus every player against that guy play more defensively because he puts out the bets himself against some other guy run over him because he loves the overfold button right something like that this is something but for you guys probably playing a wide pool of like different people it's really just that mass data analysis i think they're like forums or like some stuff that is going on there that people like dive deep into that i've worked already with a couple of those but i was never into it myself because for me it's not the wrong thing actually like i cannot say like mid-stage players are doing this and that because i play the same handful of players every kind of. So it's like what they are doing on average doesn't make sense. I need to go like individual, but it absolutely makes sense. And I would always double check on like, what is your four bet success rate? What is your, like, how often do people fold when you probe out of the big blind after check, check on the flop? That first thing would be just filter for that, right? It's like, it goes check, check all the way. Let's do that right now. This is my favorite spot because it can just change your win rate by a lot. I want to find something that is a little more comparable to what you guys are doing. So game types, I take stakes. I just take zoom 500 zoom 500 kind of this year when I started playing this is now what is this report average number of players something else but right okay of all, I ran pretty sweet here. So Zoom 500 looked good. But now I go for by position. This is just Zoom 500, just 20K hands, right? That is, or like 18,000. And I filter for, I'm the big blind. Position and action. We play a single race pot. Big blind is positional anyways here. So we are in a single race pot and I need to filter for the action that was action filters betting action on the flop it went not check call not check fold and not check race and i checked so it has to be check check i guess let's double check on that all the things here went check check and we have another line turn i decided to check again i did not check call i did not check fold and i did not check race but when turn check check as well and i went for a river bet so let's just have a look like this spot river i bet right it's now very very easy 56 times this happened in those 18 000 something hands and now we have this filtered already with 56 bets and we just see okay one time i bet folded i want to know fold equity right one time i bet folded so two times we have to count those out for what i'm going to do now two times i folded in the end so let's keep those you remember the two and now i just filter for showdown scene this is when i got called 25 times right so like pretty much they did fold 56 times 25 times they called two times they raised me so this should be minus 27. So 56 minus 27 this year, 29 through 56. This is my fold equity. And I was on average, definitely not betting more than pot, I would say. This is just something where you could now filter for bet size and just see maybe put your databases together and see like a quarter pot bet in that spot has like 40% fold equity, random guess, right? And it's just printing money. And then, for example, you will learn that I'm very certain in the pools you are playing, every time you have no shoulder on the river, you can have a profitable bet. Every single time, if the pot is like that, something like that. What else is happening? You can filter for how often are you successful for betting against the big blind? How often are you successful for betting against the small blind? I can tell you the big blind will fold way less because he will be as i always say he will be value heavy right so he will just jam more often compared to the small blind and so on this is something where you can find out the truth with your stats and that's actually another layer of like more interesting than the mass data analysis because it's not how the people play versus the people this is how the people play versus you right maybe some people have stats maybe some people play different versus people with location malta or the netherlands then they play against someone with location israel lebanon or russia right so it's like i don't know it's a little closer to the truth and this now already like talking a lot but this is kind of what i always did i hope that answers the question a little but keep digging if you're interested in more. The only thing I struggle with sometimes is like okay now we have a number but we do not really have an idea of how that like protocol regular number should look like. For example they fall by 40 percent so what is like a normal number GTO wise. Right so what I do there what I like doing this is here the list I do not really want to show but let's just do that so these are the numbers you can find for this player right so the numbers will be like I just show you the like the first three like that starts with a yellow 79 is c-bet in position flop c-bet in position turn c-bet in position river we're like I wondered like this has to be sample this is just gg high stacks so like 44 river c-bet cannot be true but you can kind of see my game plan i play a very c-bet heavy game in position i will start polarizing on the turn and actually my river number should be more like closer to 55 than to 50 actually because i polarize on the turn and then go all the way a lot in theory right so this is something and then you see like the next number that i would see is let's go to somewhere in the middle you see my mouse is the 45. This is actually how often I fold after checking back when villain steps. So this is for example a number that is pretty important to stay somewhat balanced and this is because like okay I'm only checking back 21% of the time so this spot doesn't come up too often. Actually it's not that important for me personally to be balanced. If you only see about 55%, that's way more important. And this is why like an absolute GTO number is not interesting at all. So I'll show you the next thing here. And what is more interesting that you compare things to each other, right? So this is the same numbers. And this is the average of the, I think, 25, 27 guys I put out there. So you can compare the numbers now. Top left again, people on average are c-betting a little less than I do. Therefore, they keep going a little more on the turn. And that 53, I'm saying that this is pretty much the number I want to have. Same out of position, I'm pretty much playing like the average. I'm c-betting out of, this will mainly be small blind versus big blind. I c-bet, then we have like often like a range c-bet or so. In some words, we range check. So this is a wild mix. Turn is the polarization point where we start using bigger sizes. And then on the river, it seems like I go all the way a little more than the average, right? So this year is pretty insane. Maybe a pretty insane number is my fold versus five, but it's this 24 here, right? This is way too low in theory, obviously. I'm just not bluff forebetting a lot, right? So something like that. And here we can compare things. I don't want to say he's doing this too much he's doing this not enough but i can say he's doing this way more than the pool on average he's doing this way less than the pool on average right so it's like okay this guy is folding more than others or he's folding less than other what is another example this year like the second block of three things on the right side out of position this is fold to c-bet out of position Out of position. I fold on the flop 42, which is exactly average. I fold on the turn 50, which is kind of exactly average. I fold on the river, kind of exactly average, right? Makes sense. Is that number correct? I don't know. It depends on the sizes that are used against me. If people use 150% all the time, well, I should fold 60%. If people use 75%, I'm heavily over-folding. If people three times pot jam a lot, I'm calling way too often, right? So it's like, this will average out a little. So my hint here is don't try to find out correct numbers. No one will do that because it depends a lot on sizes you use and so on, but compare it to others. I show you one more. Let's go for one more. I don't have to show a name, but it's like, this is so fun. Like, it's like my eyes are bleeding just because of the colors I use. this year someone i'm playing it's like boom red green yellow whatever that means so this guy is c betting way less the 68 you can see that but then after the 32 he checks back he decides to overfold the turn massively this is the 64 here right so first thing that we could learn from that well against this specific guy i just want to defend everything everything because this is kind of a spot I get into 32% of the time. And I create EV no matter my hand. I don't need to flop top pair to achieve that EV, right? So what would be okay if he c-bats, I can call. And then on the turn, he will only double barrel 40%, which means 60% I get into the spot, check, check, which then means again, okay, this year is how often he folds the river right it's like ah 66 he's like even over folding more than i do right okay it takes some effort to get into this spot you need to first call a flop bet you then need to hope for the check check turn and this combination here of him not c betting often having that exploit him not double barreling often and then massively overfolding it's just lots of free ev lying around on the table right same thing he out of position is c-betting way more 65 instead of the 52 or the average but what happens if he checks what would you guess i don't tell you which number it is i mean you can guess which number it is it is one of the highly read well he's just betting when he has something and he gives up when he checks like check folding 67%. Honest, it might be possible to defend any two profitably against him, big blind versus small blind, as long as he doesn't catch up what we are doing. The first hand, I play against him next time. I think I could profitably defend seven do's off. Just because of small things like that. But this is now specific again. What you can do is really compare your, put your database together, your three, like this is your average for now. This is how you are playing, right? I have me and my best buddy, a cash game buddy here that I have like his stats. What a surprise, look pretty similar to mine. Just not the big blind per hundred. He wins way more. Yeah, it's like, and then I can compare, okay, what are they doing differently than we are doing? Right there, it's like, for example, some people that are incredibly passive, but I mean, I don't want to go too much into detail here because individual players are not interesting for you you need to find you can do an alias find that and you see like confirmation it helps so much in game yes we know they are overfolding here yes we know they are overfolding here yes we know they are always having it when they forbet it's like right maybe i'll like this year where i did that for one individual player now as well kind of my goal of that is i want to go to the fight having a plan i sit down on the table and i have examples where like hidden name pre is like insanely folding to three bets and he folds a lot to four bets like kind of a result of that go crazy please like i give myself a job pretty much go crazy when he is four betting you can just throw everything away which means at the same time i'm just ripping aces all the time no traps needed i can fold pocket tens against his under the gun for that stuff like that i'm just naming things that will be typical for your games as well i would say then i put something like post flop as aggressor in position plays a very c-bet heavy game comparable to mine but with way weaker checking ranges all right he has same frequencies like i have but he's not protected what does that mean his c betting has to be stronger it's not like he's throwing good hands away on the turn no he just checks back his weekends so his c betting range is stronger already than mine personally whereas the ev well not making crazy calls probably but just waiting for him to check and then just take the pot and stuff like that all right and then post versus aggressor in position i have the important one here starts over folding on the river i have them this guy marked as a knit but he plays kind of perfectly or on average until the river and then the big overfold is there so it's like for me important yes i go crazy and maybe here the guy to the right the bottom right this is like the knit brown the 79 is actually wins at showdown when he raises the river like this like when you value race you shouldn't win like more than 80 i think so it's like really he's just doing that with a freaking nuts that's like you find stuff like that but this year right so for you you can filter find a way to filter for bluff catchers for example and double check your river call efficiency and if you put together you probably just played like together like 200 000 hands in the last weeks this is a very solid database of like how people actually play versus you yeah question how many hands did you play how many did we play i think far over 200 000 i think like i think i played 200 000 myself yeah he is going very hard and yeah i think we're at 400 000 plus a little bit of even better database right something to work with to work with. And it's like, actually, it's not old. Right here, the stats I got here, it's like older than a year even, right? Where like, it's more collecting ideas. I need to prove that what I want to do next is really like when I review hands, I played against those. Does it fit? Like, did I see against that guy making it kind of an ambitious turn call that like a nit wouldn't make, but I know he's calling the turn normal, making some close calls to then have the chance to overfold the river dramatically but something like that will i like to create that bigger picture now it's tough to do it for just a lot of time to do it for those individual people but like for the pool just like how does your play work out double check your fold equity with delayed bets double check it with bet check bet lines what i like doing is actually go with a game tree right you start on the flop you bet you check you have the fold equity how often is what happening so we went to the turn say you see bet go for your average size just go for your small size you will have like 35 fold equity or so right then you go for the double barrel you can go for the 150 only 150 only or you say like you have 150 you have 75 and you have check back what happens next right it's like just writing down those numbers so this year let's say is the check here we go for the check and then what happens next villain checks to you how often is that happening not that interesting but on the river again you can bet or check how profitable is that bet by this year right full equity and this is just something you have easily enough hands to just double check those lines and just filtering for each line once a little sizing relevant maybe can be super cool super cool, right? To just, once it's written down, you have the proof and it's way easier. People, it's like something then changes in your mind. And I have to remind you that people don't know what you did. So they will just keep playing the same while you can just know, okay, there's EV, there's no EV, there's EV. And yeah, this is something that is definitely very, very helpful to just have that confidence in your game and where the money is coming from. Yes, it sounds very good, man. Sorry, one second. I just want to see, because I don't have the chat open, there's something going on. Yeah, absolutely. People play different versus me. Yachi makes a good point. Actually, would I jump into the NL50 pool now, for example? I cannot use mass data analysis because people play different versus me. So I hope that versus you, they just play versus, like I say, like even they play different versus someone with a dutch flag or with a flag from like somewhere i like looking at your database way more than the random mass data analysis but this is obviously the first idea that you can get yeah okay we were wondering a little nowadays you have gto wizard and stuff but you have all the sims that you ran in the past if you would go again now without all the sims you ran would you focus mainly on gto wizard or how would you go about studying nowadays this is really a tough one because obviously with the background knowledge i have it's like i think i can use gto wizard way better than like anyone else who lacks that knowledge right because i don't take that for granted what gto wizard tells me let's make an example someone open raises button big line calls flop is king nine deuce like i'm just saying right it's like okay i can easily range bet that board if i want and we're like i know the sim if i only offer 25 it's 100 c bet yeah well i see this year and this is just mind-blowing in a way like it kind of kills you or like oh is this relevant or not where it obviously helps to just sometimes still run sims right so using gto wizard to just look at stuff and understand what is what is good what is correct can help a lot but we want to understand why so here why does a range bet make sense well actually you don't find a single hand that is not okay with betting small this year ace eight suited is the one that wants to clearly check back but it's same maybe whatever right so this is like one example let's make actually another example because i think what we struggle with is like or what i struggle with at least is like sometimes in gto wizard i see a lot of sizings and then i just here i would just go with the size i just range bet whatever like 33 or something and then i just go deeper in the game tree but it's not really correct for if i would run it myself for instance well i just show you what i do right so you need to talk while playing right or like think it through and say like what is a big big big mistake to be doing is to go for the two ticks on the right highest frequency this is a fold we know that and everything else is not okay right so when something is not okay it is not okay but what is happening i'll. There's blind versus blind, right? So here we could stat. We have the king of spades. We can check. The frequencies, I don't give a shit. This is important. I want to know, should we bet big on that board? Should we bet small? I'm pretty sure it's more of a small bet to just fold out random nine, jack, eight of clubs, something like that. So this time I'm checking and I'm like, I'm not playing with a randomizer whatsoever. This is my logic and I'm double checking my logic check now king high i can fold what a size i have the additional gut shot it can't hurt i think any sizing is fine i go for a bigger one this time and now on the river i hate to see this card so i'm just giving that up bluff huge thing can be fine as well right so just my thoughts where we get the correct moves and now what would be the mistake would be to look at the turn what I did wrong. For lots of people, this is not correct, right? So here, what happened? Remember what I said. We can check, we can bet. Mainly, it should be a small bet. That's what I said. This is what we see here. Turn, we can bet. Definitely, checking back is not a mistake, right? Checking back is better here because it's 7% more frequency, right? It makes sense to use the bigger size, the small size. Oh, maybe do we understand why that is not that great. River, bad card, so we give up. It's not the perfect hand to bluff with. Obviously, we could do something about it, right? So we have in numbers what I just said, pretty much. What I look at is this here on the left. You don't want to make blunders. You don't want to make wrong moves. This GTOW score, it says 97. It triggers in your head that I didn't play perfect now, but I did, right? So it's really, really this number is full bullshit this is like a video game and you try to reach a high score which is designed in a way that it doesn't make sense to reach it i make one other example i don't want to pull that up here but i make one example let's say we are big blind versus button three that pot if alex you're around we talked about this this morning so let's do the board nine three deuce rainbow all right can someone of you tell me the strategy? Big blind versus button on 9-3 deuce rainbow. Just in words more or less. Yeah. Bet big or check. All right. Bet big or check. What does that big mean? How big? Or 100 big blind stacks? 75. All right. So you're saying 75%. Okay. So which is pretty cool. So how often do you bet big with pocket jacks? Very often. 90. 90% and you're checking 10. Okay. How often are betting with let's say this is the nine of spades, three of diamonds, deuce of clubs. How often are you betting with the king jack of clubs? I think not super often. I need numbers, I need numbers. Okay 30%. All right so what if you play GTO wizard drill are you doing? You have pocket jacks, you click on bet. You have king jack of clubs in the same spot, you take the safe click on check right if you use that tool to train yourself like that right you will do that and this is exactly what people are doing in game this i chose here that in my opinion most value heavy spot you have ever seen right people when they bet big they have jacks and tens and queens maybe with ace king they start betting small and this is one of the reasons here because this gives you the two ticks in gto wizard this is just one tick right and it's a chance to mess up the check cannot be wrong which just makes a lot of sense and this year is just clicking it as a video game here i'm saying like understanding why that is the case why do we want to bet big we have the huge advantage now we don't keep it over time any turn card is kind of destroying things a little for us so we want to rather get the money in now or later so with jacks 10 screens let's just verify that big blind uses a large three bet call we get the nine of like whatever it was a club in there we see the sizings we use here it's offered 80 and some half pot so the big bet you simplified that to 75 only i like it right and we have the check so we look at the pocket jacks and i think we are solid with the, I don't know, king, 10 of clubs. Actually, another 90% as well. If we go for like king, queen, we get to the 50-50, maybe a little more. If I go to the small blinds, it's less betting, right? So let's just see if the small blind should be a little less betting. And nine, three, two, we go here. Maybe that's a little more nice to what we wanted to see. Maybe this year, king, jack king jack offsuit like a king jack with like only one of the suits fits like to our description a little better here but this year is just what is happening and this year is just right what i mean with understanding i'm looking at spots left and right i'm not looking for like 10 in a row with right ticks i'm understanding the spot but i just asked you like i think your answer was absolutely good and fine and then maybe we see more spots coming up so really we need to not take that as a given thing we need to really take that as a learning tool like it's really not i'm double checking hands okay it was okay done no it's like you don't want to double check your hand without a question let me just pull something out of let's say ran a little above evie so let's look at a random hand random big hand i don't know right okay we look at that hand like what you could do now what i don't like actually we could export all those hands upload them in gto wizard and look for mistakes this is not the way like you learn a lot right it's like double checking and like clap yourself on the shoulder if it's like somewhat okay like yes maybe it feels good but now this is not how you're learning all right so this is how you can be learning okay we have pocket queens we are like you know 10k play against a quite an aggressive good rack open race he three bets or is that 700 we four bet right not going into detail now what about four bet sizings i do not use the gto wizard four bet sizing for a purpose but he is calling right now first of all i'll ask you again right asking questions you can ask those questions yourself and then you have gto wizard to answer them what's your c-bet sizing that you use with your range or multiple sizings if you want to 50 i think i'll do it but yeah for me it's more like i know like i'll go just out of position for it but i mainly go 50 or check if it's a board like 10 high or something. Mainly sometimes range bets quite often, I think. Yeah, which is absolutely cool, right? Maybe one thing is, well, it's more half pot when ace king and ace queen do not hit. And it's more like quarter pot when they hit, right? Maybe just something small like that, which is like, okay, half pot. And now he jams. Next question. What could you ask yourself? I'm not giving you the question this time. Jeroen, you ask the question to the subs behind. You have to come up with a question, a good one, that you could ask those guys to answer. Is this a thing? Good question. Is it a thing? Great question. Ask your guys. You don't need to know. I think it's a thing. So now follow-up question. Which hands do you want to do it with? We could kill that hand. We call our pocket queens and everything is cool, right? But what are the hands that the jamming range should have in right what are hands that you can jam here in position i think flash draws jacks queens yeah jacks queens right in equity against ace queen and ace king get it in against maybe a random 10x or just fold something out get called by some ace kings what about spades yeah maybe also something like seven six students now we have a question right so we have our little friend here and we can just ask sorry guys but this program is just a little better in poker than you guys are so we just ask the program and this is the way i want to use it right we want to get better at the game and not like try to copy paste stuff right first of all we said we mainly use half pot right here we can use some small the main sizing is half pot if we look at the hands we see that most of our value part want to use the half pot the small bet is here for pocket tens for king 10 ace 10 thinner value like some pocket nines like invulnerable hands and thin value hands this is a pattern right i could write that down but we are like like this is something to learn right i just show you how i'm thinking in that spot and now button how should you react to the big sizing you sizing? You guys were talking about queens and jacks. Not too bad, right? Not too bad. Now question for everyone. Which jacks do you prefer jamming? The ones with spade or the ones without? The chat all says without. Oh we're going with. Okay you go with. So we go with. Here we go. All right. I wasn't sure myself, right? But it's like it's just more equity is better in that spot because the jacks sometimes can find a fold so that's kind of an upside seeing an ace on the turn allows our jacks to fold while the ace of spades on the turn fucks up the jacks with so like it's equity goes in in that spot but there are other spots where it's actually the other way around so it flips with queen queen that makes a lot of sense actually but yeah right this is not interesting we have those spades want to get in that cannot call a turn jam this year that dominates actually our bluffs we are bluffing king jack just clicks on call call right it's like easy kind of yeah we're now okay villain let's double check what did villain have we didn't like always watch the end boom we win first and then ace 10 of clubs right so we see that here ace 10 of clubs did Willens play fine, guys? Chad, everyone, do you think he played fine or do you think that I think he messed up? I think he played fine. I think you think he messed up. Obviously, he didn't play fine. I think half-court too strong. No, I tried to play like that, but I four-bet way bigger pre-flop and his ace-10 suited is a very, very bad call against my four-betting range for that price. Actually, my only bluffs are like buffs are like ace jack on the ace x side just because i use a 2.5 7.5 20 and we go 22.5.27 from like not from 7.5 it's from 7 to 22.5 that makes a huge difference for exactly like those hand types that are like you see it's a mix anyways they are indifferent right and this is why i size bigger against certain guys because they can't help themselves but click on the call button when the chart says so so actually he made a mistake and kind of i don't know whether that then is a follow-up mistake he has to stack off his hand obviously but now right this is now something we can find out all right i hope that answers the question like a little really you cannot use the gto wizard without using your brain at the same time and like using your brain often means just asking questions like you mentioned earlier already with the example you gave us on the 932 rainbow versus the big blind range i think it's pretty common now that that range is pretty value heavy i would say so how do you adjust your calling range versus the big blind pivot range so which hands do you prefer calling on which hands do you start calling if you compare it to the gpo strategy okay so first of all i want to answer yachi's question like the thing is he needs to know you are sizing up with value but not bluffs obviously i play one range and one size it's just because i use a way bigger sizing he's more incentivized to five pet jam i have a different bluff value ratio yes i have different hands and that exact range i'm for example not four betting that large with lower pockets for example yeah it's just like he plays reaction game and he plays his chart but i'm playing a different game yeah good luck with that after he does three bet i react to his three betting range and i already go for his like he's calling light so i'm sizing up everything actually my bluffs benefit from that as well if i have four bad bluff ace queen and he calls ace 10 suited it's good on both ends for me so like he could kill me with more five bet jam in that spot but okay the question how to adjust that so what i did was i mean it's bluff in the way that i would fall to a five bet i asked like to answer your questions now i asked a friend to run a sim against what i think a real three bad ranges so this year we're assuming 500 ranges button versus small blind button versus big blind let's take a look at top right button versus big blind i think this is something you have seen before more or less yeah you showed this somewhere i think i've seen it probably right this is soon 500 ranges like i don't know monker solver pre-flop sim or so but like what i like is often understanding that, why is King-Jack off, for example? How is it here? King-Jack off is better against the big blind than against the small blind. This is not actually that just someone explained to me lately, and I was never really thinking about it, playing that almost the same. We're like, yeah, villains are from the big blind, not three betting King-Queen off high frequency, so we are less dominated. And people are not three betting Ace-Jack off that often. just something like that is interesting we're like oh maybe you know that those guys that you're playing are never doing that makes king jack maybe a better hand maybe not right so this year is button versus big blind against the correct three betting range and this brings us to the same scenario that we were just discussing with the ace 10 suited this year is assuming playing against the 14 to 15 three betting range you can now with your 400k database analysis figure out exactly how often you get three bet from the big line it will be less than 14 it will be 9.3 let's say right so i didn't run the sim for 9.3 but i ran it for or a buddy of mine ran it against seven percent so here we have the answer pocket tens are indifferent because we are not beating a single pocket that villain is three betting. We are literally set mining, right? And then there is not a big difference between pocket 10s and pocket 8s. The difference is that we do better against his bluffs if he finds eight, nine suited once in a lifetime, right? This is why this hand is better. Ace, queen offsuit is a fold or actually a bluff four bet, which doesn't make sense here because this takes into account that villain knows our four betting range therefore adjusts right then he knows how freaking tight we are and he's indifferent with queenston but villain will obviously fight for jam queens or at least get it in somehow so like the queen king jack suited like you see how things can change right so knowing that this year is that villain in the last hand did not to that extent right i was just increasing my sizing by two or three big blinds and i had a solid range that i was playing but he was kind of playing his chart that was just totally off against the there because of the sizing and here it would be against just reacting to the range so we cannot fold too much like be proud of yourself folding against those people and jamming like i want you to see like to jam pocket kings in their face they will call ace king they will call queens they will call jacks four bet jam it i don't give a shit right they have it and we have better right follow ace queen off if you feel like it that's cool i have followed king queen suited from under the gun against big blind three bet i'm not making money against ace king and aces like one question is a very good one what can happen is well they can make money with bluffing okay good luck start bluffing please and the question is actually where do we make money with that hand right where do we make money often those people are just very bad post stop as well so all those in different pockets actually get plus cd to answer the question correctly is like i want to call hands that know on the flop what's going on i don't want to chase like call once call maybe one more time one more time against the range that's built aroundax plus Ace King. So it's like, I want to know, I stack you on the flop. And then in a crazy way, just rip it in or like something stupid, right? It's like, it's okay. When you know they have it and you have better, get the money in before something bad happens. I see. So you're for like low buckets over like low suited connectors then? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes. I mean, low suited connectors. Yeah. We flop draws. It's kind of, we know where we are at. The thing is, we want to end up polarized. Let's say we want to end up polarized, which means we're not flopping middle part. So 10-9 suited is the worst 10 you could flat, right? It's like you play against jacks. No, it sucks, right? To that here, it's like, okay, you know, your bottom pair is not worth anything. You have a five outer to two pair plus or you flop a flush draw. That's good. And your straights are good. That's cool. You cool you can call those if the price is fine and again it's a difference whether you open raise 2.2 and villain makes it 11 or villain makes it 13.5 it's like it's a big difference so this is something to keep an eye out for for sure okay thanks yeah i also have one question about like overholding like kind of love overholding you know and but we just don't know exactly how far you can go sometimes so this is kind of similar to the other question but more like in post-flop spots now often i hear you say as a kind of a guideline for yourself he can bet the same hand for value so i'm not folding there like i'm drawing a line but now often i think like okay he can value bet but probably not going thin enough either and he's under bluffing as well so how certain do you want to be that he's value betting the same hand yeah it's like i mean this is kind of the line if people play correct right then it's just it means okay if he's having like a somewhat okay bluff ratio plus we beat one value hand it has to be clearly plus cb right or like we have the same hand so this is kind of the line but obviously if he has value bets only and we beat one of those it's a very stupid idea to call yeah actually you cannot go too far i talked with my buddy actually two hours ago about our samples this year and we were talking about over folding and i my fold numbers are higher than his and we compared river call efficiency we compared blind versus blind calling down like big blind versus small and just calling down or just like in any spot where there is a river bet includes like check check bet and bet check bet and he's calling more and more correct than i am i'm the crazy over folder because i think people are having it i don't know like he has a way better win rate but in this spot he was burning money he had like you can guess a high stakes crusher really winning like all stake what was his river call efficiency blind versus blind he is big blind river call efficiency, all those hands. I think it was like 6,000 hands in this year that were in that spot. So like one would mean he's break even for every dollar he invested. And just think about that. Sometimes you have the nuts and you call, right? So it's not that you're having bluff catchers only. So we have a 0.8 and a 1.1 so far, which would both be really, really ridiculous. So maybe for those river call efficiency, I just explained that again is for every dollar invested. This is the dollar amount you get as return, right? So RCE1 means break even on average. And like, let's say calling a pot bet with the nuts would be like RCE3 or I'm not sure whether it's three or two, actually, whether your bet is included or not. You call one and you make two. I guess it has to be two then. So like two would be you win every single time. I'm not 100% sure, but a little like that. And your mix of calls, what are you calling with? You can be over two with the river call efficiency, I think. I said it's a pot bet, right? That like you win his bet and the pot, that would be two. If he over bets, it can be more or something like that. I'm not sure. Maybe this is defined as three or as two. I don't know whether your bet counts as winning. I think it's more like three. What are you calling with is a mix of break-even catchers that should have like RCE1, right? Clearly plus-eV catchers, like beating value, but not strong enough to value raise. Clearly bigger than one and nuts, and nuts right triple barrel you call an all-in you call with the nuts like yeah it's like nuts should be depends on the river sizing okay so we got still in the chat only 0.8 and 1.1 i need numbers from you guys that should be winning pretty decent i think i think lower i mean one is breaking even right yeah and you search for catchers or for nuts included everything everything in that spot just That's the total spot. Okay. I think it. I mean, one is breaking even, right? And you've searched for catchers or for nuts included? Everything. Everything in that spot. Just the total spot. Okay. I think it should be a little below one. If he's really burning, then let's go with that. I don't know. All right. So the number was 0.85. And that just means he would have performed even better this year if he folded every single river. Literally every single river, including his folding his nuts. Which like just has to show you how bad that is like either he ran super bad there or it's just like a lot of lots lots lots of bad calls what you could do for example is you can just like little exercise for the three of you you can filter for face river bat is true or call river bat is true you have spots and like jerome looks at like the database of the others and the other way around that you don't know the hand that helps to not be biased and you evaluate is that a break-even catcher that you think about doing or not is it a clearly plus cv catcher or you can even think is it that in gto wizard and then you have a way of filtering that right you can just like tag those hands break-even catchers and then you can guess what the rce for your break-even catchers is it should be one right and it will be something like 0.6 and then you know okay in the future we can just fold everything that we evaluate break-even catchers so if like up to a certain point if you play same guys again and they see you fold every single river might start bluffing you right so this is something where you can see the truth again that you can just with the massive databases you have take some work but probably better work invested than playing the next two hours very very often so yeah okay sounds pretty good all right one last question maybe you touched up on it a little bit already but what are spots you think like where do you really print and what do you think you should really focus on to know the best because you're printing there you know all right so i call them the money making spots and that combines three things positional advantage range advantage not advantage so we can kind of play in a way that we get in those spots more often right so we can open race lose from cutoff button we will end up in more spots where we play cutoff versus big line but versus big line get this game tree together right know your flop plans for certain flops. Know your turn barrel plans. You can run over people on those stakes, right? You can size your value as you wish. No need to be balanced, right? You can triple barrel like three and a half times pot jam rivers against some people only for value. Against some other people, you can just run over them on like with nuts when there was like a straight on the board on the turn, but a double draw and you know they are just always check raising it it's like you can't have like 100 fold equity in spots like that right so this is we can be a little more loose to get in that spot more often this year is a great spot people start over folding because people don't want to be too tight from the small blind because they love playing hands it's really tough to fold ace deuce off which is a small blind fold right so it's like very likely that people are too loose in the first place and then defending it's like three bets out of position when you don't want it four bad hands like king ten off is really really tough so probably you start with a little jump start of like fold equity already and then you again created a spot like that learn that spot and then three bats too wide in position empty cut off but this is your spot right's have a look. I compared my stats to yours and I saw yours were way higher in that area. This is what you want to do, right? Because again, what do we do? People are not necessarily punishing you with cold four bats. Like why should they, right? Better fold ace queen off again. And out of position defending versus three bats, they don't four bat enough. That's it. Like this is something I know from mass data analysis. It's just a thing because we know as well, they don't fall to five bets and they play three bet pots out of position poorly. They are not check raising correctly. They don't dunk correctly. So it's like, yeah, you can win. Let's have a look. Cutoff versus MP. This is Zoom 500 ranges again. This is what we see here. I don't know, even on high stakes, when there was the last time I folded pocket nines on the cutoff against an mp race so my range against if i play your stakes now right i mean that's a little unfair maybe but this year is my range and let's say this year is a shithand and this year is just something that i have sometimes and those perform pretty great if people are shit all right so we got up to 14.5 percent instead of i don't know what it was before like 10.5 or maybe like something like that for now how do you kill me you format king jack suited i'm folding the world i'm folding 65 to you like you print money good luck formatting your king jack suited instead you call out of position and play against you with pocket deuces what do you think who is on the better end here having range advantage not advantage, like, it's pretty cool. So this is the spot that we want to manipulate to get into more often. And maybe one more spot. This is what fucks people up. Like... That's a small blind, right? Nope. We are in position this time. Again, I want to have the position. We don't have the range and nut advantage, but we're like, it's close when it's a tradeoff. Villains, c-bets, jacks, seven, something like this. Now knowing jack of spades, seven of diamonds, five of spades, knowing what like the solver suggests raising and upping the frequency a little of that is very, very nice, right? So because people over fold flop, people do not re-race without nuts. And this is already two clear points and people over c-bet likely, right? So this is something and big blind versus small line versus check on boards where in position has advantage those are your spots i make one example all right last question is that one question i have for you guys so let's come up with a good spot then we race big line calls we get a board of a63 we start stabbing half pot villain is obviously not check raising 14 raising 14% here, but he's calling this time. Turn is a freaking jack of clubs. We mainly should be going with normal size. Yeah, like mainly nine. Okay. Some overbetting and the river is a good card. Let's take a good card. Where's a good card? What about a nine of clubs? Nine a good card? I think a nine is a good card. Seven of clubs. Okay. What's our betting frequency river off the sizing that means all in that's a big blind right yeah half pot on the flop we keep going 75 on the turn and now i want to freaking jam the river for three times pot or so what's the frequency of that 15 15. laughing higher right he should have check raised like a ton right yeah i mean he doesn't have like four or five and he shouldn't have like nine ten that's the main thing yeah so we can go like crazy crazy crazy I think right and we can value bet any sets because on that drawy board he needs to fast play his strong hands before like we have 16 combos of 10 9 suited or like 10 we're not stabbing all of them here with that like it's multiple sizes on the flop wizard now so we won't find but we have it a lot I think we can blast like 50 of the time it will be less because we have so many hands with showdown value that check back but we can blast obviously right so check and we have 25 and really using that we're like it looks so nice here i actually think against most people on nl50 you have like you should have 75 fall equity i think you should have more so it's like those are you should have more. So it's like, those are fun, right? Okay, one more. Let's take a 7-7-3 board, rainbow. Don't worry that the turn and river will change. Again, we start stabbing. This time we start stabbing big on that board. Turn is a nine. So what do you think is our main sizing on the turn? I would go with overbet. Yeah, probably send it around the trips, right? 125. I think it's actually the normal 75 because we want to value bet a nine and keep our range together. Some overbetting, but mainly normal. So here, even half pot on this, we are value betting some 3x as well, some 7x. And actually what we want to do is we want to force villain to fast play again his nut at hand. So this overbet, I was doing that a lot as well. I just learned that recently that this is not a thing on those peer ports. We kind of want to make sure that Villain doesn't have a seven for sure, right? Oh, you don't check raise the flop. Now you don't check raise the turn, but our sizing forced to two. And then obviously, you know what's coming. We'll get the six of clubs on the river. And after betting 11.25, how often are we jamming the six of clubs on the river? 40%. Taka loves it. All right. I don't know. I'm just making this up. So I mean, only 30, but the other 25.5% are just the casual 150% overpass. So it only go with the straights and the seven only goes like 150%. But this is very close to the 60% suggested. So close it down. So this is the spot, right? If you learn that. I don't know when the last time you played on this board, this line, right? I actually didn't do it often it often enough. It's like mainly because people like always fold on the turn, but it's like maybe we overbet the turn then we create a different scenario right here in that leverage. We're allowed to freaking blast every queen 10 off we get there with. It's like I mean this is fun and this just makes you lots of money again. I created in a way like now with that flop, I created again a spot where we have range advantage, nut advantage and positional advantage. This is what I want to focus on. The reaction game, try to not make huge mistakes. That's the main goal, but you design your action game. And this is here, those spots and the ones that we try to get as often as possible into. In position, range advantage, not advantage. Cool, I think this was a good last question. Thanks guys for joining in. Having very good questions, I think. I think good luck from all of us. Thank you so much, man. It was very insightful again. Really loved it, man. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Have a good one. See you, man. Ciao. Bye-bye.
