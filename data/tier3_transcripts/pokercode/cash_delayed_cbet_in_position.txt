### TOPIC: cash delayed cbet in position
 So maybe for everyone who is watching now on the platform, now we get started. I'm just reading out some questions from the chat and I'm five minutes late, but we'll make up for that in the end. No worries. I'll go too long as always. Okay, cool. Let's go. 30 of you here. And as always, just to be sure for all the beginners out there, I will just quickly explain the spot. And then what I came up with, I will just give you a very, very easy guideline today for how to play that and actually i came up with that guideline obviously i play a little like that but i i came up with that because i wanted to make it as simple as possible that i yeah i came up with that while browsing boards and actually then tested that yesterday playing gto wizard and i was, very surprised how freaking well I did in those by just following those ideas I will present today. So it's easy guidelines, nothing out of this world, no rocket science, some easy logics. And then you can kind of crush a GTO Wizard. And we'll talk about different board types. Actually, just two of them. Everything everything else will be in between sizings and structure of our betting ranges then i'll have two examples this will all be a little together not as structured as it looks here and then we'll talk quickly about potential exploits we will have a little browsing in gto wizard today for the geeks out there we will have a little paint games today for the fans of that today and as always i'll leave you and go let you go crush with some key takeaways all right if we don't range bet when we should isn't that too obvious against good players we don't have air but only a bluff catch this is very specific i don't know when when i should range but i'm usually doing that if i don't do like a big exploit and check back top set i don't know often an in position delayed c-bet probably is a good exploit in many player pools I use it often as an exploit that itself cannot necessarily be an exploit because it's part of the game tree the question is do you do it more bluff heavy more value happy like you go for a sneaky greedy value maybe something like that but we'll discuss that are we talking about delayed but in position against good player or bad player? As always, we first think about what would be right with GTO wizard example. How should the game be played? Then when we talk about potential exploits, we make up our mind what people are potentially doing wrong. The weaker the players are, the more they will be doing wrong to then talk about what can we do against those players. All right. Basic thought, if the flop hits the opponent's range better, I check. And if I pick up some equity on the turn, I bet. Is this good? It's definitely not wrong. The flop hits the opponent's range. As the open raiser, we usually always have an advantage. So there shouldn't be anything like 100% check back. If this would be the case, villain should always be donking. Would be like the out of position range bet then. But yeah, it's like we want to check more and even stronger hands as well. And then we obviously need to be, when villain is strong, we need to be more selective with our hands. So using equity hands sounds like a good idea just in general, Jojo. So yeah, obviously two sentences are not enough for a good strategy but it's definitely leading in the right direction all right let's go let's start with the board types and the spot sorry for the beginners what i wanted to say what happened is we raise first in in one of the first four positions in a six max game so or obviously earlier positions in a nine max game as well so it's like button cut off hijack low jack we open raise and the big blind or the small blind defense in all our examples this will be the big blind and the big examples i've prepared is button versus big blind playing range big large ranges wide ranges really showcase what's going on the best in the add-ons i also play under the gun versus big blind where things are slightly different just because the ranges are very, let's say more asymmetric that the under the gun range is just so strong that we can get away with a little easier strategies maybe. All right, so this is the spot and then the flop goes check, check and our important villain checks to us again. So we have the option to fire that delayed bet. Maybe we are scared of the check raise, then maybe we are whatever, maybe villain has nothing. What are the goals of our hands? Which sizings do we use to achieve that? This is what we are talking about today. Okay, let's get to the board types. And therefore, I want to just show you how we can easily work stuff out there with GTO Wizard or with our brain. Both works absolutely fine. GTO Wizard, as always, is a shortcut, just showing lots of things. And I want to split up board types regarding flop strategy. So you already figured out and you talked a lot about range betting. Obviously on all the boards where we we are range betting we don't care about the delayed betting tree because we are just not like playing that one right once we see that we will never get into that spot there's no way around it right that's pure logic that's the definition of a range bet so those boards do not interest us what is interesting for us is the boards that we check a lot, right? There we have an option to get into the delayed game tree. So the more we are checking the flop, the more it gets important for us to know what we are doing in the delayed game tree. Another part would be how often villain probes the turn, how often he does that after check, check. but since this is more yeah and in villains just it's more villains decisions i did not really take that into account obviously there are some boards where he should be checking a lot and some boards where he should be betting a lot right if it's like a low connected board with another low card villain should bet the turn a lot even though we check back often that would mean we don't often get into the delay bet situation right something we get into the delayed bet situation a lot would be one of our favorite boards which will again make one of our examples the good old ace king four we use a large size or we check but obviously we have a beautiful advantage that forces villain to check a lot again on the turn so this is the spot where we just end up in the delayed game tree very very very often Thank you. beautiful advantage that forces villain to check a lot again on the turn. So this is the spot where we just end up in the delayed game tree very, very, very often. Can you enlarge the screen? I think it's full screen. It should be like, can someone help me out what what Depper Dave means? I think my I'm, I'm showing full screen if I'm correct. It's full screen can't go more than full screen. Maybe you can turn your phone around and it is showing like the wrong way around. Where you have a small phone screen, right? Yeah, I can't make the text bigger now. So, but I'll talk about everything. So it's not absolutely necessary to see. Once we get in paint game, I can try to make things as big as possible. All right. So now let me get to GTO wizard first. I can't kill this. I can't kill this and kill anything that I need for the recording. Nope. Tab, move, tab in new window. All right, cool. All right. There's something I did not really use myself so far, but I think it's very, very cool. And what I did here is just I put in the spot here. So the button open raises to 2.5, big blinds, big blind defense. Flop is, I don't care about the board. I needed to put in an example that goes check, check. The turn is jack and villain checks to us again. And then there's my stupid face in the way. But what I clicked on then is not the strategy EV that I usually look at. Let's get my face out of the way. Right here. This year, what this would be the delayed game strategy on that board. We'll get to that example later. But what I looked at is this, no, not turn reports. Actually, I just looked at the flop. Sorry. I'm jumping a little. And what we see here is down there, a full breakdown of strategies we are having. Thank you. I just looked at the flop. Sorry, I'm jumping a little. And what we see here is down there, a full breakdown of strategies we are having. I just killed the paired boards because they are lots of range betting. And therefore, we have an easy, easy overview. On the bottom left, you can see this might be really too small for you guys now. These are the Ace high boards, then there are the King high boards, Queen high boards, Jack high boards, ten high boards, and so on. Obviously, there are way more ace high boards than there are five high boards, but we see broken down the strategy, and I'm just looking for lots of checking, or I'm looking at different board types, different strategies, and this is very, very easy. We can look at something like this board. Ace, we see it now broken down here a little and this brings us to one of our favorite boards. Let's click on this here. Ace, king, four, rainbow. And this is one that looks like the following. Overbattle check. We looked at that slide very, very often already. So lots of check, check and villain will check to us very often. So this is important. And we have other hands, other board types that are also big bet or check. Maybe we take a king board, a little more of a mix. But here we have a king, queen, six with a flush draw. Same thing for me. It's like 50% check or we do some big betting. We can simply find used small bets. It's fine. But for the sake of the video of the of the theory today we want to get into the delayed game tree all right so right now i'm playing that personally with big bet or a check and i switch to range betting from earlier positions for certain reasons so this would be another board that fits to that and then we see lots of boards where we only see the light red like Like it could be something like that, an A7-4 rainbow. It's as well like over 50% checking, but we only use a small sizing. That must mean something for that board and will change things for the turn also. We see something like this year, about 50% check with all those low boards, 7-6-3, 7-5-3, 7-4-deuce, stuff like that. Mainly small betting. So I'll put those together. We see some mixes here as well, some big betting, some trade-offs and so on. And this is pretty much the only difference I made, right? So I started with two board types and the first one will be the one with the big bet or check. All right. So as always interrupt me, I'm happy to, to, to answer all kinds of questions in the, in the chat, but this is just how I started doing things here. Everyone can do it in his way, but yeah, it's absolutely something that works out for me to just get smarter and then like kind of try to to prove and see how it works in the drills. All right, so that brings us to the first board type. I call it board type A for today. It's the board type where we have an absolute clear advantage and equity denial is not necessarily needed. This is when I try to describe those boards with words, right? Where this big bet or check is happening, right? So here it's ace-king-4 or ace-queen-9 with a flush draw, or something like jack-10-4 with a flush draw, queen-10-7 with a flush draw. The big bet is very, very effective because villain has lots of hands that connect with that board, but he's not really nutted in that situation right he does not have the top sets he does not have like the the maybe some of the two pairs he sits on all kinds of gut shots mid pairs weak top pairs and stuff like that so maybe the second thing no equity denial needed is very very clear on ace king four anything that villain is folding out there, we do not really care about. Like whether he folds his 9-8 now or not. It's drawing to a shitty third pair anyways. But to understand something like jack-10-4, obviously it's great for lots of hands if villain folds like an ace or a king. Like an ace-6 offsuit. Just like he has three outs to make a top pair, but we need to see the strength of this top pair relatively. So those are the cards that give us a huge advantage because we connect so well with it. Let villain hit an ace with his ace-six. He will still be in a lot of trouble. This is what I mean there with equity denial is not absolutely not necessarily needed. So I'll just show that quickly. Jack 10. What was the example, whatever we take Jack 10, four with a flush draw, and have a quick look at the strategy from the button. We see that small but can make some sense. But the large majority is really like here, this combined 38% betting 75% or 125% pot. So this just shows us that fits in my head now in the same strategy. The KJK in 85, for example, Ace-King-4, if we don't just range bet instead of big, what are we doing with all our small pockets? Give up is absolutely wrong. We try to realize our showdown value and we probably start really bluffing big with our lowest ones. I can just quickly show you that sim. I mean, it's in pretty much every second theory video that I talk about button versus big blind because it's just such a nice board to show things. Queens, jacks, tens, nines, eights, sevens, sixes, and then fives, we start bluffing. But it's not a give up because there's 5.5 big blinds in the middle. And by checking pocket sixes, we still have an EV of 2.2 big blinds. So it's not a big success if we fold something out, right? Actually, we invest more money into his aces, ace-axe,-x, and lose a little there. Okay, it's what ColdSmile taught me, always range bet when you should. It's a can option, right? It's a can option for simplification. It makes things easier while sometimes giving up a lot of EV, sometimes not giving up a lot of EV. So the better you get get the more nuanced strategies can get while still using one one it's like a two like two bet strategy it's a check and a bet if you just range bet you are missing something out and like a hand like ace king clearly wants to bet big we see the ev gain just like here written down and we can understand where that is coming from yeah maybe okay let's all right cool oh okay cool this is the board type a and now we've already figured out okay we still do lots of checking because when we use big bets only well we can't range bet anymore we do lots of checking that means we'll get into the delayed game tree a lot right so now we need to talk about betting structure and sizing so now we can just look that up it's like i just wrote it down there i didn't want to ask questions there it's just we very often and this is the first golden rule actually i didn't didn't put it in the key takeaways but but I think it should be in there. It's just we continue with the plan from the flop. The plan on the flop, I can show it to you again, is go big or nothing. The plan on the turn will be go big or nothing. Because still, there is no reason to deny equity. Small bets are just there for equity denial. Okay, so now i'll just do the check check villain doesn't bet often just to show you 72 percent check so we absolutely get into that spot or should get into that spot very very often and then it's on us to come up with a strategy again we check a lot The majority of our range is trying to get to showdown cheaply. But now after check check, some hands get stronger. Some hands get stronger because of the turn card. Some hands get stronger or all medium strong value hands get stronger because of the check check before because we can discount some nuts in villain's range as well. So now something like ace 10 is a strong value hand something like pocket deuces just improved 7-5 is a nice bluff now king deuce ace deuce obviously improved ace 9 all right so now instead of always sitting there with like ace 5 and thinking about maybe betting small or a 6 or maybe king queen we have a clear answer right we have our guideline the flop plan was big or nothing the turn plan is big or nothing this is the goal on those boards we put pressure on villains medium strong hands or we don't because we realize lots of showing value with all the king x we're having pocket queens pocket jacks so on. Okay so now just breaking that down big and polar is the plan right so ace king four rainbow and the turn seven ace queen nine with the flusher turn king same thing right straight getting there doesn't matter jack ten four brick same thing these are the examples and the structure of our betting range is very, very clear, polarized. And our bluffs, the value hands are usually pretty clear and the bluffs are just very, very equity and blocker driven. There is nothing like we deny equity or we need to have certain domination effects, whatever. So here it's very, very clear. And actually this is the example it's on here, right? Is that we can just break down easily what is happening, right? Value is very easy. Everything that likely has more than one street of value. In ACE6, the second street gets close. This is why it's indifferent. At ACE9, most of the time we have two streets and hope that Willem calls down ACE6. So this is where we can just make a cut instead of introducing what lots of people are doing, a medium sizing. We just check it one more time and go for a big sizing on the river. And now the question is, what are our bluffs? Because this is the tough thing here. We still want to take the best bluffs and not be random. This is absolutely important. And therefore, I want to have guidelines stuck in my head. So here we can just, I just wrote down what we see. We take bluffs that are no showdown value and equity. We are so strong on this board, the villain cannot even bluff all this shit. So he will check down some Jack and 10 highs. All our queen highs win still quite quite a lot it's like more than one big blind if you can't see it it's like queen nine suited is 1.29 big blind cb that's right now not bluffing maybe later depending on the river card but they are sometimes winning at showdown so we do we go with like queen three suited now Now we go with jack five suited. We don't even bluff queen five suited necessarily. We obviously take seven five suited, eight five suited. So no showdown value plus equity is a very, very clear sign for let's go. And then when it's tough to find equity that has no showdown value, like queen jack would be a gut shot, but it's a horrible bluff here. We are giving up on so much. We are giving up on hitting a queen and just winning against queen nine type of fans right we we dominate everything that he would fold to just start with the lowest right another reminder is your lookalike principle our main value bets are ace 10 ace 9 ace 8 offsuit right this is why'm looking at the offsuit side. This is our main value bets looking at the offsuit side. There is nothing else. And this is exactly what we are bluffing. 8-9, 10-8, 10-9. We're giving up on a queen. I never said the word give up. I'm very, very certain. Do you mean that after Willem calls a big bet, the queen won't be good anymore? Absolutely. That's it. We would just play our gut shot and we are giving up. Yeah, we are not giving up. We are giving up the EV of our showdown value. That is what I said. Yeah. Maybe I got you wrong, but... All right, cool. All right. So now what helps here a lot is to just see what happens if I'm betting. Actually, I wouldn't split it up. Like 75 or 125, we see both is reasonable with like 2%, 2%, super big. Why not just go like pot size as a standard? And then we can look up, let's look at the big one. What is happening if we bet? And as always, we look at the offsuit side. What's happening? And fold out 10-9. Fold out jack-9, jack-10, queen-10, queen-jack, queen-9, which is beautiful for something like 10-9. Not that we have equity against his calling range, but just think about the other part of the game tree. If we do not bluff and it goes check-check and the river is a 9, we lose. So this is just not good. While with queen jack, we are not bluffing, he rivers that same pair, small cooler for us. It's not that there is money going in the middle, but just like structuring that way that we always end up winning. All right. And here you see like that a big bet already attacks a king. Villain only calls like ace-x and king-x. is why hitting a queen wouldn't be cool anymore. This is what I meant with giving up on the showdown value of a queen. And just there's not much incentive having queen-jack and folding out jack-9. Okay. So this is just something that helps me a lot. Just see, okay, what is it, right? It's like is, it is. Second, we start with the lowest. And if we are not really sure, we just think about what is villain's offsuit part he's folding. And we look at that part that is dominated by that the most. What is dominated the most by this shit? 10, 9, 10, 8, 9, 8. So actually 10, 9 is dominated the most because Willem shouldn't have much of that 8x. Okay. Beautiful. Cool. That was the first and very clear, easy example. I think it's good to just have a look at another one. So I'll take a board like that here. Jack, 10, 4, maybe something different. Jack, 10, 4. And also deuce. And what do we see here? Again, we could argue for but we want to fold out his ace, X, we want to attack bet small. No, forget about it. We had a clear plan on the flop. That's the same plan on the turn, just that maybe other hands are good enough. So here we see, okay, again, we go for this pot bet or nothing. This is where we can pressure him. What do we do? That deuce doesn't bring new value hands. Not really. We have the deuce value hands, I mean deuces, no equity hands. I wanted to say, well, can we take the check backs we had before? 8, 9, equity driven. King queen here, equity driven. I mean, this does have short run value as well, but has good effects good effects folding out ace highs getting called by something we have infinite equity against and then we start with the weakest stuff the weakest stuff here being something like a queen three suited a queen five suited just an overcard this is also equity right weakest stuff no showdown value king three king five king six queen six no matter flush draw or not and maybe you can keep that in mind how the strategy looks like here and you can guess how often you delayed bet pot size with your queen six of diamonds here in your last x thousand hands and then maybe we get a little to what people are potentially doing wrong okay so very so very, very clear and easy rule. When a board is big bet or check, it will stay like that. So maybe one more thing we can look at, let's go back to our beautiful ace, king four, and do that that I mistakenly wanted to do when showing the flop reports is that we just look at the turn reports. What are the strategies on all turns that are available? All right, it's always big, just not on the four. Ace, king are somewhat special, right? Because then the nothing versus nothing gets more interesting and equity denial plays a role, right? They're on. It's a little different. We have some exceptions, but the standard, whether it's a five, nine, or even queen, jack, 10, it's big or nothing. Can group on ranks and suits do not matter here, if you tell me how I could do that, but I'm really bad with that. But don't understand hand like 10, 8, too bad. You need bluffs. It's the lookalike to ace 10, ace 8. And you fold out 10, 9, you fold out jack 8, which is very, very good for your hand. If you just think in raw equity that you fold out. Click on the arrow down close to report port's turn. Cards, you said probably, right? Ranks, cards. Here we go. Thank you said probably right ranks cards here we go thank you all right so just the four and then ace king a little special mixes everything else big or nothing so yeah very very easy to remember that problem is if you only bet equity on the turn and all the equity gets there on the river you don't have any bluffs on the river absolutely right you need those bullshit hands where just that for me the perfect thing is really the lookalike what is my value hands ace nine ace eight offsuit right i remember on the flop from the flop over betting ace 10 is my line i'm not mixing that much ace 10 is my line on the turn i start with ace nine minus and ace nine to a seven let's say and those are my hands that i'm bluffing what's our thought process when turn does bring an equity shifting card? A flush card or a queen king is both great. A queen king shouldn't change much. Maybe we can bet more and have like a variety of sizings, even just as a little upgrade to our bet big or nothing. A flush card might change things. So let's go to that jack 10 and just start with a deuce of hearts, or we can look at the turn report in a second and start with the strategy first. But what we see here is a little more mixing like half pot, 75, a little more than that, still no small bet. So we cannot overbet as crazy because people are protected on flush cards, but the small bet still does not exist. When it is not there on the flop, it won't be there on the turn if it's not the special card like a four or maybe if there is a jack, you can maybe protection bet pocket fives, something like that. Like very, very special spots. Let's have a look at the reports now with suits. Any turn? See like, yeah, on yeah on 10 those paired cards make equity denial interesting everything else even hearts we go big or do nothing all right we have king five we are good for bluffs absolutely all right so not forgetting king five of diamonds let's go all right all right so really this is a very very very very helpful it helped me yesterday so much playing gto wizard that i just know what i can rule out most of the bet sizes i go big or go home and then it's either a clear bluff right we're polarizing it's a clear bluff or a clear value bet anything in between we're mainly checking right the queen mix here, go what you want to do. But it's mainly a check. Size down on top card pairing though, no. Well, the top card pairing means less of those pairs are available for both players. Dylan has less of those too because he checked to us on the turn, which means now it's about equity denial. And this is the reason why we start attacking different hand types so if the top here top card peers i still think it's not crazy with a small betting we've got like 11 percent here like i said the pocket fives maybe i gave the 10 pairing as an example pocket sixes that they just want to fold out something like an a7 right and now they're not running into too many better hands just because the board rules out lots of better hands. So that's more the reason. But the standard is still boom. It's not overbetting, obviously, anymore. And maybe the frequency does not really decrease just because we add the small bet. But is there a single hand that clearly to bet small still a no i don't i don't see one that is over 50 queen four suited is maybe the one all right cool let's keep going so now we've learned the first important thing board type a once you figure those out you have an easy easy easy life on the turn if it's checked to you again but since you have a huge advantage, it should be always an easy life and you should love those boards. I'm loving those boards. You can go crazy. It's beautiful. Okay. Very easy strategy, polarized betting, nothing in between. Let's go. This was the example. Let's go to board type B. This is the bigger type of boards and kind of includes all the mixes, right? So like, what do we consider like jack, seven, four with a flush draw? You could bet a little bigger. You could bet a little smaller. Everything makes sense. I try to phrase that into words always. And I said like, it's no clear advantage. Villain is usually uncapped. Like any mono board is like special one maybe. Maybe something like six, five, like the low boards and usually equity denial is important. If we look at those ranges quickly again that we have here, the big blind, and again we want to look at the offsuit part, folding out ace highs, king highs, queen highs is important. Everything else does not exist as often. So when we talk about equity denial, it is really about folding out ace highs, king highs, queen highs that could make a top pair, which on lots of boards is a very strong hand. So this is it where the type b is small bet or check i include lots of the mixes there can be mixes between board type a and b where like both is fine and we see like lots of maybe half potting or trade-offs stuff like that but i want to show the extreme ones let's small bet or check as clear as possible so something like that would be I'll just ask you give me a couple of boards that are small bet or check as clearly as possible small bet or check ace seven deuce all right let's try and find it here we got an ace high board we're in the small betting region here a seven three a seven deuce rainbow all right let's have a look ace seven deuce. What's the plan? Mainly betting small. Okay easy. Secondly we have the second example king nine five. I don't think this is correct. Lots of offsuit gut shots. A big bet can make sense. This could be one of the the mixes right. Big bet makes sense. Smaller bet makes sense. We have a big strategy can make sense this would be one of the the mixes right big bet makes sense smaller bait makes sense we have a big strategy a small strategy you can come up with whatever you want you can range bet that board with a small one you can you can cheat a little and do both you can try to follow that here whatever we have the jack six five a rainbow jack six five i think. I think this should be correct as like a mainly small, right? So a small, like half pot, a little, but not really the bigger ones. I consider this a fine one. And we got the 6-5 tray. Oh, hello. This is definitely one of those. This looks beautiful. All right. So let's see. I randomly wrote down some. So not that the ones that will be shown here are better now. Obviously, the Jack-5-5, a paired card where like any paired board pretty much. But this is one where we don't have the advantage. 6-5-deuce. Someone said 6-5-3. So that makes me happy. And the 8-6-5 actually is not a perfect one. I should have put in the 8-7-deuce instead, right? The 8-6-5, I can see some like more half potting as well. Let's see. That mix. But that's fine, right? Just excluding the big bet. The big bet always clearly says I'm polarizing on the flop and I'm charging you now. The small bet means, oh, we're starting a little something here. Out of position is supposed to dunk. Not really. Not against the button, really. I mean, there's an option, but again, for me, it's once there's a hand clearly wanting to do it. Yes. Okay. We can donk here, but this just shows me there is no EV difference. Okay. 8-5 deuce mix board. Yeah. So lots of those. 10-10-5, a small but clear advantage for us. Leads to size down when out of position donks. Oh, because we face a weaker range. That makes sense. That makes sense. So maybe we would need to run that in PIO, but let's just remember it like that. So with the words makes it easier because then we are not that specific with more types. We don't have a clear advantage. Villain is uncapped and equity denial is important. That usually forces us to not use big bets, whether it's a little more of the 30% or a little more of the half pot. I don't care too much personally, because it does not change the logic. Jack five, five, eight, six, five, six, five dues. And then motorboards a little tricky because on the one hand, everyone is uncapped on one of the boards. On the other hand, equity denial is not that important because lots of fans are just kind of dead that have no pair, nothing of the suits. It's like when we have a flush, villain is drawing dead with any hand that has like not the boat option. So this is kind of a special one here that I want to exclude a little from this board type. I wrote it down here anyways. Exactly. If villain is un unkept it makes it easy for villain to face big bets all right so now we got to talk about the turn and now since those boards are on average a little lower right the ace king high boards where we don't need the small bet just for like maybe range bet reasons for simplification but not from equity denial standpoint means that it's very very, very different cards, right? If we think about ace, king, four, pretty much any turn card is the same. Yes, the queen, jack, 10 brings a straight, but whatever, everything else is kind of brick. Here on the six, five, deuce, whether it's a deuce, five, six, a three or a four, seven, eight, nine, or a broadway is a massive, massive difference. so for thinking about the delayed game tree here it's very important to be to be like open-minded we cannot make our strategy on the flop already for the turn now i'm asking you for all those boards which turn cards are most important to prepare? So you can take your board, board of your choice of those three or any board of the mentioned ones where it goes check, check. 10, 10, five, I'm not interested in because it doesn't go check, check. But all the others, which turn cards are we interested in? Well, to answer quickly, Hiatsu's question is he checked twice. The first check doesn't mean anything, right? Everyone is checking from the big blind on the flop. And the second depends on the card. If the card is good for us on the turn, I mean, I'm taking the majority of my nut attempts and put them in the check raise range, expecting Willen to value bet according to the new turn card that improved him and add bluffs accordingly. So absolutely, there should be lots of nuts in a double checking range. And here we go, right? The right answer, high cards, right? Cards that out of position checks often. Exactly. Cards that help us are the ones we need to prepare because first, Villain will check more often to us. It's a good card for us. Why should he bet a lot? And secondly, well, we will end up will end up betting more often right or not more often necessarily but invest more money on average so this is important to invest money well with the correct hands right so it's way more important on how to continue playing on six five deuce king or six five deuce ace compared to six five three, where a villain just ends up block betting everything. 6-5, exactly, right? So now this is very, very important. And now sizing and structure. It's very tough because I try to cover as many spots as possible in that little coaching. Obviously, we could split that up and dig deeper and dig deeper and dig deeper, but I just want to open some doors for you guys that you can work with a little closer than so don't get confused this is the overall one where still type a strategy is still on there so now regarding type b for the sizings i can already tell you that they are both sizings there is big and small usually right so everything exists on pretty much any turn card and the big size is nothing else but the big size from type a right big sizing is just always equity driven right our hands need to qualify for a value bet or then add bluffs and bluffs are chosen wisely either equity or just some kind of lookalike whatever is the best option to use as a bluff the small bets i call it here domination driven just it's it's like equity denial driven maybe another slide i changed it actually it's about equity denial right it's it's kind of value hands that well are just thin value and want to fold out like random two cards or are just exactly those bluffs that benefit the most from folding out random cards and there again we want to just like imagine which hands is villain snap folding to the small bet which hands is the snap folding to a big bet and this is a little it right it will be very mixed in the GTO wizard, but actually in real life, we can clearly make certain rules there, I would say. All right, let's have a look at one example here. The example being 7-6 deuce and a jack on the turn. That was the one I showed at the start because it was still open from preparing this one. So I'll just open it again. six deuce and the jack of clubs on the turn. So I didn't go for the king, I took something a little more in between. I know I talk about the king and everything I want to do is just put in a king. Cool. All right and we see that clear clear clear split here. So this is actually as well why I chose the jack. The the king will be a little more on the big sizing the jack is a little it's the perfect mix right we got 14 of the small size we got 12 let's add those four percent like 16 of the big size and it looks like a wild mix but once we understand that split and i think we split here, right? The small bet is too good to not do it. And the big size, well, we need it, I would say, right? So yeah. And let's have a look what I wrote down here. Big sizing value is pretty much everything that beats the jack, right? Everything that plans on getting two big streets in like kings and queens are sometimes check on that board we can take those the strongest jack maybe like ace jack king jack is did we have some traps do we have some two pairs yes jack seven jack six absolutely that one and then we have the very very logical big bets like eight nine if we checked it back 10 9 10 8 stuff like that but yeah that's kind of about it and then for the small bet is like anything anything else we want we want to bet for protection like i missed here something like the max like this is kind of a typical thing the the in the big bet is the one top like top here from the flop that needs max protection because there are no over cards or like only over cards to it is like the seven, five suit we see here is like a very, very, very, very special one. If we didn't see that it, well, that's a very typical one we see all the time. And the small bets are like, like pocket threes can bet small pocket fives can bet small ace King, ace queen, just to leverage your advantage a little, right. And not end up checking everything. Can we talk about why we bet ace-two suited but not king? This is way too specific, and I would need to search for the answer here. I have no clue. There will be a small, small reason we can find. But it's probably king-deuce is folding out lots of king-high. So I would look into now. Now I need to. I can't help myself because it's ace highs call. So we have the potential cooler still for us. And king highs will mainly fold. Let's have a look how that looks like. Offsuit side is where your eyes should be. Then we fold out king 10, king 9, king 8, which we are not interested in with king deuce. And the majority of the ace highs are still calling. So have our potential cooler for us tiny tiny tiny difference all right again what needs we need to understand is again this year i'm thinking about this year that offsuit part that i want to fold out queen 10 king 10 king 9 queen 9 so that pops up in my mind that 9 10 is the hand i'm just very very very often betting because i benefit so much from folding that out again offsuit side makes combinations and maybe have a look for yourself how villains should react here this is big blinds reaction to a small bet just keep it in mind for later have a quick look what you think that maybe your opponents are doing differently. Has Big Blind less protects his checks as more often we want to use small bets? I know the direction you're going. I think you kind of phrased it slightly wrong, but we'll get to that. I cannot answer yes, but in a way, you're going in the right direction. A protect for me is really checking the nuts, and that is not really a factor for the small bets. I will get to that in the exploitative part. Okay. So, okay. Important concept to keep in mind. Let's have a look, quick look at the reports for the term, because I actually cannot dig too deep here. This is something where we just need to train because there are lots of like multiple strategy spots. But to, i want to like want you to have two train of thoughts in your head that small exists and that big exists and this is most right for most terms right we see all those mixes here a queen a jack on an ace they are small and big on a king there's mainly big but still some small everything is a mix everything is a freaking mix and we need to understand what are the goals of certain bet sizes right especially that domination effect is important pushing equity and building pots coming back to the racetrack i could paint a like draw a little and paint now to know exactly where your hand wants to be in the end cleaning your outs is a very useful term for that concept of folding out air that dominates our hand. Exactly. Cleaning outs. Usually that cleaning outs means that we have a nice value bet once we hit our hand. Like let's say we bet queen three on the turn, villain folds all the better queen x or almost all of them and then we hit the queen. It's a beautiful large value bet. After check check, if villain bets on the big side and we even have just a bluff catcher, right? So it's like, yeah, we can make our hand a good hand. But that concept is also right for not planning to value bet, right? If we bet the turn here to fold out queen nine and king nine, and we have nine, ten, we obviously won't value bet a nine necessarily again on the river, but still we did our job. Okay. Very cool. The small sizing. Yes. Strong ace highs. Any PR, just anything is fine. And the mix-ins, right? The nuts are just mixed in. We see like some of the queens are still betting small. Some ace jack is betting small. So maybe keep that in mind for the exploitative part as well, because this might be something people forget. And the wild mix start again with the weakest hands. Just cleaning out queen three, I said, king three, just betting those is pretty. Okay. That brings us already to the exploitative thoughts. Any questions so far? I'm rushing a little through because I want to get as much info out to you. As I said, there are already two add-ons produced or like I recorded them. The guy who needs to produce them and cut doesn't know about them so far. So if you're watching, have fun with those. And there will be plenty more explanations and like specific spots and examples. And yeah, still feel free to shoot your messages. And if not, I'll open paint and we'll talk a little on the exploitative thoughts. And actually to start that, I want to ask you, still feel free to answer, to ask questions. Ask you, what do you think? Question number two, what do you think are villains doing wrong? I don't ask you for exploits, especially. I just ask you for what is the typical villain on maybe lower stakes doing wrong? I don't ask you for exploits, especially. I just ask you for what is the typical villain on maybe lower stakes doing wrong? Not donking. I mean, I said, I'm not sure donking for me means only donking the flop when we are the aggressor. The turn, I call it probing. If it's after check, check this bet. Try to be specific there because like we use different terms. I use mine obviously, but just like give me the clear part of the game tree you're talking about that would help me. All right. Leading the turn, right? Leading works out for me as well. Probing. Folding too many A size. So we have SUR once is over holding versus the delayed bet. Or maybe even on the flop. Okay. Leading the turn, not leading the turn enough turn enough okay not betting enough turns versus check back flop so another not leading over fold versus delay bet as they over probe turn so one said not leading enough on the or not probing enough on the turn now he actually says not probing enough or too much over probing the turn something is off here here. Something is off. Actually, I think both of you mean the right thing. And again, you need to try to be a little more specific. The more you can manage to be more specific, the better your comment will be. Over probe equity under check raise small size. Okay, absolutely. Yes. Probing for value too much and not protecting their checking range.'s too often with strong hands and medium hands not be aggressive with their perceived board range okay i think on my stakes they have good probe frequencies but checking range is still too capped fun players over probe random hands just betting for no reason yeah that's cool being too passive to be honest i monkey bet regardless. Okay, let's see how things work. Let's talk about villain's range, right? He checks everything on the flop. So he has still a somewhat linear range, no matter the board now, right? So he has everything. Now on the turn, he should split things up, right? He should... now let's take different colors. He still has that range, but he should bet. Depending on sizing and board structure, he should bet some strong hands, but he also should check some strong hands. He should definitely build a polarized betting range. Maybe sometimes you can probe and like merge all peers. peers i'm not talking about that but the bigger size he uses should be like somewhat polarized and has lots of bluffs as well right so a polarized betting range and that leaves his checking range like that right this is now the checking range black again what does that leave for the checking checking it's like some air that he still checks the biggish medium part that he doesn't bet and some nuts that he should have right so this works perfectly on a board like ace king four right where he just doesn't have many nuts and we attack that with big over bets sometimes it's just everything is kind of air but i think you get the point okay and now well if he checks to us again this is the range we are attacking this is the range we attack with big sizings with our linear part right this year is attacked we attack that with equity driven range and big sizings. Okay, now one question, how big can we go with our sizings? We will talk as general without examples. You can have a little A-Sking 4 in mind, but I'm not talking about hands here. How big can we go with our sizings? Soostisch uh why not bigger okay mammoth already here with the answer depends on how capped out of position is so now let's this is the thing right if villain would be absolutely capped we could go to e-directional in he never has better and this is something we learn in every second coaching if villain doesn't have better we want to use all our stack right this is like when we river something he cannot have we freaking jam 500 pot all right remember the low peers as weapon where we check jammed 100 big blinds with our bottom pair blocker after checking down. So now this here, I want to represent that like that. This here influences that. This is the direct connection. Okay? If villain is not checking nuts on the turn, we can go freaking wild. And that makes a lot of sense on words where we have big nut nut advantage anyways like ace king four six like if he's betting sixes all the time at a6 we can take our ace 10 and ace 9 and freaking blast the shit out of him depends on how capped let's go bigger right not to going too crazy big because villain is still uncapped if he is that right this is not something we can we're talking exploitative here this is something we need to evaluate and we need to understand that connection it's not about the solver telling us 125 or 75 but if we know someone who bets every flush he turns we can take all flushes and go to e-directional and it's unlikely but against bad players who always bet when they have it it's like recreationals this is i need you to understand that connection this year prevents you from going incredibly big all right so now another part is this year what do you think is linked to this year this is villains villains. I'm snap folding. I'm giving up part to betting small, right? So we want to bet small to deny equity. Denying equity means villain folds hands that might win at showdown. Here, the perfect example is not ace-king-four because here we are not using a small sizing. It's irrelevant, right? But it actually means a villain folds hands that might win at showdown. What needs to be the case that villain very very often has hands here in his range that fall to our small bet here we go sur1 got it right people who are not probing who are too scared right those that are not bluffing every bluff you've seen like i put i marked lots of his weak hands red because those are the ones he should put into his bluffing range when he's not bluffing those what will he do instead he will not be check calling he will not be check raising he will be check folding so whenever people are not bluff like the passive players actually are the ones you can bluff the best because they don't even feel like they have a bluff catch decision they just check their i, five, three, 10, and they check their queen jack and they check fold every single time. When we bluff small, are we giving EV? Well, do they have so much medium part there? It just means they are over-folding because they have too many of those hands. This means we make EV. Well, sometimes, obviously, when they have it, then they make more money. But just that means their fold equity is bigger than it should. It should be because they are not bluffing the turn correctly. So the double exploit would be to fold versus their probes and to delay bluff more. Exactly. Yes, yeah, it should. We need to decide whether they have more bad range or more medium range. Yes. My favorite victims are those that use multiple turn sizings as probing and they they have bad hand strength. Let's go to Ace-King-4 maybe. Where is it? One more GTO wizard. I lost it. Here it is. Okay, let's quickly go to ace-king-4. There are lots of people that are not using that overbet on the turn. Probing. After check-check, you should overbet like ace-10, ace-9. They do that with like 8-5 maybe, with their two pairs maybe, with their sets maybe. But then what they do is like betting 75% with ace-9, ace-8, ace-7 and bet that all the time. They're just like trying to get to the money point they try to get to, but not with a consistent range. First, you can attack that incredibly well. You can easily raise your ace-10 against lots of opponents there. And their checking range is missing something. So they are just like, yeah, their protection is is missing a protection in the sense that they are check raising you but they they value that instead of check calling the right hands so this is this is a favorite when you see like multiple hands multiple sizings that often this is just hand strength all right so we have the first two very very clear exploits if people are too are too capped, double checking, we can increase sizing. If people are not bluffing, bluff probing. You can see that a lot when you have like a probe stat or anything, or you can double check that for yourself. They are heavily overfolding versus delayed bets because there is no other option. People who are not bluffing there enough, they won't make up for that by check raising or by calling lighter. Like this is where I said, try to remember that one, where was it? Seven, six, deuce was the example. The seven, six, deuce, and then a jack on the turn. I think this was our example. Let's take an off-suit jack now. And we bet small now right so let's see what villains should bluff queen 10 a little king 10 a little king nine a little queen nine a little do you think people are doing that there are some people who are checking almost range here right so if that is yeah almost range so what will they do with king 10 king 9 queen 9 that they have 100 percent once we bet 1.8 they fold fold fold fold fold and probably they fold ace eight ace nine as well 100 it's indifferent yeah i think it's against most players it's good to fold but this will lead to not what should the full act be 37 fold i give you 60. it's more a realistic number i would. Another thing is people are probably then not check-raising enough, not check-raise bluffing enough, not check-raising thinly enough with like ace-jack and so on. Okay, so this is something that I think are exploits that you can make use when you do delay bet. Because people are answering incorrectly. What you can do when villains are delay betting is actually, I think you can overfold, right? Because it's very, very tough to find that amount of bluffs, to see all the King threes, King fours, finding those Ace King, Ace Queens, whatever, right? That just 10 nines, 10 eights and so on. Yeah. Especially boards where people like to bet the flop and they didn't, it's mainly just because they have like a mid pair or something, not that they have delayed bluffs, but this is very, very general. This is tough to speak about multiple opponents. So I'm more looking at the spot when we delay bet, what we can do, what makes sense. And this year I call it a little, now we have two options. Where's the paint games back to those and opening the chat again. We can look into the past. This is here. Villain constructed his range already wrong. He cannot adjust. He sees the bet. He now knows, oh, fuck, I'm over folding. If he would look deeper, but he cannot react anymore because the mistake is done already. And the other thing is looking into the future and we can say, okay, he's probably not check he's probably not calling down enough we don't really know maybe people just make a decision oh this guy is crazy against him i'm calling so yeah cool i think that was what i had planned here so i actually like to do this protection betting a lot why not always bet pocket force it's really tough to counter that and to use sizings as you wish. I don't think you need to be as protected here. You can take your King Jack plus and bet big twice. You can protection bet like your 6X, anything you want. And yeah, let's go back to the slide. Lots of stuff open here. Example, explorative thoughts. Okay, double check on past and future. This was a little reminder for myself. And yeah, these are my main things. Adjust your sizings versus people who are not protected. The bigger, the better. Both bluffs and value. And adjust your bluffing or equity denial frequency versus people who are under bluffing. This is the logic that took me back like a couple of years back, quite some years back, some time to understand. Okay, those guys who are under bluffing this is the logic that took me back like a couple of years back quite some years back some time to understand okay those guys who are not bluffing themselves they end up with shit and you can just win air versus air right when it's air versus air the first bet is winning if he's not putting out the bet and you gave him the chance then it's your turn subano i can absolutely see that happening yes so subano says i do the 1bb delay a lot in tournaments and then level myself into calling the raises to then see nobody bluffs there they will re-bluff yeah so absolutely not okay cool let's wrap it up here a little uh still some time for for open questions if not i I'll leave you with a very, very easy key takeaways. Know your board type. I presented two. One of them was very, very easy. The other one is a little bit more nuanced with like two sizings on the turn, but two plans and one of them is the same like board type A. Know your turn bet sizings. So once you know your board type, you already know your turn bet sizings and then understand your structure, right? The big bet is the important one where we start on like equity driven. We know our value part and then we started with the bottom shit we are having. And then actually just like I can let you go and say life gets kind of easy and over bluffing is making money as long as villain did not show interest in the pot once he calls the big bet on the turn i would heavily say over bluffing is not working that much anymore but because we were just where we are mainly attacking him like not having anything for certain reasons that i tried to show and yeah sizings and all those plans are flexible, but the logic stays the same, especially for our tournament friends playing 40 big blinds deep. Obviously we are on average having smaller bet sizes, but yeah, and the logic stays the same as well for under the gun. Just the sizing points where we attack a little something are on average smaller, right? From under the gun, we don't need a big bet to attack the same hands because our range is so strong that villain is forced to fold anyways this is what you can learn in the add-ons that yeah the team will try to to put on the platform as soon as possible so i will this coaching will be here in like let's say 48 hours probably and then the the first add-on definitely next week to check that out i'll play a little versus GTO Wizard. I think I did surprisingly well for not being an expert in that spot. And usually I'm a big advocate for simplifying and betting small in those pools. Because obviously this is an exploit as well, versus players not check-raising enough. But still, we want to understand that. Okay. Yes, Subhan, very, very good point. I think for for tournaments it is quite important to understand that ranges are wider and equity of ace highs are higher so we can go wider for protection absolutely right your ace highs are very strong hands and low boards very very often after check check actually just equity now will get more important the big blind because of the empty is forced to defend way more. This is why actually you will put out lots of small bets on the flop, having a bigger range advantage compared to cash games where big blind stays kind of tight. But yeah, the logic still stays the same about denial of equity or pushing your equity and charging the long straws. Yeah, I hope you liked that one and you will see the add-ons as well I'm happy to see any kind of delayed bet posts of phantastries in discord or get a discussion going there and yeah see you in the next one
