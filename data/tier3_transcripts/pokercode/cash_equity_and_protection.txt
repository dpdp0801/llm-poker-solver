### TOPIC: cash equity and protection
 Hey Billa! Hey Taka, that looks good. Alright, I mean I don't have a Kahoot quiz today for the free coaching But still I try to ask lots of stuff. Hey Tsubano, we'll have a look at something like that today So we have some paint, we have some GTO wizard, we have obviously the presentation So I took quite some time this morning to prepare the show. Hey, secondhand, here we go. Harry, Jeroen, how are things in Malta? Hey Severino. For everyone, Jeroen is right now doing some kind of a private grind house So let's call it a grind trip in Malta. He wrote me. We'll see whether we can support them in any way Yeah playing like a bunch from like NL50 to NL200 cash with three guys. That sounds great I hope to read more of that in the discord channels. Hey mithal. I always have to call you Gouda I don't know why but it's like it's the metal Gouda for me So great to have you here and maybe some Greek followers. Sup sir, nice surprise or I've missed these streams lately There's not really a stream. It's the the poker code free coaching going on There's one every month that is not for members only so you can have a look at what we are doing here at poker code It's like a mix between Fedor hosting some, Matthias doing some and I'm doing some so today it's on me. Call me metal Okay, I go with metal. yeah i'm doing fine actually like now after my boy is born a little back into like normal schedule so actually you find me quite a lot on the tables whenever i find time i'm doing quite some coaching so i feel like kind of actually at the peak of my game right now again pretty confident in what i'm doing there so that being said i'll take a one week vacation to to visit friends and family next week and then i probably have to rework a little something but yeah big stealer here we go mr daddy great to have you here birdie how's whiskey doing whiskey is birdie's dog this is what like the mid and high stakes players are talking about right so it's cool sir muck five a lot greifschwein very nice okay so i think we're ready ready to go there will be some more popping in being a dad is great yeah it's like there's maybe some crying in the background but i think like it's about time that he fell asleep so all good all good okay so let's go as always i will start with a little overview what we are doing we're talking about equity and protection today so i thought for a while what i it's always tough for this like free coaching because i obviously want to present something that works for kind of everyone that wants to take a look at what's going on here and has some some good takeaways in the like regular coaching I hold one every two weeks we have more of kind of a red line not the one that is losing on the tables all the time for me but like more of a red line when it comes to topics that things fit together and make sense but yeah this year just fits for mtt players for cash for beginners as for high stakes players. So I think that covers it quite well. And it's one that I personally experienced to have lots of misconceptions about in the latest private coachings I was doing. So yeah, I decided to go for this topic and explain a little my view on things. I have no clue how long this one will take. It always feels like I didn't prepare. I mean, it took me some time, but I didn't prepare too much material. But let's see. And then probably after slide number three, we are like 90 minutes in. So we'll talk about what is actually equity and what is the problem with it, how the term is used. We'll talk about what actually protection is, how they belong together. And then I'll give lots of lots of examples before coming to the to the key takeaways. That's it. I try to keep an eye on the chat every now and then obviously there will be too much going on for me to follow but i will ask you some stuff or actually lots of stuff in the chat as well and i will read that stuff for sure so your chance to ask some stuff if it's topic related yeah let's just start why not right so five past three let's go yeah i want to start with a little story because this is always my example if someone had a private coaching with me already or was in one of a couple of the poker code coachings you might have heard that story already because this is the one that i always tell when it is about protection so actually the story needs to have a real story we need a face and we need a name so i don't have a face but you can imagine one this story actually happened in vegas on a live table it was a friend coming over to my table talking to my neighbor telling him a hand history and the hand history was the following that he told his buddy and it's just only the start of it like i wanted to interrupt them actually because it just like oh it was like felt weird what they talked about i don't remember the end of the story let's just say he got stacked but yeah the story is the following that hero in this story open raised let's say red kings on the cutoff and the button calls and on the flop let's say this is a 6.1 big blinds in the middle whatever that is and we are playing 100 big blinds deep that is important as well the board is queen 7-6 with a flush draw so lots of straight draws there a flush draw and this guy let's call him kyle from the us kyle taking taking rock for rock paper scissors this type of guy and he decides to bet 75% pot and his reasoning is he does it for protection So now this is the first question for the chat Where do I see the problem or am I wrong and Kyle just does a great job betting for protection here This is what I'm interested in. Just let me know. So just type it in I want to have at least like five answers ten answers Bela is saying drawing hands have too much equity to really protect with 75% sizing and realizing of equity is also higher in position Than for out of position you do it But it says the board changes not shift over time shift over certain runouts to big investments for protection protection Against what I like that subano protection against what so everything I read is right wrong size size. Better bet two times pot against ace four in green. Small would be better. Not folding hands that have good equity. The only protection we get is folding hands that have two or three outs. High equity draws. The draws you are protecting for are not folding, right? So you see, you get the point. Like this is everything that I tried to get out of here. It's just like, actually the question, what are you protecting against? So I'm always missing the against missing the against right if you cannot be precise with that you mess up stuff like that what you're doing is you're building a huge pot out of position against hands that either have you beat or that have very very good equity and playability or equity realization in position against you you bomb it against flush draws against straight draws you're pretty much setting up a really bad spot for you to play in a big pot out of position when the board changes and you don't have anything strong anymore on pretty much most runouts if the run out is deuce deuce good for you it's still not nutted what you have but yeah that's kind of it and what does protecting mean and you got it in the chat perfectly it's like protecting means kind of being safe of something and what are you safe of here it's like like yes villain folds pocket deuces without a spade. He folds pocket fours He folds ace three of clubs So all those hands have either like two or three outs against your hand Which is like another point that was great to read and important is like that's not okay for that price, right? If you bet small here and fold that out, we can find a reason for that. It's okay, right's okay right but here it's like yeah just imagine like i wanted to use the real story for the purpose of that story i should have went with like red aces because then actually we're not even having a benefit of folding out ace high anymore it's just folding up here so there's really no point in protection i don't get it right it doesn't make any sense and now we want to take a look at that today. That's our topics. The draws you're protecting are not folding for 70. Check raise maybe instead, right? Then maybe something is happening. Button is not folding anything interesting. Willan's not comfortable post flop. You want them to draw twice. So we could rephrase the whole story with some reads and then it would be fine. So first of all, let's have a look how this spot should be played in theory. All right. So I have some cash ranges here. I prepared that spot in GTO wizard. So yeah, cutoff versus a button flatting range. This is actually our flop play, right? Villain having just a way higher frequency of a set of sixes and sevens. So we have a big nut disadvantage. We have very bad equity realization on that drawy board out of position. And we have a clear range check here. And this is what we should do. If we bet big what is happening you told me already well the line is folding low peers and suited aces without the flush draw and maybe some Jack ten of hearts which well we have lots of equity against. We could run the numbers now and see that for a 75% pot price we kind of folded only out hands that have I don't know 15% equity at against us so yeah this is absolutely the point hero in this story absolutely messed up and misunderstood what protection means or just used it in the wrong way if he wants to play the hand like that because we are in vegas and we want to decide the bet size and everyone is shit he needs to tell the story differently he can say like okay i deviated from theory here because i want to get the maximum out of a queen and his flush draws because for example he never bluffs he never turns something into bluffs so i take my let's say 65 equity against a flush draw and i just build a pot and if the board gets ugly i just can't check fold because i know this guy is not bluffing so i get max against ace queen against queen jack against pocket eights against a random flush draw and yeah this way it can make sense maybe another line is still better but that would be fine but betting kings for protection here is just yeah straight up nonsense all right so yeah let's keep going that is the start for today and let's see first thing i want to talk about is what is actually equity what is that about i think from your answers i feel like everyone writing in the chat at least i know there are some people out there listening that are not like confident enough to write in the chat, just feel like there's no wrong answer or I won't give you shit for wrong answers. So better like that. It's like for those that answered, it seemed like it's pretty clear what we are talking about here. So it's like, I just gave you an example to have the brainstorm going a little. What is equity? You hear that a lot, like that I bet a hand because of equity. Like I continue with my flush draw because I have equity. Like I have good equity in this hand. I have this and that. I need to continue. My hand is too strong and so on. We're like, it's just such a term that is used way too often without being precise. And this is one of the major key takeaways of that coaching already is we want to be precise. And what do we have equity against? Let's have a look, right? If we have pocket queens here, we could say in general, we have good equity on that board. What we actually mean is that we have equity against let's have a look right if we have pocket queens here we could say in general we have good equity on that board what we actually mean is that we have very good equity against villains total range or maybe we mean that we have good equity against villains continuing range whatever the action is right if we just say like a random example like if we have queens and villain has kings we have very very bad equity we would actually have better equity just holding a flush draw or obviously holding the nut straight if villain has the nut straight we better have again the set or the flush draw and not the second best straight so it's like it's always important to know okay what do we have equity against and it's even more important when we are on the bluffing part when we are like having weaker hands it's still important to know okay what are we trying to draw to what do we beat do we actually have equity against hands that villain calls the flop with calls the turn with calls the river with or do we just have equity against his folding range how important is it for us to fold out the range he would fold now if we bet does he have equity against us so this is all the terms that are flying around there is important for me here but the main thing is to be precise the more precise you are better in the long run right it's like whenever i i rub your hands right i'm playing lots of tables as well and i mess up left and right so birdie can tell you in the chat and it's just like yeah i look it up and then like usually i understand okay what i did there didn't make sense because i was just clicking buttons whenever I play less tables maybe or I'm like really in my a game and I like or what I like doing for example recording a video for for poker code I'm talking while playing a lot and then once you start talking you start making reasons reasonings for every move you make and then once you speak out things loud it's like usually a way better thing you end up with doing already just because you get to be more precise and this is kind of the thing i want to start doing from now on for everyone is just that we say equity always needs reference points we cannot have equity we can have equity against something against the folding range against the calling range against the three times calling against the check raising range against the specific hand anything right so this is just the way we want to use that i have good equity against this call on range this might be something that we think about bluffing flop and turn because we might still improve and we know okay even if we like if we approve we still have like a value bet against his range maybe we only are doing okay against the check down range we try to bring that hand to showdown make our hand or just like have a hand in a way but we have no value that it's like it tells you whenever you say something like that more precisely it just tells you your actions that make sense a little more all right i'm just reading every now and then the chat do you still not bet the kings when you're only 25 big lines deep no it's a totally different spot my equity realization is way better i can close the action on the turn pretty much by overbet jamming something like that so absolutely totally different spot for 25 picks we can we can bet a lot there all right so let's keep going it's like always i made that presentation once and i have no clue what's up next that's kind of a pattern in my coaching so we all will be surprised together what's next and okay let's see so coming to that i teased like that in the poker code channel that we will see how i put donald trumpzerian and Bob the Builder into that coaching. And now instead of looking at equities, we want to look at protection, what it actually means. Now let's first go with the literal sense, not in the poker world. In the poker world, what does protection mean actually? So protection mean that like you are safe in case something happens, I would say, or you make sure cannot happen right it's like well as bob the builder obviously on your construction site there can be something falling down hitting your head like it will still happen but because you wear his freaking helmet it won't hurt you that's like what is protection right dan bilzerian is like kind of the american thing here he's probably protecting his family this is why why he need a couple of weapons Well, maybe he does or does not do a good job protecting them having this kind of stuff But I like it's I needed to use that picture like Donald Trump obviously builds a great wall there I don't know what he's actually protecting against by building that wall Maybe he's just a little over protecting in the poker sense But it's kind of like a massive massive protection you could go for or we have that that little cute kid there where it's like actually just protecting against some rain where maybe you feel it right away i tried to be a little more precise with protection here all those four people are protecting themselves in a way we can argue about one or two of them but they are in like in their minds they are protecting themselves in a way but by speaking out out what they are protecting against. Or knowing what they are trying to protect against. It tells you which tools they need. And well this is the same in the poker world right. So it's like sometimes you just want to protect against a little rain that might be coming right. It's not going to kill you. And if you miss wearing that little cute Pikachu suit you'll be all right. If you don't wear the helmet as Bob the Builder you might be in serious trouble. And well, I don't know whether Dan Bilzerian's family gets killed if he doesn't have those weapons, but you never know. And let's not talk about our friend Donald here. So I didn't talk about him as a poker player. No, I guess he can't play poker. So now this is something to keep in mind, right? And this should transfer over quite well to poker. But I still thought like, okay, what i did was actually poker plus protection was what i put in into google i first got to a german poker school i didn't well present that german text to you so the second page good on that search engine optimization is upswing poker so shout out to our friends from upswing and this is what i found here a protection bet is a bet made with a strong yet vulnerable hand that forces other players who are on draws to either call with unfavorable pot odds or fold. So think about that. First thing we need to have the chance to make a protection bet. We need a strong yet a vulnerable hand. And the second thing is villain needs to have a draw that then either we don't care about the result, it's either folding or it's calling with unfavorable pot odds both options are kind of good for us this is how protection bet is defined here and then they follow up with i think a very good example you hold pocket nines and the flop comes eight six twos you might put out a protection bet to prevent other players from hitting outs what i like here is that it's outs in general and not draws in like the the sense it's like talked about in like the world out there so it's not about flushes and straights only we talk about over cards as well on later streets here i think this is a sport where we could go back to our cutoff versus button example maybe then pocket 900 big blind steve don't want to do too much betting on eight six deuce out of position maybe it's more an in position thing because then you can react to the runouts without like blowing a pot up first and then acting out of position later but what i'd like my statement towards that is just like it's definitely not wrong and it's a great example if we maybe are a little more precise and say like this is button versus big blind for example but it's just very very specific right we need to have a cup like lots of given things and i'm pretty sure that we need more kinds of protections just going back i think like they are saying something like they are describing one of those cases here i don't know which one to compare but just like one of them right you have a strong but vulnerable hand and we are playing versus the draw so we want to make sure they are either overcharged or they just fold both is good for us that makes sense but they are not talking about that little kid here maybe they're not talking about bob the builder it's just they took one example where it makes sense but actually there's way more than that in the poker world and there's way more general spots where we can use the concept of protection whatever it still means we didn't talk about it really right we talked about equity we've learned that it makes sense to always talk about the against what do we have equity against what do we want to protect against this is nice here this is precise protect against from hitting outs like overcards flushes and straights on later streets it's like the word charging is not really in there but it's in there because they call with unfavorable products i like the word charging as well so this is the first things that i like here i think this is too special and not really covering the word protection bet but it's definitely a correct thing It's a duck suit.'s a duck suit you win i it's it's a duck suit okay that's it all right always a helmet well so we have fear he cuts you the duck okay it's a duck actually i thought about putting a picture of condoms in there as well for protection i googled for it but i didn't find fancy cool ones the first google page so not protection betting protecting means that they would need to fold sometimes they will never fold a flush draw here right but like this is why i like that explanation for that one here we are not really protecting in the sense that they fold but we are overcharging them in a spot where we have let's say 60 equity against the flush draw plus over card something like that which is still favorable for us protection against getting bluffed on the next street would be more about equity realization over Over realization that's going a little deeper. That stuck out not by. But you can still find whether there's a pikachu one as well. Okay so let's dig a little deeper. So now this is now my comments first of all. Try to be as precise as possible. What are you protecting against? Is it just some rain? Is it someone trying to steal your wallet? Like something that is not cool but like not the end of the world a very unlikely outcome like something in real life we try to be to protect against this just like having an insurance right just like you smash someone's car i don't know and like five people die and you cannot come up for that like a very very unlikely outcome but like then someone else covers it and you only pay like a small fee so some kind of insurance like that might be a poker thing as well where is it like a massive thing like someone wants to try and kill you and you need to like really need massive massive massive protection and just like over jam like 500 big blinds there who knows right so just be precise what are you protecting against helps you so much we could go back to the example it's a stretch to say we know how people react right because everyone can play as he wishes to but we have some experiences playing and i would say if we bet big here we are not really protecting against flush draws but we are definitely protecting against overcards i don't expect someone to call king jack of hearts here on the flop so if i bet big here and the turn is jack yes people can have the jack of spades but i'm way safer now because i put out that let's call it protection bet on the flop so just to know okay we are protecting against that the other part we are maybe charging not really protecting whatever that means all right so protection next thing and what i did here is just being clear about what i'm doing right for me that is important i split it up into two parts the first part is denying equity and then it's a pretty clear definition. We are only freaking protected if villain falls, right? We make sure stuff cannot happen. We build a wall, no one can come in. That's kind of the thing, right? So we are only protected if villain falls. So I prefer the wording of denying equity. It's just like the word deny tells you, okay, he's like the equity share he had is out, right? For a certain price we are putting out there there so it's really whenever we talk about folding something out it's for me not a protection bet it's really denying his equity and now this comes to the next point referring back to the upswing example it's for that we don't need a strong yet vulnerable hand to use their words it's whenever something happens when we have a freaking fourth pier and we fold out two over cards to that that's's great, right? That's a protection bet. Let's say we call a three bet with pocket threes. The board is like 8-8-7. Furnace deuce. Don't checks to us. I wouldn't say we have a strong yet vulnerable hand. Still, this is a mandatory bet to fold out his king jack of diamonds give ups or get like charge, right? It's like charging his draw. This will be the next one that is like his ace king. It's of a protection value bet there's always lots of mixes like there's not one name for a certain bet it's always a mix but we want to know what we are doing here and this is important that we can protect or in my words now we can deny equity in the protection sense that we don't need a very strong hand to do so so now the next thing is depending on the equity we need to deny we have different useful bet size. To fold out some stuff depends a lot on our overall range, how villain's parts do against our value range maybe as well, but by just naming things we know already which sizings make sense, right? If we want to deny equity from one hand that has maybe one overcard to the board, a small size might be enough. Something like deny equity from a hand that has two overcards let's say we have a board like three three deuce and villain has something like jack ten that we want to deny equity of it's like maybe we need a slightly bigger bet size something like that but if we state what we are trying to do we know exactly what's going on so i'll read the chat a little here so we put out a bet with pocket threes it is protection if he folds king jack it is value if he stupidly calls his king jack well it's like we are protecting in a way like that we don't care we don't care that's a good thing he either makes a bad call or he makes a good fold like both options are good for us it's like in that way we are protecting ourselves it's in that way a protection that if he hits his hand he paid the price for it right often enough he won't hit his hand he's six outs he's paying a price for it that is not okay for that if he folds we kill his 12 equity share he has and if he calls he paid accordingly or he overpaid for what he has so that's both good for us and in a way protection right but it's like the word denying equity is meaning that i expect him to fold in a way all right so there is this is for myself that i i wrote down example here i want to make one example here this is very casual let's just do that i raised the button and the big blind calls and we get a board my example was what was it king king deuce that's a board where we need a hell of protection i would say i just imagine we have ace deuce or pocket threes now right villain is obviously checking range to us and well what a surprise we want to bet every hand we are having and we want to bet well every hand rather smallish right because that is enough if villain has lots of random high cards 10-8 whatever but like the the value against our overall range he's drawing that to a king he's drawing that to our pocket queens with lots of those hands and this is a large bunch of hands that i can attack obviously he is drawing like strong like having 25 equity or so against our pocket threes or deuce but he doesn't know what we have so that's the beautiful part here that if we bet small we deny equity from all those hands and now this is important we are not making them just fold there is certain equity that we deny right so i could i'll put that in here then we say okay we have a board of king of clubs king of spades deuce like suits shouldn't matter and we have pocket threes let's say and let's just remember this here we have this offsuit trash stuff and that suited trash stuff that is folded but this year is important to me it's like again sorry that this is so small but this will be okay for that case here it's like okay i put just like those hands in here that are folds some kind of that actually what we did is we did fold out like 30 equity for a very tiny size of like a large chunk of villain's hands this is a major major major success and an absolutely mandatory protection bet to deny equity now obviously villain is calling with hands that we have 70 equity against calling his ace 10 highs that's good as well but it's like i want to use the wording for the expectation of them to fold or to call in other spots right it's we will see that as well it's like it doesn't make any sense to fold that out because villain is not drawing to anything cool right folding out hands that have pretty much no equity is not a success we pay a price to achieve actually nothing just to win the hand now instead of later so this is something where the people often misinterpret where like spots they like betting small when it actually doesn't accomplish anything because it doesn't really have equity in those spots but this year is the best example or a very good example there's maybe a better one i don't know where just denying equities is so gold all right so cool let's let's keep going a little what's next that was the king king deuce i wanted to show this year how much equity we actually fall out and this should lead us to part number two charging drops Right. So this is the other part if we cannot make villain fold still, I don't know how villain plays This is just my expectations, right? Obviously if villain folds a flush draw to a very tiny size I'm happy about it, right? But it's like our expectations if we cannot make villain fold we can build a pot while we have equity advantage and a favorable future game that's kind of an important part while with the pocket kings example we had in the chat there as well that people say it's a clear value bet but is it really it is against villains queen x that then hopefully checks back but actually we build a pot that then we have two more streets to play in a spot where we actually have the disadvantage so we are building a pot to then play a spot the hand is not over so here the in position out of position plays a big role and charging draws is usually very much an in position thing because then we see whether the draw gets there we can check back safely and got max value and if well the draw doesn't get there we probably still have a value bet so right it's like what happens here is we don't fold things out but we force villain to pay a price right let's just say here's like 30 in the middle and right now given his equity like villain should get like 10 of those that's more or less like we should charge him that this number gets like back to even doesn't mean we should bet like 10 it's just like we should find a way to make him somewhat indifferent or to make a large chunk of his range indifferent that is always the goal to give villain two options that both are this is the best thing that can happen right so we price him in with weaker hands we know exactly what he calls and the price we should choose depends on the quality of villains draw again i have a pretty clear example here so how does position affect betting to deny equity it's a little about the future game as well. The Great Denton, a good question. It's just we need usually bigger sizes out of position, slightly bigger sizes, right? Let's say maybe a quarter bet is sufficient in position. We need maybe a third pot out of position, but it's not in position, out of position. It's the future game where the positional advantage just plays a role, right? So you can float more in position because your next treats will play a little better and yeah that's kind of the thing. This is everything related Leon poker. This is about protection and equity and we have that in tournaments and cash games. I will use cash game examples though but you can transfer lots of stuff. Just see it as 100 PB poker. Some things will be different for shorter stacks poker but the main logic is the same. Alright so now coming to the example where i'm charging draws so we open and raise the button again the big blind defends again and this time we get a different board just change actually one card you make the board ace king deuce so now what happens here is big blind checks to us again as he should we see that here and then it's our turn and all of a sudden we have very very different sizing right we could use the small bet and villain folds But actually if you think about all our value hands if villain folds then he had pretty much 0% equity, right? If we bet a king or an ace and villain folds 10-6, it's not a success Like he just fold like we forced him to play perfectly Lots of people still like playing the small bet here because you win the pot often, but it's not really yeah They are just a little scared of playing the delayed game tree so what we want to do here is well first of all getting value because we have a massive advantage on that board but choosing the sizing we see one clear pattern right the main size that is chosen here maybe this is interesting for all the people that did the cash game quiz already so like i designed a cash game quiz for those that haven't seen it you find it on poker code this is one of the questions i think the board is ace king four if you keep that in mind here you will have the first answer correct and yeah we are choosing this large size the flop over bet first of all it's super cool to do it secondly it has a clear effect villain has draws we have the massive advantage we are the only ones having ace king aces and kings here in that spot so we are trying to find a way to keep that advantage what is the worst thing that? What is the worst thing chat? What is the worst cards we can actually get here on the turn? Leon poker Queen Jack Tucker Queen Jack 10 3 of diamonds Alec poker Maybe in anti games when they defend 4 or 5 off like in my games or 5 office and not a defend 4 or 5 suited Is mainly 3 bad so we don't care about the 3 too much straight Queen Jack 10 Queen 10 All right, so you're on the right track I don't know whether it's evy wise the worst thing but just like when we think about the advantage it's like yes we have that stuff ourself but right now we have a great spot where we have nuts villain doesn't if there's a queen jack or 10 then yeah he has offsuit straights that's a lot right so this is exactly why we are choosing that sizing right i think it's not a coincidence a coincidence. If we choose that 125% pot sizing, look at Villain's reaction. What we just did is making exactly those hands indifferent, right? All this shit, we don't care about that. This is like those hands do not exist. They have zero equity, zero EV, no nothing in that spot. So we are trying to target something. And this is exactly that here. All offsuit, like sometimes maybe a three bet preflop. People people don't do that so it's pretty much like 36 combinations of offsuit queen jack and queen 10 that we attack here we make them indifferent all right so this is the first thing like i don't know whether it's like denying equity or charging draws i would more call it charging draws because i expect them to call mainly but it's kind of yeah the goal to make them indifferent it's more the wording i try to say like what am i protecting against here i'm not protecting like against the freaking him hitting a two pair it's like whatever but this is what i can tackle like this is 36 combinations offsuit some suited that is added that is what i can attack so i need a certain big sizing to fuck him up that is my goal and then well if the turn is a freaking five he just paid 6. big blinds to not see anything, right? Or he folds and then, well, even if the turn is a queen, jack or 10, I still have the nuts every time. So it's like, whatever he does, it's shit. So we gained something here. So in reality, villain is not even calling queen, jack, jack, 10 versus overbet. Then our realities are different. This is obviously, right? Once we have like reads and we can make adjustments and choose different sizes. But sizes but yeah even better you can bet big and then you like every queen jack 10 for you is a brick that's great we don't necessarily need to make him call he just misses a plus EV or a zero EV call the good thing is that you can go crazy on a queen jack 10 still don't need to be bothered by those hands villain sits on ace-x only perfect alright so that was the second example more regarding draws oh this is a long thing the second hand us so we give us options based on our range and how much villain is protected now this lecture is about to select the correct hand in the options you give yourself i don't understand the question this question is about like the difference of like whenever we talk about protection this is more about like finding the the other reference point what are we playing against what are we protecting against what does protection mean do we expect villain to fall do we expect him to call to having a plan and then being more precise with bet sizes right if you just hold out something that has one over card you go for a small bet size if you want to charge and not gut shot you probably go something bigger and what about a hand like pocket sevens if you get hand protection like queen nine by short betting? There that's absolutely correct. Obviously queen nine has equity against you but we are talking about two very very low EV hands right. So it's like queen nine even when it hits it cannot value bet or anything. It's actually still an indifferent hand against any bets. So this is a very very low EV stuff which makes protecting pretty irrelevant right because every bet you put out there you obviously invest with your sevens into king x and ace x so there is always a trade-off how much it is worth for you to protect when pocket three is on king king deuce again villain hits his 10 on the turn with 10 8 or let's stick to the queen 9 hits a 9 he has a nice value bet at some point right so this is like worth way more hitting that hand and protecting against that hand if like he's like yes he can beat us at some point but it's not like he makes a hand or anything okay so how do equity and protection belong together you already have a clue i guess that it's always about the what are we playing against right so often this is just a mix as we have just seen that queen jack queen 10 jack 10 it's more about what are we attacking than really knowing what they call or what they fold but in lots of spots spots we just know whether they call or fold, right? So now I wanna do quickly some paint games with you, like some guessing for the chat, and then I show you some more examples out of the real world, how I see that and how I put that into perspective. Yeah, dragon, don, eevee, it's a very close thing. I understand the point, but it's just, if we play high stakes, this is just, it's actually better hand to call with than like your your mid pair King something like that okay so let us go to the paint games and now what I do when I talk about draws and equity denial and protection I build something like this here I talk about two kinds of draws because I make a massive difference between those as I make a massive difference between charging draws and denying equity. So some who have seen some of my videos have already seen something like that in a different way where I sort some boards, right? So this is mainly about us using a big bet or a small bet, right? So like 10 years ago, we talked about dry and wet boards, which means on wet boards, there are lots of draws. Draws actually only meaning flush draws and straight draws and dry boards just meaning everything that is like doesn't have that. Like ace king deuce was a dry board and seven seven deuce was a dry board but queen ten seven with a flush draw was a wet board and four five six with the flush draw was a wet board. So it's kind of i didn't like that because it's only like from wet to dry not making a difference but here it's still split it up into charging draws and denying equity so the wet and dry that people talked about is more the charge draws here now how many straight draws are there think about mainly offsuit combos for a villain how many freaking flush draws are there that we can't charge and the other thing is more about overcards need to deny If I have pocket threes and it has some value, well I need to get rid of like random overcards. This is something where we have seen the king king deuce, we need a freaking 100% bet here. And now I want to go through those boards, six example boards, and I want to ask you where you would put them in this graph. So we had the ace king four, we didn't have it with a flush draw, we had ace king deuce rainbow Where we have already seen there's absolutely no need to deny equity The board is in that way regarding over cards is locked up with us having all kinds of ace x king x, right? So it's like again the same thing with the for our sevens It's bad when he hits his queen with the queen nine But for our king, it's good because he maybe pays like a half pot bet or so So it's just shifting the range part are having that gets the EV. We don't need to protect because villain is not really improving to anything. So this board I would say we definitely need to charge draws. Regarding the offsuit broadway draws this was already here and now we added a flush draw so this is a board that doesn't need to deny any equity so it's really on the top here but it needs the maximum to charge draws. I only put in the numbers here to help you find something for the chat and now I'll just read the chat and then I want you to guess where the next boards belong. What about the term locked equity boards instead of dry wet? You can use any terms I just want to make the difference between well denying equity hence that we need to fold out usually tells us how high our frequency is and the need to charge draws tells us that we need the big bet all right so nope smart players understand it but they know okay okay okay there's lots of stuff going on let's go for the jack deuce deuce i want to know you uh i want to yeah i want to ask like where does that belong the jack deuce deuce how much equity do we need to deny how much need to charge draws just put in a number put in a number for the chat here fc1711 a couple of fours once so we are oops no we are here we all agree that we are like in that area right so we definitely don't need to charge draws i guess this is a very clear one second thing is how important is it to deny equity how important is it if we have a jack well kind of important we have like a queen king ace high frequency cards in villains range that we need to like either charge or deny equity against so i would say it's not the one it's definitely not the one it has to be the Thank you. We have like a queen king ace high frequency cards in villains range that we need to like either charge or deny equity against So I would say it's not the one it's definitely not the one It has to be the four or the seven and then like our peers like threes fours fives They obviously want to get rid of like the one over card hands to a jack or just even the two under card hands to Jack like a ten eight ten seven very favorable So we see seven seven four four I agree like a seven deuce deuce would be more here Maybe right more over cards more important to fold out ten nine. Let's put it here Thank you. 10-8, 10-7, very favorable. So we see 7-7, 4-4. I agree. Like a 7-deuce-deuce would be more here maybe, right? More overcards, more important to fold out 10-9. Let's put it here. That seems reasonable, I guess, right? So this way we have a first plan. All right, king 10-8 as the next one. You can put in comma numbers as well. So it's tough to be like, if you tell me it's like between a deuce and a 5, you need to find a way. Then it's like a 25, right? So if it's between 2 and 5, it's like a 25. If it between like four or five you make it 4.5 so the king 10 8 2.5 that would be 2.5 would be here six here so it's best case is there is obviously no right or wrong it's not scientific but it should fit relatively to the other boards we have already right so i think this is very clear that this has to be on the right side of the jack deuce deuce it has to be on the top of the jack deuce deuce right less important is only ace high as the only over card there's obviously massive draws and hmm is there maybe even more draws going on than on the ace king four who knows we have another six six six six six 69 so i think like i would rule out the last one here we don't need to deny lots of equity like hence that snap fold is like getting rid of a jack-5 of clubs Is that important? I don't think so. Is it important to get rid of like an ace high? That's maybe the only thing so I would say it's like somewhere here 6-3 somewhere here Maybe even push it a little to the right. So yeah, definitely because of the ace high we want to deny equity against it's more to the bottom than this and on the scale Right or left I think depends depends depends where the villain has ace queen and ace jack But I think like make it like this So i'm fine with the 36 guys people that put in 36 they get my winner a six and a three is is somewhat good Somewhere between three and six so this is clear three so we need to move ace king forward to 2.5 That's a good that's a good point, right? So let's actually make that a little more here. And this year, I wouldn't say it's a clear three because still folding out ace high Which villain has very high frequency all the haze ace highs in the big blind So it's maybe a little more like a not a 36 but like something here. I'm fine with that I hope you are too. All right, let's go for the next one King Queen deuce rainbow So Bano asked whether there's a pattern whether we have the draws ourselves like King ten eight We have all nut draws, but out of position could have more Jack 9 off I think we have all Jack 9 off if you talk about the button 9-6 suited depends that we cover like in that spot big blind has the wider range as well It matters when we get to lower boards where villain actually has stuff that we don't have then we rule out the big bet because this gives villain a reason to check raise a lot and then it's a dominating strategy for us to bet small even with our strong hands because we let villain check raise instead so king queen deuce we get a five two five two so somewhere here in the middle one two here okay this area five eight okay i don't understand the eight where that is coming from five two five two five two five two so we are saying there are some offsuit draws. Cool. And we are saying there's like a medium, smallish need to deny equity, right? Again, just the ace highs. So it's like the king 10, 8. Like on that scale, the need to deny equity, it's like it should be actually less than the king 10, right? Like on the king 10, it's slightly important to hold out a random jack. On the king queen deuce, it's not important at all. So actually, this might be somewhere here. And we again shift things that little down right maybe something like that all right so i think this is fine this is fine let's go two more to go three deuce deuce easy one easy one seven that's a freaking seven eight charging a lot of backdoor draws here too okay seven seven seven super seven seven eight okay go here so we definitely have a bigger need to deny equity than on the jack deuce deuce clear it has to be below that one and then need to charge draws i understand what you mean that's the question how we define it here how we understand it i would say on jack deuce deuce we attack something like 10-8 this might be a hand that is drawing that to a jack like here every hand is like, okay He might be drawing that to our over pairs, but that's about it Right, so it's like we need to attack another kind of hand, but it's still we attack his random cards But they are more like two over cards to the board all the time It's like attacking King Queen on Jack deuce deuce all the time something like that So I would say on three deuce deuce, maybe we need slightly bigger bet sizes Right so to get that effect right whether you call those a need to charge draws or not. That's a definition case, right? Thank you. like that. So I would say on three deuce-deuce, maybe we need slightly bigger bet sizes, right? So to get that effect, right? Whether you call those a need to charge draws or not, that's a definition case, right? So I put it here, but maybe I want to look that up. This is just an idea that it makes sense that we need a slightly bigger size to deny this equity of like something like jack 10. So let's have a look. We open raise the button, big blind calls, and our board here, the first one was jack deuce-deuce rainbow. And a mix of where is it button high betting frequency right and a small one like 43 small 21 medium half pot right so let's compare that to the three deuce deuce i slightly expect that the half pot goes up in frequency now because this is exactly like let's see the difference if we bet 1.8 always look at the offsuit part. Villain is continuing all that shit and only folding the real trash right against the half pot Villain starts folding more here on the ace high the king high is a little more like the the one over plus a little backdoor straight this is what we are attacking always interesting to see what we are attacking so if you look at the three deuce deuce remember we had 40% small bet and we had 20% medium bet So now I expect a little more medium bet and it's like only 21% small bet 24% let's say medium bet and even some bigger bet like in the first hands going for the bigger bet are the ones needing the most Protection I would guess like pocket fives pocket sixes pocket sevens something like that a three makes a lot of sense But this is how I would shift it obviously there's still no real need to charge like real draws in that wet or dry sense of boards here why there's less betting frequency overall it's just because we are just doing not as good on the board the incentive to deny equity is still there and it's still higher than on jack deuce deuce just well we are doing well on jack high boards but on three deuce deuce we are not just not having much ourselves this explains that we cannot choose from like infinite value hands that we are having so we need to go hand in hand with our value part this is why the checking frequency is higher on that board would like to know the bet large distribution across one and nine this is not scientific this is just an idea in our head and if you double check it will be correct quite often actually So this is maybe for some homework for some really interested people put it into GTO wizard put out the numbers here This would be too much. It's going too far here. But yeah, okay last one who wants to try the last one Where do we put the last one eight six four rainbow here? We are just talking about the need about the incentive, right? It's not that this means we are betting big or small all the time. You want to understand the incentives we're having. Nine, nine. All right, everyone is a little shy to go for the 8-6-4, not our favorite board. Nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine. Eight, eight. All right, so lots of eight and nine. So I think it's definitely high. Like it has to be on the up-down scale. It has to be between jack-deuce-deuce and three-deuce-deuce, I guess, just because it's eight high. On the draw, it doesn it doesn't have a flush draw so if we add a flush draw it would go further to the right it has the straight draws so i think like somewhere here is reasonable and now when we take that graph and try to make something like a bet sizing plan out of it we need to understand incentives right here we would love to charge draws it just doesn't make sense for our hands because if we have a hand like pocket six is one of charge draws still we need to understand villain does better on that board on most runouts it's better for the big blind so he will take over initiative and we are more the guy reacting which means we are betting small and villain will check raise mainly and this is how we get the money in the middle all right all right but like i hope you got that point like trying to understand what the difference is between denying equity we expect villain to fold we want to make him fold and the need to charge draws what we do here and for those sports where we actually have an advantage it tells us right away which bet sizings make sense okay so this was just a little paint game for you guys to have an idea how i'm thinking there how you can think in game and now we have a couple of examples i took out of the real world i mean i won't pull out hands i played now would take me too long but I remember some of those hands. I will do it in a GTO wizard because it's just the most convenient way. But I want to show you some ways of protection bets that can maybe fit to some of our examples from real life or can just make a lot of sense and is maybe something you didn't even think about so far. We have seen the small range bet on king king deuce. We have seen the large protection charging draws bet on ace king four all right so now the next one is actually a four bet pot and let's go with the hijack we open raise the hijack cut off three bets hijack four bets cut off calls we are playing a four bet pot think about villains range now this is what the we are the hijack and this year is what cutoff is calling suit broadways here's that's it all all right cut off calls and we get another great flop ace king deuce can someone tell me which protection bet i'm showing you guys now what is a bet size we love on that board for that pot middle position versus cut off these are the given ranges whether real players play like that or not doesn't matter for now this is the solver output what is the that size we want to use here and why do i call it a protection bet small 25 10 15 10 25 33 very small to protect against sets all right small bet bet 25 10 10 all right let's have a look and we see we have 39.5 big lines in the middle we see a 52 percent bet a betting frequency of 10 percent right and like another 26 of 25 percent those are attacking different parts of villains range i lately this is where this hand is actually coming from had a coaching with someone who checked here who checked with ace queen like he's like okay yeah i mean i have kind of a nutted hand but what is villain paying me with whatever and there's a massive punt here right if we look at the ev it's it will be a massive difference like this is i mean not a massive one but it's like just checking is clearly worse than the other options and the main reason is to give villain a freaking free card right so we can do the math ourselves let's say we have ace queen right i don't run the whole spot now range versus range but let's say we have ace queen here and the thing is what happens villain has jacks tens nines eights and sevens so he has two outs to hit the turn if it goes check check this is the major problem right so he has two outs and we know our ace queen his pocket pier this is four cards we know three cards on the flop that we know that's a seven total we have 52 cards in the deck so there are 45 cards left two out of them helped him so he has actually 4.4 equity to hit a set on the turn right so this is our major major problem this is the free card we're giving him so now we have two options we give it that to him for free and let's say we will stack off with our ace queen anyways so he will win a 200 big blind pot or let's say this 40 plus another 80 that we will invest he will for 4.4% he will win 120 big blinds that sucks let's like 5 we are giving him right here. All right and this is oddly like not exactly that number but it fits quite well right. So now what happens if he doesn't hit 96% of the time or like 95.5% he will pay us 3.95. So this is kind of what we charge him for that. It's like in this theory it's not enough but obviously we are not always stacking off because we don't have always ace queen and actually what we do as well is hey we make him indifferent with those hands that actually benefit from him hitting a set as well. So aces kings are actually interested in keeping his pocket eights in there. So this is where it gets really important to understand what are we protecting against. That's kind of my insurance case. It's something it's very very unlikely that it happens right two out of 45 cards doesn't happen too often but in case it happens i want to have my insurance or this is kind of right i let him pay like a monthly thing like 3.95 i'll let him pay and then once every two years he gets his payoff right and this evens out in the way but i don't give him this freaking free card right so we can have a look at the reaction 3.95 and this is what we achieve pocket nines pocket eights he doesn't care like zero eb right this is how it works here free card never yeah right right it's just like 10 years ago there was like he only has two outs so we don't need to deny equity which obviously is not true we just need to adjust our bet size to his equity right so it's like i don't only only know like the german saying it's like obviously it doesn't make sense to take our freaking pocket kings and blast it here right this year then he has an easy reaction it's like it would be with like with canonen auf spatzen schießen i don't know what like maybe someone can translate that it's just like doing too much for what we try to achieve this would be more like making sure an ace pays the most now but here this is the the sizing we want to find so this would be one of out of the real life example i use a lot overkill in translation absolutely so we can see our second plus we can see our everything we can keep things shooting on birds with cannons yeah okay i don't know oracle yeah overkill actually yeah okay so cool this was like let's say protect like the little let's call it the pikachu child right protecting against something that doesn't hurt too much giving a free card to something that has two outs the little rain out there but it's still better it feels better right to get there dry to the turn all right right i like that we want to make villain buke right is the german in in the chat here all right so let's get to another thing and i'm pretty sure chat does really well today we play another another four bet pot. This time we open raise the button. Villain three bets the small bind. We four bet. And the small bind calls. So again, we see Villain's small bind calling range suited broadways. Some aces traps, mainly ace queen offsuit. Hits jack, hits a ten. King, queen, ace queen, ace jack. Eight, seven, sixes. Some tens, some jacks, and so on. So small bind calls. Sorry, that was our four betting rangeting range, right? That was the calling range, sorry. So, and the flop is jack of hearts, 10 of spades, 4 of spades. Oh, this is out of position, so I don't need to hide it. So, Villain will check 100% to us. What is the protection bet I'm looking for now? So in 4-bet pot, do we mind queen-jack-10 turn on ace-king-deuce? If the ranges are as they should be, he doesn't have jack-10, queen-10 ever. So, we don't care. It's about the sets that he can have or not so let's let's ask for the protection bet we want to use here so shove all in 50 charging draws with all in screwed this up in the quiz today nice so the quiz answer is 25 and all in small we are still behind jacks and tents yeah but we have to like if we have something we have to we have to stack off against jacks and tents like he doesn't have it that often in those ranges here right you see how often he has jackson tents and how often he has all the other stuff maybe in reality it's sometimes a little different because people only have jackson tents but this year is the theory we're playing against this range you should be sizing up here all in all in jam good old 30 percent all in all in all in so what is the first hand you want to go for max protection with? Give me one hand. Is there a way to adjust the four-bet size in GTO wizard? Unfortunately not Yeah, we see lots of mamacitas in the chat lots of mamacitas So this is a clip just like shout out to Pat's to all his stories and the mamacitas So queens and ace jack, right? So I would say it's definitely Queens. They need the max protection But yeah, let's have a look what happened, right? And this is now again where well someone is trying to rob us this board every turn card is bad for our freaking Queens So they try to get it in now, right? It's about what are we attacking and how much equity does that have? Willna has like something like a 10x with backdoor flush draw. Willna has something like a jack and now here's the other part of the story We have lots of hands that just cannot bet fold with ace queen ace king king queen it's two over cards plus an open ender or plus a gut shot plus potentially backdoor flush draw this is our problem right the 50 bet sizes i understand the idea but if we bet 50 tell me which hand you want to bet fold you cannot bet fold as king yes you can bet fold ace nine of clubs but it's then 50 the best sizing you want to use right so here it's just all the hands have so much equity, so we need to get them in the middle. And the hands that benefit from it is queens and ace jack benefit the most. Getting it in right here. So this would be the freaking max protection all in. And then we build something hands that do not need as much protection, like super nuts. We do the small stuff again, right? We bet not tiny, but like 25%. Then villain is indifferent with all kinds all kinds of i mean he has to jam a lot but he needs to continue with whatever a 10-8 that is drawing that he needs to continue maybe even with some of the pocket pairs so this is this is what we try to achieve here but being aware of that spot that just freaking jamming in spots like that can be pretty cool ace king hearts is all in can you check seems like a fine idea i would say check button. I mean all the ace-kings here, right? It's like I can show you okay What happens if oh did I dunk here? Sorry. No, I messed up here. I messed up the thing What happens if we bet where was it quarter? This is villains continuation. This is why we do that with Jack So I kind of messed up and now why do we do that is kind of the max charge What are we trying to attack? We bet all in what happens. Look at this here. All of villains freaking flush draw. We have ace king and make ace five of spades call. We are actually ahead of that. There is no sizing we can use to make them fold. But yeah, it's like we max charge them instead, right? And if we have ace king, we actually deny equity of pocket eights, which is a hell lot of equity, right? So this is we just achieve a couple of good things happening so this is what leads to that bet size what holding do we not mind giving him a cheap card well if we have super shit and if we have super nuts i think you really like simplifying it do you think there is really evian splitting up ranges in these spots it's up in this spot it's absolutely mandatory to have that all in and it's not the main thing right all in is 44 percent the small bet is the other part right pocket jacks pocket tens kings and aces don't have the over cards against them so yeah i think it's absolute crucial here in that spot all right so this was another real life example i think i have two more all right that that fits timing fits pretty pretty well today so another one let's get go to a sing race pot again button versus big blind and let's take a board an ace-king-four, this time I made a flush draw out of it and yeah we obviously started with our flop overbet. Right again, flush draw or not, lots of overbetting going on. So villain decides to call, so what does he have? He has ace-x, he has king-x with backdoor, folding already the ones without backdoor, and he has like some of the gut shots here. Well those with backdoor, and four-x with backdoor backdoor flush draw and all the flush draw so now when the turn is kind of a special card like a double flush draw card it's now what's what's happening now right so what's happening now chad what are we doing jam wow now i like where this is going okay this is freaking wild to jam like five times pot but betting big got a size down down, interesting. Why you want to size down? Over bet 150, keep big betting, sizing down, big betting. All the guys sizing down, why do you want to size down? Don't worry Robbie, I like the caps actually. Villain range is stronger, where is it stronger? No more protection needed, what? Right, it's like there's, we are just talking about charging draws here. Just talking about charging draws. Villain sits on ace, X of hearts. Villain sits on king, X of spades. Villain sits on four, X of spades. draws villain sits on ace x of hearts villains it's on king x of spades villain sits on four x of spades and villains it's off on nine x of hearts that's like infinite hands that have a peer plus a flush draw which means infinite equity and well we tried to find a sizing to hurt them but here it's a clear thing we are charging draws this is not about denying equity right only charging draws that's just what we're trying to do here right i like the ideas of just jamming exploitatively against some people i think this is actually hilariously great but it's like not in the solver because villain obviously is protected with ace four with ace nine so yeah and we just yeah charge them and check and this is here what we see right we have the large bet just a lot right the other bet okay just like a little thinner value maybe with something like ace-jack and something that blocks some stuff. But what is cool here is that we have very face-up what Willian is playing, right? So we can do pretty cool things that if we have our low-frequency king that we see bet on the flop, we can do something fancy like this here. Let's have a look at the king-queen of clubs. Actually, this is my favorite bet on the turn like it's i only sometimes do it on the flop but we get ace x to fold on that turn and we get called by all the king x of spades and all the four x of spades and all the nine x of hearts that's like the best two-way play you can ever have so this is just something that's going on it's just for me important here hey we have we are playing against a face up range right it's just if we bet too big here villain will start lots of donking on the river which well this is a gto wizard thing or like a perfect player thing against the standard opponent who is just answering by calling and then will mainly just check the river it makes sense to only use that big bet as an exploit okay so all right let's let's see what happens here right river then is okay he jams some ace nines and pocket fours and some monster draws that's the theoretical answer and then see there's like if there's a deuce of hearts coming in there's actually this donking happening i don't believe in that too much and on the spades even more i think yeah on spades definitely on spades more where is it deuce of spades actually not that much more but okay right so it's just it's important to have a clear plan that this is not about denying equity this is about charging draws right i expect him to call certain hands i know exactly which hands he has and this maybe can give you a good idea for how to play the river as well if like the river is a freaking break right so stuff like that that was a second last life example yeah we check back king queen on the river and villain gets a heart attack this is another thing i like doing a lot it's like when it's like lower cards what you can do is just let's say this here is the three of spades leads to the same thing now the best bet is pocket fives right because we have that we fold out ace x we fold out something didn't work we're interested in the turn we fold out king x we followed ace x we get called by 4x and by 3x so it's kind of a value merge whatsoever it's like it has really really good value to bet fives here and this really gets the hard attack there right we go for the max sizing will unfold a7 river then let's get a freaking bad card for us like a break this year another bad card but for fives and yeah villain checks to us and well we actually have where is it when i mean not very often but like have some skin in the game here are you planning to stream any zoom sessions in the near future no i'm in austria again and i'm mainly playing high stakes and very high stakes so yeah just no no time for for playing some some random zoom sessions i make some videos where they cut the highlights whenever there's like no time but streaming just takes a lot of time. Okay, 9 in green more bad 75 because less draws. I think it's just not that face up. The structure will look quite the same because here come are two things that come together the way we want to attack his medium strong hands. Where is it here? That's so it's kind of the same mix I would say because like the charging draws and the charge like attacking his ace-10 ace- 8 kind of goes hand in hand here right as we said often a mix of multiple plans we're having okay now last one play another rebound pop this time button small line is allowed to re-raise this time and button calls and the flop is nine five juice with a flush draw all right so i should have asked but now we know that the best sizing we want to use is something like 75% pot to really blast it right our advantage is jacks tens queens kings here villain does not hit too much none of his over cards hit he has some sets but well that's a cooler if we run into those so we are again we start to charge here charging now we get a certain turn card and villain's calling jamming like jacks tens sometimes jamming some ace nine things are not getting better for those hands so you better get it sit in like some ace eight a seven of spades okay blue calls and he has like sixes sevens eights with spade with hearts i don't know like backdoor flush draw ace jack of hearts ace jack of spades like five x nine x and so on so let's get a freaking card what about the of hearts? What is our plan on the seven of hearts? I mean we had that one already. But here we go. Right. So we are playing against a clear pattern. And this is what we want to do. Right. There's no equity to be denied. Villain sits on flush draws and backdoor flush draws. Plus over cards. He sits on peers. But all those peers have a gut shot going for them now. Or another over card. And so on. So it's just like one thing. And that means everything what we have charging the draws. Villain is priced in with ace queen. Villain is priced in with ace jack. Actually, like we get to the point that ace jack is indifferent. This is great. Ace 10 of spades indifferent, right? Such a powerful play. Ace four, okay, is a clear call. Ace five is a clear call, right? Peer plus overcard plus flush draw. But this is what we challenge him for all right so yeah i'm just thinking about do i have one more here i think i have one more idea in mind where it fits but let's go back to the slides first as i never consider on spades villain is protected we cannot just jam on spades villain is protected he has infinite flushes so what we do on spades is what you win okay i'm actually not using this large sizing in game so we're just freaking ripping it in on spades as well perfect because he has eights and sixes with spades you got me on this one guys wow i'm actually using half pot mainly on that board for other reasons i know that this is the preferred solver size but i'm mainly using this year i have to save me now right and then on spades there's just too much pot left to jam this is the game tree i have mind. But it seems like if we put in enough money on the flop we force him a to jam enough flush draws in position because with his ace eight of spades he doesn't want to get in that spot that he's indifferent on the turn so he jams himself and yeah we just make him call hands that really suck on that seven. King in green we can split things up no like we have jacks and tens they don't like he hits a king. He hits a king, we hit a king. We are still just think about it that way. Oh sorry, I need to take that bet sizing he calls. Now let's get king. We keep going with this one. Just the best card in the deck for us. Yeah, just always try to think about what are you attacking, right? Here's like pocket sevens, pocket eights, pocket sixes, five six, nine eight and so on. And this is what you want to attack that that helps a little. See bet jams from the small blind in this spot on something like jack 10x flush draw no only shorter not for 100 bigs not for 100 bigs you make a two street game out of it rmg kairudi or like this exists for like for the empty dealers out there it's like exists for like 40 50 big blind three bad spots they play a little like the four bad spot here in the cash game world with a deep stack where we can just jam things all right right. So I want to go back to the slides to see what's going on there. Let's have a look. In the end, I call that one, right? Yeah, don't get me wrong. I didn't want to give any shit to that explanation of upswing poker because it's a correct one. It's just I wanted to give a bigger picture. And here I call protection a human-made concept that mainly focuses on this being ahead now. This is a big problem that people think about this being ahead or being behind like if you have ever watched any poker on YouTube or like TV or something. It's like it's a suck out when you were ahead, whatever It's like when the draw gets there instead of seeing that as a game of equity, right? It's like being ahead or being behind might mean some spot like where one guy has 100% and the other one has zero But they talk about about it the same way like when it's 53 and 47. So we want to take that into account. And this is important to be more precise with what we are playing. So protection is kind of a concept that we want to fold out equity and pay a certain price to fold out a certain amount of equity. This can be any price though. We have seen a range of jamming 140% pot to betting 10% pot today in spots where, well, either size made a lot of sense to achieve a certain goal, to charge the correct price for the EV a certain range part of Villain is having. And this is what we need to figure out given a certain situation Villain gets to spot with like the range part more often or less often right that on ace king four It's just very interesting how he plays those all those offsuit gut shots and on ace king four in a four bet pots where we play against all the peers, well that's kind of the idea why that matters there. So what we do here is we try to design the villain's continuing range by choosing good bet sizing. We want to either fold out those hands or we want to charge those. Actually the perfect spot is where we don't care. In some spots or lots of spots we can just expect people to answer with a certain strategy and then again want to be precise i want to say okay i deny equity expecting him to fold certain hands or i'm charging draws draws can be over cards draws can be gut shots draws can be flush draws open enders everything can be a draw right everything that still has equity against us charging his draws when i pretty much have a good expectation like i don't want to say more than 50 equity because that depends on future game but kind of that right if i have a value hand on the turn villain has a flush draw i have around about like 80 82 equity against him depends on over cards or added gut shots and stuff like that so it's a good thing if i build a pot now this is the charging part all right so here most important thing i said already on the flop it is rather a game of equities than a game of bluffs and value bets on the turn let's okay let's face it we can start talking about bluffs and value bets if we have 80 equity against a draw it's a freaking value bet on the flop it's like kind of i don't know whatsoever we are building a pot that's it all right key takeaways for today maybe because i have one minute left i have a little add-on for you guys like key takeaways be precise that should be the headline here that i missed split up protection into denying equity and charging draw the more you can really articulate what you are doing the better your decisions are and when you want to deny equity it is always a very good thing to start thinking about villains weakest range part again a little add-on that matters on ace king four It does not matter what he does with ten seven It matters what he does with those offsuit gutshot that are freaking queen high So this is something on three deuce deuce Well it matters what he does with his weakest hands because even his weakest hands matter because they can make a top pair on the turn And then think about villains quality of draws when charging draw if it's like on three deuce deuce just two strong over cards maybe half card is our size if it's like on king deuce deuce just two under cards to the king that might be a draw that actually might be drawing dead against the king already well then a smaller size is this is the main thing and now again the protection kind of this is the little add-on right i didn't prepare anything it's just still stuck in my head it's something that where we try to get called by hands we have equity against this includes bluffs right so if we have only 20 that's still okay right we want to get called and have 20 instead of zero percent so we want to get called when we have equity like by hands that we have equity against and we want to fold out hands that have equity against us and this is the whole back and forth and now for wide ranges I'm asking you when we have nothing. What are the main hands we should care about? This is a very general question But maybe someone gets it So if we play wide ranges What is the best thing that can happen to us? Regarding that protection sense if you think about we want to fold out equity as much equity as possible possible and we want to get called by hands that we have as much equity as possible against hold out better nothing try to be more precise hold out better nothing is the correct way try to be as precise as possible you can even give an example fold out better kickers clear out top pair outs all right so it's like having equity having equity that we can value bet so having equity against villains call downrange that is something with a clear top pair outs but i was more after what kipadas and waylo are talking about that queen eyes to fall out king eyes not really no even better than that fall out hands that would win on showdown even if they not improve betting 10-5 suited and fall out jack 10 off this is is what I mean, right? So folding out dominating hands. And this can be in every spot. I call those the small coolers, right? So the small coolers. I'll give you an example where we see that. It's a typical thing. Let's go for a, where is it? A board like kind of a random board. Button versus small and folds, big blind calls. Give me a random board. King, seven, deuce. Let's kill the flush draw for now. We can obviously bet a lot of hands in position, right? There's like, you could think about where is that in our paint ranking, right? We want to fold out something like jack nine with two overcards to the seven. Definitely enough to put out a small bet. So that's what we're doing here. Villainous calling, we're pretty much c-betting full range. The turn is kind of a, like a decent card for us in position. Let's put out a jack here. And now we can talk about queen 10. We can talk about whatever. What is the most interesting thing here? First of all we are using lots of over bets. Not to charge draws but to attack his medium strong hands to get max value. But this year let's have a look at the ace-axe offsuit. What we are doing is we are not betting ace-10, never. But we are starting with the weak ones first. Ace-4, ace-5. This is what we we are doing here and this is a little effect that has like a mass plays a massive role right let's say we bet this here 15 what happens next little unfolds ace 9 ace 8 ace 7 this is the reason why we are never betting ace 10 and we are pretty much always betting ace 4 ace 5 this is the massive effect because what happens in the end we fold out hands that have i don't want to give a wrong number That have massive equity against us, right? If we fold out queen nine, that's good But it has like way different equity against us if you fold out pocket something it's still good But actually the hands that dominate us have more equity against us So this is something to often have in mind the wider the ranges are like blind versus blind Especially that like having nine eight folding out ten nine is a major major major success and stuff like that right we're like this is something we see in the solver world maybe here as well is let's say i make another example king nine deuce so again we have all the broadway gut shots and the turn is a not a great card like a three of clubs and now let's first see again on the button we obviously have a very high seabed frequency with with all and after the gut shots this time villain check raises some of those calls the majority of those and then on the turn We have a decision to make and we again have a mix betting all those gut shots All right, but here it's kind of a big mix just because well villain can react with blockers And he knows like whatever card comes how often we have something. This is why this is wild mix let's be honest what i do here is i bet jack 10 100 of the time and queen jack a little less again the same domination effect villain is not the solver he doesn't know whether i hit a queen on the river way more than i hit a 10 on the river right no way he knows it because he looks at that sim and it kind of looks all the same but with jack 10 i want to fold out queen jack now every single time with queen jack actually i can sometimes check back because i know i get the small coolers on my side if i hit a river a queen or a jack well i'm covering this guy right it's like i have the cooler on my side and this is all the small issues that is sometimes that needs to get stuck in our head because it's always small ev but it comes up all the time so this was my little add-on that was not prepared but yeah all right cool let's wrap it up here again I show you this here the key takeaways think about the weakest range part that matters I think this is an important add-on that I forgot or didn't think about when writing it down but speaking it out right this is why I like speaking it out loud I felt like it's not correct what's there so we need the that matters we are not interested in hands that are really low EV not not mattering and yeah let's wrap it up here thanks for joining i hope you enjoyed it and yeah see you in the next one i guess okay great that i stood easy next next beer is on me hit me up
