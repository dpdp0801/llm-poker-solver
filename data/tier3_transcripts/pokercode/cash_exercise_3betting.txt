### TOPIC: cash exercise 3betting
 All right guys it looks like the standard live play video but actually with this video I want to open up a new little topic in all our coaching world and I call this one exercises. So what I like doing is to really have a goal when going to a session. This can be a session focus on either topic usually one that I'm just working at anyways because this is just way more yeah it's it's it's in a way just way better you learn more by focusing on one thing instead of trying a gazillion things out and trying to do that right at the same time so for this session and there will be more to come i will start with one of my favorite session focuses i'm doing regularly and this is big blind three betting so one thing people keep doing wrong is just forgetting bluffs from the big blind and not being aggressive enough big blind versus small bind especially so how i want to start that with is just i take the chart i'm having right you can take this one that you see here as you know I'm not providing charts really because anything is fine but it's you can make your own plan you can mix less it's just go with something that makes sense for you anything you find is good in a way and then try to stick to those ranges knowing them post-flop so now what I do is just taking that little chart here and I start with big blind versus under the gun right this is versus 2.5x with zoom 500 rake or no it's 2k rake actually so this will be tighter when it comes to defending in the zoom 200 game here but the structure of the three bet range is important to me. So okay and I try to memorize them a little it's queens queens plus kind of. Jack's not always three betting, ace king not always three betting. It's the majority of the suited broadways, it's a portion of those suited connectors and then it's this mix of ace, ace seven, ace six, ace five, ace four, ace three, ace deuce as well as kingighs. We pretty much do not see queen and jack-highs really. So maybe some queen-highs. So first thing I want to remember under the gun ace-axe, king-axe suited. I want whenever I have that hand in the big blind and face an open race from under the gun, I want to have the same trigger in my mind like looking at pocket aces because we won't forget two three bad aces, but we will forget so we could go on our middle position cut off let's focus on the button down here now how does the range against button look like all right so nines plus and then there's kind of the gap when it comes to the pockets ace queen offsuit all right then it gets a little less but don't forget those frequency three bets here especially especially maybe against people who overfold. Those can be great. Usually this is what people forget 100%. The full suited broadways, queen, jack, queen, 10, ace, 10, somehow not that much. We could go now into detail why, but that's not the point. Then that middle-ish stuff, I call it pretty much those that cover the boards my aces hate. I want to have something on 7, 8, 10, kind of. Oh, wall, jack, 9, let's go. Again, the suited connectors as well as the suited aces. Here we have the clear suited low aces, next best king highs and queen highs, never low. So this is something to keep in mind. And then big line versus small mind is not in here just give me a second to pull out the right one here as well big blind versus small blind let's take this here all right we have nines plus eights plus all the suited connectors offsuit just ace queen mainly suited broadways yes and then again that mix of suited aces suited kings offsuit shit ace high king high not the good ones but exactly the ones that we are not three betting on the offsuit side this is what we want to take on the suited side so now what i'm trying to do is really run not really a randomizer but just overdo it in that session right always looking especially at the hands in the big blind think about whether they are trigger or not and then overdo it when it comes to big blind three betting right this evens out a little our overall stats because usually in those sessions as i said we won't forget the three bet aces but we will forget to three bet jack eight offsuit big blind versus small blind for some frequency. So now this is a little little exercise. Obviously I'm still talking you through hands if something interesting is coming up, but now with that special focus I have a clear goal in that session. And hopefully we get some of those big blind spots. Let's just start with that ace-king jam here. No specific reads on that is king playing well i'm still hoping to get the fold snap call looks like a flip all right king queen offsuit sometimes a four bet sometimes a call against that guy let's see whether i have some preference will not fall to three but versus fall versus fold to 4-bet. It's kind of normal. I'm just going to call here. And then queen 3 off. Again, this is our exercise. What would be a queen that I'm 3-betting here? Definitely not queen 3, but queen 8, queen 9, maybe even queen 7. Just to remind yourself of what's the plan. Down here playing that three bet pot while I fold those queens against a pot size bet from a recreational player. Queen, I probably, this is 100% check. Don't want to fold out his queen jack of hearts give up that I'm actually doing pretty well against. I'm not winning often because he should have all the ace highs, but I cannot bluff this one. That would be massive over bluffing. 10 improves some of my check downs but still I'm not taking king queen to bluff him off ace queen. Sometimes same hand mainly losing to ace highs and he has ace nine of clubs which is totally fine by him. So I missed talking about the top left there I actually did defend queen five suited in the big blind against the cutoff right should have talked about okay it's not the low queens suited queens it's the queen nine and there you even see like me not even this is my session focus right now i was distracted and if i had queen eight in that spot i was probably going for zero percent three badbet. 6-7 suited let's go first spot to just overdo it. I go with 100% now not 40% but this makes up for the other times in the other sessions. Obviously villain has no chance of knowing that I go super crazy now it's just a training session it's an exercise I want to go I want to really let that sink in What are my hands and then go a little too crazy with them? So it's more likely I remember then and then the next time Right, let's waiting for the next big blind hands Jack-8 offsuit, right? First trigger, boom! If it's folded to the small blind, this is a high frequency three bet. If he open raises then here, nothing to do. But still, training your mind for those hands. A6 off will be a mainly check on the top left. Small bet obviously fine as well. This guy is quite aggressive with check raising so there's no reason to go too light with the c-bets. Trying to check down versus KQ KJ high here. And now the overbet obviously could be a bluff but yeah not the hand I want to look things up with All right 5-8 offsuit will never be a 3-bet from the big blind. Ace-jack suited now that the first two persons folded already will pretty much always be a 3-bet, so Getting prepared Sizing up a little because he sizes up just Just adjusting my sizing. 4-5 off suit will never be a three bet here. Ace-jack suited of spades. I think I'm just going for betting high frequency big sizing which is half pot here for me. Blocking ace-six suited is a little plus. Not blocking backdoor flush draws even though flushes are not the coolest thing in the world here is uh seven sorry call here even though he has that ace most of the time but do six suited again no full trash i need that suited connector here i will play quite some some post flop there against good players right i could i could go a little crazy now that would be the exploitative part with hands like that against someone who is open raising too light and over folds versus three bet which he looks like right now then i can add on that one part but first important for that session it is four five suited five six suited these are the hands we're looking for because we want to have some equity and playability post flop when we get called, which should happen quite often there. This was just like pure overfolding by him on like low sample that made me adjust stuff. All right. 5-9 suited, right? We can already think about when could that be a three bet. Big blind versus small blind. Maybe it will be more like 10, 3, 10, 4, 10, 5 suited or like jack highs. This is seems to be a little too weak, but still maybe again, if someone's over-folding, this is a great addition. While I just play my seven, eight suited kind of normal, straightforward there against a small blind three bet, definitely calling, flopping a flush draw going from there he's checking this board this will be a mix those low flush draws i rolled a number that i just checked back here i don't have a specific read that he's like check over folding insane that he's just on uh actually he is just like giving up his king 10 of clubs maybe a little too much in c betting when he has it just like low frequency but if like four out of five or something of his checks end up being check folds that's maybe already a reason enough to just start start trying check raise is something i wouldn't expect from like that player type too much when then he has it. It's a great play here to not only bet big but sometimes have the check raise as well. Our hand is obviously a nice continuation. Now the money goes in the middle unfortunately even if he jams he will have like pocket tens but then it might still be ace five suited. I don't have the reads to discount discount anything here top left jack six again to weak jack seven jack eight against 2.5 x we could maybe find something but again working on our triggers here and this will be pocket tens jacks all day long but with that additional equity i need one bluff in a lifetime and then i'm I have a good call so good luck it is the pocket jacks it's you know like calling those hands is not that tough if people play straightforward all the time I expected him to always bet that big that would be straightforward but now after the check yeah my hand plays itself I need one or two ace-5 suited combos and my call is profitable with a peer. I'm pretty much folding all kinds of... I'm like over-folding the shit out of it. But this hand is the one that is slightly losing versus his specific hand and as I said we just need the one or two bluffs in there. there now i kind of missed your ace-4 offsuit, big blind vs. button, never a 3-bet, ace-7, ace-8, ace-9, we can roll something in. While maybe that ace-10 of spades up there was a little interesting, I mainly used that as a bluff because I was having the nice suits that I would have when I have jack- of spades and ace Jack of spades so I could wrap that boat pretty well let's go queen do suited never a three bad against any position Queen Jack off won't be part of our squeezing range. I didn't have a look at squeezing ranges before, but they will look quite similar, like 3-betting versus early position there. Maybe a little weighted towards hands that do not do well multi-way and prefer a little heads-up. Now this hand, especially with with the diamond I just like betting there. Both are uncapped, the eight especially hits the cutoff so over betting doesn't make sense. This hand doesn't play well as a check call so yeah that's pretty much our option here. Ace-five suited of hearts. I think every two over cards are better. That five backdoor straight is not something too cool. C betting can't be that wrong but should be one of our weakest hands here actually. Just going the check folding range. Now checking again. I mean he is scared of me having ace-king, ace-queen. I'm scared of him having ace-jack, ace-ten, ace-queen. It's kind of a... And now just going for a block bet. He sits on eight, seven, six, seven. I can have random king-ten of clubs that I gave up. Story should check out that I have both bluffs and value. Called by... yeah, he has a better ace and I think he has ace queen which should definitely get more money in than just a block bet. Here this is definitely a river race if not a higher frequency turn bet. Definitely getting more money in there in his shoes. So yeah's okay. So ace-9 suited here is like okay the suited aces we like to 3-bet. We prefer the low suited aces a little because here what happens is if we 3-bet well he folds stuff like king-9 like ace-8 stuff that we are ahead of so his big sizing scares me a little but let's let's go from there he seems to be a recreational let's just play our hand call our mid mid pair once and against that position a monotone like even he might be bluffing but king ten king queen with a diamond or so has so much equity there's not much to be gained here by calling with any reads ace ten offsuit actually against button could be a frequency three bet sometimes. here we're just over calling. now that 10 actually hits the open raiser a lot. no reason to go for like two streets or anything so just checking to him again. against that sizing down there i think i need to defend my ace queen off with some frequency where's that race no here is how often is he going crazy 13 i mean not too much but he folds something to five pets so i think that should perform fine sizing is just just too small there and I beat I'm not beating value but I play well against value like jacks and tens so my ace ten is going to call here definitely against the ten against a kind of splashy player six bucks I got a call I'm still ahead of some of his bluffs he might might have queen jack suited, ace jack suited, ace jack offsuit even sometimes. King four suited, I didn't mention here. Big line versus small line. We could put that in a three betting range sometimes. We had the suited kings, the suited aces. And now here, ace queen offsuit against that manually sized stuff. That looks like too much of a plan. I think my hand is quite a nice catcher sometimes six two suited not an option all right this is interesting so this guy's check calling and now check raising he's pretty much wrapping ace four pocket eights shouldn't be check raising seven six maybe i mean i'm definitely just calling this is the only card i pretty much do not want to see i'm happy to stack off any non-diamond if he has six seven he has six seven he needs to call it in the first place and now i'm just infinite protected because I bet diamonds and I call the small race there and now I think I just have to fold my four I don't see him getting there with any bluffs like this is not a not a bluffy guy aces is 100 three bet here and yeah king Queen suited high frequency three-bet as well getting the snap call from the apparently recreational player six station my note says that's not a good sign so i would only fold out things like queen jack of diamonds so i guess against six station. If I make that note, there is a reason I'm just going to check call mode and then hope to hit something. Pocket eights are still sometimes a three bet versus the button, so we are overdoing it here. It's not a hundred percent call. With a backdoor flush draw, I like calling here. I don't think he's ever like betting ace queen, king. So whenever I hit my top pair, it's nice. And here, I think I'm just hoping that he gives up a bluff. Not like if I write down six station here. I mean, I don't have any worse hand, right? If he calls sevens and eights, it's it's i don't find any bluff i'm under bluffing here but this hand is a must so i'm not turning anything into bluff if he calls that that's okay i'm actually happy when he calls because i'm under bluffing okay so i'll try it first to talk myself into the zero percent bluff but yeah, no, that's fine. This here small c-bet now, this sizing doesn't make any sense to be honest. We're like all the ace-axe are splitting. I have more of the six-axe. He just bets just bets ace queen again to then check back I mean, okay, I call an ace we chop and I continue better hands. So Yeah Jack for offsuit will never be a three bad against any position pocket nines we could flat here it's like 9.5 to win that total kind of a set value this guy has queens plus ace king that's it it's like a super super tight player against that i think for that price we can get away with a call and make slight profit on it like really really thin. ace king suited here i think i can still go for i mean this is never a bluff so i think i'm just jamming anyways there's not much this spot is weird with the limper always because people are so tight against that it's not like me opening but ace king i just completely readless this probably just leads to the best outcome for me if i knew that he's like on ace queen ace jack i could like build a very very small four betting range calling out of position there with just ace king no clue how to navigate from there on it's just very very tough so a7 offsuit here already looking at it okay against small blind first in this is quite some frequency three bad we can mix it in very very rarely against the button here it's just a fold 7 3 off obviously never three betting small blind versus a big blind. I think here we can block bet as a bluff. Folding out something like Jack-10 is pretty important for me. He doesn't look like the biggest station, so I'll give some trouble to 6-7, 5-x, that kind of stuff. False, that's good. 7-8 offsuit, again, pretty much never a 3-bet. Not big blind versus small blind, just not the hand category you want to play in the 3- pot there. It's called though That board He is let's see. Do I have his check fold in the HUD? I'm not sure. I'm not check folding much. So this can be mixed check back It's not like when I bet and hit my my heart. I cannot really value bet anymore So A6 offsuit is a high frequency three bet. I didn't roll a three bet number, but we are overdoing it. That's the plan. So here both checking and betting is fine again. Just too much equity and guess this is a high frequency bet. Here in that three bet pot, small blind versus cutoff, we start off on that board with a small c-bet. Actually we keep batting small here targeting all his pockets. It's not like I have an ace queen is like the nuts. He should have ace king in his flatting range. Stuff like that. We want to give him trouble throughout the whole hand. He should raise most of his 9x on the turn and now I think we keep block betting. I'm not sure about that part here but it makes a lot of sense to me. Call, call, call, muck. I saw you at ace-10 if you were interested. King-10 offsuit here against the button. mug i saw yet ace 10 if you're interested king 10 offsuit here against the button this is a three bet we sometimes want to take i'm not against middle position though for offsuit hand we really just take the best Top left, not calling for the chop there. 10-8 suited, so here, okay. Jack-9 suited, 100% pretty much against the button. Here now important, this is a don't-don't, remember that as like a high frequency out of position, three betting hand against under the gun. We are pretty much never using that. It's like the lower suited connectors. And here we need the king highs and the ace highs. Just because villain is flatting something like kings and queens, even very, very high frequency. So we don't want to like get into a spot where we are just like such equity underdogs just like three bank getting called by queens and being kind of drawing dead is not our plan four five performs way better there and here this was interesting this guy who's marked blue already which means like super bananas okay just getting it in over two streets but but the small one, leave him some room for splashing. I start with and now I guess he has jacks, tens, nines, whatever. Sure he can have a flush, even though he should jam most flush draws on the flop. I'm just splashing it in here, I'm against that player type. Give him a chance to put me on ace king with a spade even though he folds that's okay so definitely no gto sizing plan there though all right let's actually wrap it up here and yeah that was just a very very quick insight of how i think a good exercise can look like we had a clear plan what do we look at and you see that even with that focus while playing other hands it was super tough right to not forget anything right i think i lost like talking about two three hands that were actually options to three bet in the first place so make sure to work on that your special areas that you want to work at really dedicate a couple of sessions to that and repeat it over and over again and then all that gets very very natural as it gets very natural to hate turn cards like that so here's flush draws but against the half pot sizing he should jam quite a lot so it's not that scary he can have queen jack suited sucks so i hope for him to have king jack and king queen suited because that cannot be spades or jacks and queens with a spade good luck i'm not folding and yeah call is that ace aces okay i think this is a jam for him as well on the flop okay so we started off bad with the seven eight of diamonds we finished bad with the ace king into aces not a big deal but again it's about the exercise so really make sure big man three bets is a big league for lots of people this is actually the position people overfall the most against so that just means for you hey there's lots of room to be different than your player pool to gain ev through that get in a spot where you have range advantage not advantage and people are usually overfolding so yeah make sure you doesn't you do not have to copy my ranges right they have for a certain game for it's it's more about the structure what makes sense okay the higher suited cards versus under the gun middle position against the button it changes a little big line versus small blind whether you mix everything or you have your couple of hundred percent hands that's all great right make your own chart make sure it's some somewhat fits together and then train train the i train the trigger right really you want to have that feeling with 10-8 offsuit the same way you have it with aces. That would be the goal of that whole exercise. All right, see you in the next video there about typical exercises I'm doing. I hope you learned something, could take it away from this video and then maybe run a little better than me in those 30 minutes.
