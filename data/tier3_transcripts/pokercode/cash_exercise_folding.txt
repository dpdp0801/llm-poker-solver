### TOPIC: cash exercise folding
 Back for the next episode of our little exercise series. Again I'm going to play four tables of zoom trying to put the focus of my session on one specific topic. That should help me to get better better over time realizing those spots. So today it is all about bluff catches and actually since we talk so often about it and we have the problem of people celebrating our cool hero calls and us finding reasons to call all the time i want to turn things around to just sharpen my mind a little to find those spots where actually we love looking for reasons to call but if we are honest with ourselves the fold is often the best option so today's session is all about finding reasons to fold i will play like the biggest knit of all times and let's see how that goes i expect to have a great session actually because i have an excuse now with that session focus to just yeah make very very easy decisions but still important to really name everything correctly like when do we have a bluff catcher when do we beat his value what are we looking for all right we have a straight here that's a board we can see that a lot i could size up here if someone's never raising which is probably the case for him but yeah let's just freakingly with a big sizing exploitatively. Collecting all the calls, I'm not expecting any bluff raises. Let's keep going, just dodge that queen and king. And dodge queen eight as well as king queen obviously that is a great card and this here sure doesn't make too much sense all right so this is the sizing we're using so half pot bottom right is already a reason to to fold a little more than we should obviously we have a nut gut shot here playing very very well but if i have freaking 9 eight here i could have folded the flop right away pocket kings we are not i mean i'm folding jacks here now right he's coming from under the gun not really finding too much why i should be where's actually the i'm missing one number but yeah so this is just an easy jam here. He has queens and he has ace king in his four betting range so definitely we have to get in here not trying to dodge aces even though it would fit into this session today. The big sizing would be a reason to just fold our jacks and tens. And actually there is nothing that could ever tank call like if he thinks about tank calling there his four betting range is shit so yeah oh we have nothing there is a check race going on so we just fold I mean anyways this player is super nitty when it comes to aggression so very very easy here in that ace queen four i'm still range betting could obviously check back with the plan of folding but i'm i'm not like i want to get thrown into those spots not force it and like play like a face face up idiot so here check check if he bets now right i will see that okay we block jack 10 and10, like some of his probably main bluffs that he has offsuit. Sure, we could look for unblocking 5-3, deuce-3, and 5-deuce as well, but nope, we don't know whether he has it. He's overbetting. We have all kinds of ace-axes that we check back on the turn. He is a nit, like there's actually no reason to call whatsoever, and plenty of reasons to fold. We are looking for reasons to fold, so this is how we follow up here. 4-5 suited is pretty close sometimes opening here this is a rather raggish table so this is our reason to fold. facing a big donk bet here from someone who likes to stack facing a big donk bet here from someone who likes to stack off light i mean here we find reasons for folding but this is just too good to continue and gives us an easy decision here half pot on the bottom gives us a reason to not check raise too much because it should be a little stronger we don't have diamonds so mainly check calling turn king we have an open ender but not to the nuts anymore the queen doesn't give us nuts obviously diamonds are not perfect either so easy turn check fold against any reasonable sizing he pots it not a big deal and here i mean now our hand just got way worse we had the back door, the backdoor flush draw, now it's just six outs to hit our top here. Q10 suited against someone who shows clear interest in the pot is just a very easy fold. 8-4 suited against min race i guess it's good enough here with extra german rake a hut not working i think this is plenty of reason to just find a fold. Queen-8 suited here against a big blind 3-bet, even though it's on the smaller side for the big blind sizing, it's even a chart fold, so happy to fold. I love repeating that word fold so often.-3 off fold 6-7 off against a somewhat reasonable preflop player fold fold 7-4 suited on the button is close but against two reasonable players just a fold King do suited same thing here I think this is just an open race though. It's a 3-bet, nothing to worry about, we played it perfectly. So here I think betting again performs a little better against someone who's never bluffing because if I check back now I actually need to fold if he bets big on the river, which here I think I have just clear value. If he has king queen and is not check raising against the half pot, okay. That's fine. As I was trying to exploit him at the same time, that was not like me double barreling to not having to fold on the river that's that's not the deal I just think it was the better play. Down here pot betting is very interesting because this is pocket Jacks and pocket Jacks only and ace-10 maybe some better flush draws not really so I think I play it mainly without fold equity and I'm just calling here with a plan to donk lots of turns that hit I mean especially those that hit me this here hits not my hand but my range but I have a nice I think I'm still going to block bet just in case he has some random bluffs it's like queen jack and i fuck him totally up by doing so and now i think we just have a very easy check fold our pocket sevens is oh i called the pocket jacks what a surprise well played by you sir yeah i think he won the hand but i fucked him up big time like not investing any money without having it i know his hand from the flop right it's like actually the turn makes sense against that but if he doesn't even raise the turn here this is how i lose least money wow this is it's insane it's just so stupid how face up you can be there and it's but if that range was wider than that i wouldn't be like correct 80 of the time when i'm calling the hands so it's like really insane all right anyways so check fold would have been the perfect perfect option there king 10 offsuit i think this is one he has all the ace ace-axe that we just need to barrel. We have offsuit hands from here, high card hands so we get the fold instead of folding ourselves that's great as well. Ace-10 offsuit. Pocket sixes is a mix depending on how I want to play that strategy here. I'm not really folding too much, would be okay but here i think i have a clear edge post flop so i don't want to go crazy and ace 10 wins after checking down still a lot so it's not a pure bluff catcher a pure bluff catcher i would have folded here i actually uh yeah check back twice and then bet against a short stack like that who has all kinds of hands half pot i didn't find the reason to fold he has a turn set maybe should have found the fold but that's fine ace 10 this guy pretty face up i have a nut gut shot but the board disappeared so ace of hearts is still it's not flush draws that give up i'm just splitting or i'm even blocking them so a pretty pretty easy fold could randomize some calls in there in theory but for that we need him to have like some random turn bets. Pocket fours against under the gun smaller race we could consider calling if we want to build like a full calling range here just folding is fine as well not really making money. 8-6 suited against a tight player from middle position. Actually this is hand that makes that better pre-flop, knit, post-flop station. Two good things, right? If we make a hand that we know his hand and once we beat his hand he likes to call. So this this is two good things for hands like that. I'm definitely not defending something like king-nine offsuit though. Can't fold those aces. Ace-queen suited versus a small blind 3-bet here. He seems to be very tight on the sample so far. Let's see this guy. Fold to 5-bet 43, so he can 4-bet fold. Then this is most of the time just a flat. Give that guy some rope to hang himself. Probably not finding a fold in this spot. Ace-Queen suited. Very easy to find folds on that board probably. Especially against someone who 3-bets 8% here so far. And like 7.4 total folding everything to 3-bets just a super nit and those aces against the third pot bet manually scroll something I have no clue click the call button hope for an offsuit Queen and then go from there call this is not the offsuit Queen but doesn't bother me too much ace queen here i think we can float in theory good luck aces versus queens oh offsuit queen wouldn't would not have been good all right so ace queen i think it's a standard float this guy is just so tight pre so why to make why why should we make anything like it's very likely that he just gives up when he's full of here if he has ace eight of spades i don't see him see betting and yeah so not clearly making money with that call so we find a very easy fold ace king suited obviously for bad cutoff versus small blind. Off his defend. Definitely just a check call on that King-Jack four board. The Queen of Hearts just kind of kills things. It's his board. We have a gut shot, which is not to the nut. He sizes up. I have a gut shot that is not to the nuts. I have not a backdoor flush draw. So this is just a fold. Jack eight on the button. Four offsuit, four ten. King eight offsuit is the line, but in that lineup, definitely an open race. Four fold here with definitely c-betting. Suited small versus button three bet. Pocket sevens here. I can flat, I can sometimes three bet, I can fold. All is good. One of those hands just more dependent on how you build your range and where it performs best. 4-5 suited here. I'm blocking mainly folding range so this is a check. I still don't want to say give up. Obviously I'm giving up when he's betting but we can talk about bluffing. 9 though is not really my card so I block 4s, I block 5s, I block 3 4 suited, 3 5 suited which should all be part of his folding range I mean here no not thinking about raising or anything just a clear fold. 10 9 suited those positions pretty rare 3 bad actually so just. It's a high frequency check race though, making already 3-2 straight flush. I have more 8-axes than he has. I'm not blocking 8-9-10-8 suited, that would help a little, like having a spades would be the best combo here to have both backdoor flush draw and the blockers. And here against that nitty guy I'm just trying to check down my ace king high checking a lot on those monotone boards a nine now I think you're checking that a lot we can just bet small as well but I like to have a little more polarized strategy here and ace king here i'm just over betting try to get maximum value out of nine and two pairs maybe i'm calling that nine x he can be betting like pocket fives for protection and that nine i think where's more nines i should have way more nines. I think this is... I can have 5, 4, 6s, 3xs myself. I like donking here even though it's super ridiculous. He might be too scared to bet his overpairs. Checks back his high cards. 7s... no, that's bullshit. What did he have? That's a fancy hand. Queen, Jack of Hearts. Okay. But still, even that is a bluff catcher. Once I overbet Donk there, I'm pretty much wrapping like 9, obviously. But all the pockets in between a 3 and an 8 that are discounted. So, yeah been a fancy move. Ace 8 here I can still win against King Queen King 9 that decided to not bluff so I'm definitely checking back my Ace 8 here. He has Ace-Deuce the bottom pair that's okay Wow that 9-axe that was interesting. I mean he has 9-axx himself so probably donking is not really a thing but me check raising and then check calling that 9 just, I don't know how much 9x I should have. But okay that's not the topic for today. We're checking down our king 7 here, big blind versus button, turning third pier. Unfortunately Willem gets there. I would have obviously check folded all day long no doubt about that because we have nothing and block bluffs so king check off against the four big blind all in i will call doesn't look too promising that flip against min races the seven, against a weaker player I'm definitely calling. And against the squeeze I will call if he over calls. If he folds it's in theory a mix and mix means today we are allowed to just fold. Sharpen your senses for the folding. So I do see that small on that K9- seven board. Here we beat some bluffs. Five six six eight, jack ten, queen ten and have the backup clubs. So this is definitely not foldable. And now we beat his ace of clubs eight, ace of clubs six. So we have a clear value bet with a big sizing. If he raises, I do not find bl bluffs so we have a clear fold then. So here King Jack suited is a mix between four bet, call and fold. He's not really... is he falling to four bets? Not really. So we can call or fold. so why not go for the fold today? And that was really tight. That was really tight. All right, I'm pretty sure it's okay to fold there. If someone has even 29% fold to 4-bet with a linear range, it's like not the moneymaker in those positions. As this pocket sixes against the four bad jam is not a moneymaker. I think nine plus is what we need to call against some people. I go with tens plus against some other people. I take all the pockets because they are just jamming ace king in position there. But yeah, sixes are just a fold. Ace eight suited against this big, big one in three bad is just a fold. Okay. So you feel like I'm, I'm already making a little fun of that, but actually I think it's really, really a great exercise because so often you get lost in what you're actually looking for. And this is like we try so many things at the same time looking at great blockers here trying to exploit certain player types here doing this doing that while sometimes it's very very good to just get back to the basics do i have a pure bluff catcher is someone over bluffing is someone this and that here i just go in that with the knowledge the pool is under bluffing so when when I have a pure bluff catcher or something is a mixed preflop I'm just freaking folding. It's not costing me EV. Yes people can exploit that by going crazy but no one here is going crazy. I have pocket deuces, yes I have an ace as an out if he doesn't have sixes. He can have a beat bluff. So this here is still a six is not great. This is just a mandatory call, right? And I could say like, oh, I put him on a six and fold. This is not what I'm doing here. This is half pot. This is not representing an eight. I'm just calling range here and raise my eights. If he has an eight, that's okay. Queen eight. Okay. For half pot, that's okay. I think I win the split. split not i win half of the pot often enough if he sizes up there easy reason for to finding a fold okay five six seven nine here we have a pretty clear stab with almost any two so we check down ace ten high here he checks back yeah i mean i have nothing going for me so it's a clear fold and yeah this is just really more putting the focus on realizing which situations we are in but if it's a pure catcher it just means that in the perfect world it's zero ev whether we call or fold and then it does actually like i try to make the game a little easier here king queen queen off is 100% fold. Jack nine off is a mixed call versus 2.5x. Here 2.3 okay. We can find the call. That's okay. Here this guy is three betting normal. We have very bad player here. But queen seven suited. The flop won't tell us too much. We would just play two clubs. So just a fold we call all pockets we call like ace high suits hands that are more connected can make a straight so here jack nine will be a bluff catcher once he bets the turn we are not bluff catching on the flop we have something we continue if he bets big now we can just fold we even have like a pure bluff catcher with a bad outs. The jack is not a good out. Here I'm just block betting for value and go from there. Pocket 9s, I'm betting twice for value against all his weaker peers and ace queen. And then check fold. Because exactly those hands won't bluff. He should start having a raising range now, he's probably missing the bluffs then. And he's sitting there with 8, 7, 6s thinking about the call fold decision. Fold is fine. Alright, ace 9, I went for the range bet here, trying to check down my ace-9 now against this Jack-9 and 8-9. Now mainly against this 8-9. This is a half pot I think. My ace of clubs mainly blocks his bluffs. Alright, how does he get to the river with nothing? It's like ace-8, having like ace-8 of clubs. So that's a great reason to find a fold here pocket sevens button versus cutoff I put it in as a higher frequency three bat Queens as a very higher frequency three bat and that aceJack suited against a okay a freaking 4-bet from under the gun with someone who where is it folds not often fold to 5-bet 0 so that means he has like Kings Aces and maybe some Ace-Kings suited so this is a clear fold not even close no kidding and that queens is a call against that cold forebat, but already having in mind that our queens are far away from being the nuts here. But with hearts on that board, we unfortunately need to stack off, hoping to find some jacks, which I think he's folding pre pretty often already. He's a pre-king knit. And we're playing against ace-king. So I might try to get away from it by just calling down or just saying hey I'm getting it in now but he's never calling ace king. I am protected with some 4-5 suited, 6-5 suited in theory at least so I'm trying to just call and get to showdown cheaply. If he jams now I can just fold like there's no bluff in this world. Yes he can have his ace king whatever so don't get value from Jacks. Something like bluffs do not exist. While king 8 suited here, call fold makes... so it's just a fold and the Queens I think checking is fine, betting is both fine go with a check here always important to think about which range we are playing it's not like we have freaking queens we cannot fold it's if his range is kings aces and bluffs since he's probably not bluffing enough then our queens are a freaking bluff catcher and nothing else not anymore he's block betting now so I put him on I don't know what but happy to smash it in this is interesting what this is no clue let's hope we will find out. But I think the honest tank tells us that this was definitely not a bluff. Actually I think it's Kings or Aces. Starting with it we can discount the Ace King. The fancy 10% bet with Ace King I don don't see it the tank I don't see it fold. Fair enough. Alright so half an hour in the books. That was just a little exercise again. And yeah, I hope this is something that you can try out yourself. It's really about the approach. it can look so different right just think about my wording for describing all the hands now right i was laughing at it a little but i really meant it just like a fold here a fold there a fold there because people are not really over bluffing some may be against those we want to have another approach but it's just we want to be flexible with that right to really consider everything when we are actually playing right this is tough, we need our routines for that. In one of the last videos I talked about looking for weaknesses. There we were more looking for things like this could mean we can take something away here, we can put aggression in here, we can do this and that. Could have done the same thing, what about that 10% bet? Do I want to bluff jam something against that or not do i want to do this or that here right here i had that okay folding right against people who are always like people who are always having it when they bet and not necessarily over folding well the only exploit we can do is folding so we want to be ready to do that as well. And yeah, try to mix all those. Take what you're working at yourself right now and build one of those session focus little exercises out of it. Tell me about it in Discord. And yeah, now repeat what I did here. Winning a stack is good. And yeah, have fun folding and good luck finding some nuts to finally make the calls.
