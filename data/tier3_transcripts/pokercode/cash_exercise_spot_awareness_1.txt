### TOPIC: cash exercise spot awareness 1
 All right, welcome to another video. This one is not a standard live play. I thought like while grinding a lot myself the last weeks that there is one point that I personally put a lot of focus on and maybe that was not clear enough for now. So I want to try and make that little exercise together with you. So maybe you have heard me talking a lot. I think pretty sure in the general concepts that I see poker as kind of a multi-discipline sports it's like a decathlon it's like running and jumping and throwing stuff and whatever or just like it's something like football where we need to pass the ball we need to shoot we need to tackle we need to go for headers and so on we can divide and conquer those different disciplines but now i want to showcase that once while playing live how those spots come up and this is like this exercise is meant to raise the awareness for the spot we're in because something that i see a lot is that we misapply concepts from one spots or similarities from one and try to take them into the other while like we are just saying yeah we're betting big because whatever whatever and yeah here i really wanna nail it down what the spot is that we are in right i'll start with two tables see how it goes have the third table as a backup and my plan is to fill that list up with post flop spots reflop all right we got some standard charts whatever we can adjust here and there maybe that make its own list. But now I want to talk about post-flop spots. What's going on there? What are the decision points? What is the spot that I'm in? And maybe just writing it down or being aware helps me already to have kind of a game plan. So let's just see. I have no clue what's going to happen. And I'll play that as a very pure form of poker. So no HUD, no randomizer, no whatsoever. It's about finding out the spot we are in and then going from there. Obviously, I'll explain the hands, the decisions I make on the go as always. And yeah, Jack-4 suited would have been the first one, whether it's like close open race or not. And pocket six is here. If we play with a flatting range, which I'm not here, we could play it here.'s here now it's just sometimes sometimes i'll just let it go for now queen seven suited versus that would be for our pre-flop list like facing extremely open race sizing from under the gun would be something do you know how to react here i don't necessarily i think he's a weaker player that makes it better for me but my hand is kind of shitty and he didn't have a full stack which is interesting for my suited hand and yeah so i'll just let it go all right this looks like some playable hands not when mp3 access but now we are in with the ace nine suited not falling into a cutoff open race not falling to a button open race definitely first in all right we got the first one let's say small blind versus big check board is like, right? I have an idea already how I treat those spots here. I have a range check board, so I don't think about my action on the flop for now. And I will either react by check calling or by check raising. And this is now where my brain needs to start to really work. How I split up my nut flush draws here. I'm definitely check calling ace-king, ace-queen, ace-jack all all day long just having coolers on my side ace five a six with the monster draws are very likely check raises as are ace deuce ace three ace nine seems to be kind of a mix and yeah let's start with the check call hit an ace right now we could talk about dom king or anything i would won't write something like that down as a new spot i'll continue with checking but since he bets small i don't see him too nutted on that flop should check back a lot now which makes sense for me then to donk to not allow that for his random 5x 6x his 7x his 4x and he goes for a yeah very polarizing bet here which makes a lot of sense he cannot value bet an 8 anymore so he pretty much has two pair plus and i have a very strong left catcher here obviously with like nut equity and that 10 is not my card check check i win that's fine all right so we played that one fine i guess right but i knew exactly in which spot i was he had a weaker flush draw so no one knows how that spot would have ended like all right so next one so next one, sorry. If I check raise the flop. So big blind versus button defense versus button probing on, oh, don't want to time out here, probing on monotone board. I went for small, small, just like that fit to my hand, just like the value I wanted to get. He checks back weaker Kings, maybe some better Kings as well. He can check back some flushes, some flush draws, obviously something like a six as well. So I think like block block is just I can check the turn and get one full street on the river or I can start block betting. And mainly I like to keep control over the pot size myself. But this is the second spot where just writing it down, you can ask yourself the question, do you think you're good in that spot? Do you have any clue of the theory? How would you approach that spot with different kinds of hands? Right, just like how good is your passing game? How good is your shooting game? So it's like really, we'll find lots more. And yeah, maybe this is the next one. So pocket jacks, we got now very interesting, early position versus small blind flat, right? I could say recreational makes it special as well because small blind flat usually includes just the hands that are not strong enough to three bets so that should be like pocket tens pocket nines pocket eights some suited broadways but since he already has a green tag i'm just going for value against 10x that he might have as well and now it's a little dodgy and i think i have a rather clear check back but don't expect to see too many bluffs from that guy so it can be pocket nines it can be 10x so i sneak out a little half pot value as an exploit here against a potential recreational player and then take the safe road and check back the river and he apparently is a very recreational player throwing in the 3-8 suited there every now and then. Okay, ace-queen offsuit. Pocket threes, right? So limp pot here. First of all, I iso my pocket threes all day long. I need to get rid of his 7-6 offsuit or like his king-6 offsuit that he might be limping and I'm doing fine against his limp calls and yeah limp race whatever, right? That would make it to the preflop list. Now I can't write down anything. Obviously, it would have been nice as well to play a iso'd pot. And now this guy again, I'm actually just limping to play hands versus him. And fold to 5x. We face that 3-bet here. Mix between call and 4-bet. So since I want to see flops, I'll rather go for the call this time. And interesting next spot. Big line versus small line. Three bet pot. Out of position. Ace high board. All right. So we start by checking. While on the top right, 10-7 deuce rainbow. He checks to me. He should do lots of check raising on that board. My hand is like a mix between bet and check. I'm actually betting this time. Ace queen. I continue a little more more passively with my Ace Queen so we did have blind versus blind stabbing on dry 10 high board okay. Ace Queen we continue by calling I guess if he checks back now we always have the best hand if he is betting now we beat some value he can still go with like Ace Jack I guess just everything beating the 10 pretty much and yeah obviously not loving it because if he goes all the way he's pretty much wrapping ace king only i cannot fold my hand because he has that full frequency himself yeah let's hope to hit the queen maybe or five i mean five doesn't hurt me ace five suited is not in his range therefore barreling the turn four five suited not really so it's like nothing changed he goes all the way he has ace king or better ace queen maybe so i'm definitely not folding ace queen but dredd just talked you through that spot because i have a clear plan what i do on that a sideboard my ace nine isn't different here and i'm mainly folding actually he has the turn pocket tens okay fine hand but we both played it fine definitely i think his pocket tens it a stretch to c-bet that board at high frequency, given that 6-4 connectivity. So something I could take a note off now and maybe start check raising a little more often, because if he does that with like tens, jacks, queens, and all those hands, then he has a big problem. Okay, let's write down the next one. We have a button versus cutter, 3-bet pot, ace, axe suited, which is is not range bad board so my pocket tens here without clubs actually like checking back a lot betting small is totally fine i'm going to check back this time and as aggressor you should do a decent amount of checking and some bets like this right i did improve to some flushes that i'm checking back as well as i did improve to pocket queens so it's not like i'm capped or anything so I need to play my range I have some ace-axe I have pocket queens I have something with a club I have something with two clubs my pocket tens are just very bad and easy fold here so it's just like I named the spot I'm aware of what the spot is and then try to apply the strategy I know about it while maybe not right now but usually like trying to put in some exploits having some stats or whatever so now we have big blind versus button defend trade off board actually not right so it's probing option trade off board right a board where he can use like maybe a larger size and check something and here my jack 10 i actually go with a larger bet doing very very well against all his eight acts like eight nine seven six like all that having that dominated want to get someone in the middle and I feel like this two tabling is actually a very good pace for that little exercise so a seven office obviously fold ace nine kind of like standard but on the on the edge side open race let's hopefully get an in position spot nope didn't have any in position open race and then continuation bet spot so far which is super weird i expected to have lots of those king three nope king 10 is a little too wide so potential button open race on the right definitely here cut off open race and now we have it all right so interesting right so cut off versus big blind and this is, we have two ways of playing that. We can either range bet, that's totally fine. Or we can check back and play like a bigger size on the flop. I go for the range bet, but this is not something to think about already, right? Ace, king, like three broad way board, right? How to play that. So flop strategy is definitely something, right? I now have an idea that I have two options how I want to play that. Instead of just looking at my hand, what does it want to achieve and so on. But it's definitely a spot that, yeah, we could, yeah, we need to put some work in to be good there as in all the others. Jack, five, eight, seven suited, button open race. All right, large, facing a large three bet with a hand that potentially wants to four bet. Against the large one, I just's a little stronger so I rather four bat hands that are a little better just I want to be ahead like have two over cards against the pairs he's calling like ace nine does way better against like eight pocket eights pocket sevens that he might three bat call so here my only option I really take is calling but against that sizing from 2.5 to 12 with linear range, having all the offsuit aces there, I'm actually just folding ace-six, ace-seven, ace-two, ace-three, and I'm just calling ace-five, ace-four. And here, this is as well too loose to continue. So I was just reacting to his large three bet sizing there, given he has a linear range. Against the big blind, I would have called, because his range is a little more polarized, contains something like 10-7 suited and so on what i'd way better against here on the small blind he has ace jack offsuit ace queen offsuit ace king offsuit pocket eights pocket nines pocket tens all full frequency which is just very very bad to play with my hands against that obviously it's not burning money defending a suited ace but it's just reacting to the price all right this is a stretch here this is now on the loose side but we want to get in the mix a little here as we are here. Nope. Alright so next spot even though we know we will be folding our hand to any action. Big blind versus button, defend versus probably a mixed strategy, I guess he is not. See betting range? Mix 45%, stretch something like that should be 45 on mono ace high okay pocket jacks mix between four bet and call we want to see flops right so we are calling and top set all right so and my hand shouldn't interest i'm still happy about it obviously so small blind versus button three bet pot in position and i already call it like large sizing Mixport I'm using large sizing only and some checks on that board so i know my strategy so i write it down here and let's see what he does because we need to react here as caller well he takes some time here let's hope he didn't disconnect all right he uses the large sizing as well so boom i know probably he's using the same strategy as i am he should have like king queen as a major bluff some ace queen ace king just with the two over cards something with backdoor draws like a queen 10 of clubs obviously there's no raising for me involved just i play call only my hand is definitely good enough to call and we go from there i won't jam any turns either if he keeps betting and if he checks i have the new spot coming up right not a new spot for the list but just like something to think about which stabbing sizes do i use what do i trap and so on so while just called for batting ace king off here very large three bat from him i need to adjust here maybe i can go even a little bigger and this is a very easy decision to make ace eight of clubs right this is exactly the kind of backdoor queen ten of club ace eight of clubs that yeah he puts that in the same line like pocket queens this is what what you want to do he found a bluff i think he played his hand super well i sit there with my five six with my four five with my hands always disappear pocket sixes seven six and i obviously have any jack so yeah would have been a little better for him if the jack was in clubs and not the seven just turn those around then i don't have all those jack x of clubs that just snap call him off but yeah right so it's like you can double check did you have a clear idea how you play with your whole range that board how much do you hate your life with your pocket sixes what do you do by the way with nine ten of clubs it's just interesting so ten seven deuce pretty much exactly the same board that we had here already big blind versus small blind stabbing on dry hide board i had queen nine offsuit there before and here actually i'll go for a check it's a trade-off board i use a large sizing actually on that board but ace of diamonds is just a very bad card to have blocking all folds in this world and now i think i tried to go for the check down i would have started something on some jack queen king type terms that are very good for my range and yeah but this time we're the aggressor so that allows me to write down a new spot right we're obviously thinking about both sides but more actively about the one that we are having here checks down a deuce i think he missed the value bet there on the river but yeah blind versus blind 10 high trade off board and here jack 10 i guess is to lose pocket sixes so we have ace high so i could think about this is standard as an exploit i could go with a bigger size because he's usually probably not check raising often enough but i stick to it so right down button versus big blind trade off just meaning here as well that i cannot bet full range trade off board ace high flush draw and here facing a donk from an unknown player i'm just raising that that's usually not two pair it's more like one pair plus some interest in the pot like a nine eight type of oh let's not talk about nine eight now so i want to have one more big street and i take that on the river maybe here's something like king jack queen jack that is calling or a ten but they call the river as well or a queen jack obviously not calling but can hit something that is actually worse than my hand like hitting a queen maybe he block bets then i can raise so yeah going from there and this is obviously another spot button versus big blind trade off board connected facing dunk now he has something or nothing he will call a 10 doesn't care about the sizing so I size up. All right same here. We had like a spot a little similar like that before. Probing option trade off board. It's kind of a similar spot like the what was it before the 10 high I guess. We're at the jack 10. So here I go. I need less. Actually I go big as well. Here we face the next dunk of that player. I'm not folding when I have a heart. Like this, we could rank that a little and put it together with the spot before. I still think it's always slightly different, but we could group them together. That would be fine. And I think that's good enough for another three quarters. I don't care about the seven. I can have it myself. So yeah. And we had obviously on the left side, early, yeah, same hand. Early position versus big blind. Face don face donk like not face donk because we talk about our strategy It's like I call our strategies versus donk on connected trade off board All right I'm missing all the the range bet boards that we usually have a lot of but we'll get them we'll get them So king seven offsuit It's a little too loose like king eight is the line if I have reeds on those guys They're too tight. I start open raising king seven. Now this time ace deuce is definitely too wide here. King three king nine Queen seven, what's like the same suits even? Yeah, wh an off-suit. Little stretch. It's like a mix-open. Dick, Dick, Dick, Kirk. I don't know whether this name comes from it, but there's an animal called Kirk Dick Dick, actually, which is one of my favorite animals in the Vienna Zoo. So maybe check that out. Seven, six off. Without reeds. it's a mixed defense but in that high rake structure i want to know where my ev comes from either from like bluffing him or like fast playing open enders and gut shots or like just like hitting something or taking some spots where he's just a little too weak and benefit from him over-folding at some other point. Or yeah, so when I don't know, I'm a little more on the tight side there.
