### TOPIC: cash exercise spot awareness 2
 In case you wonder about the stack sizes, I lost a hand while pretty much running for a delivery on the door and could not really comment on it or like actually, yeah, just like misread the board. So yeah, all cool. But yeah, I think we're doing fine so far, playing well. Here Martin 12, 13 and this, I guess this is a fold, three-way pot. Let's see which spots come up so so far i miss the most standard spots like single rate spot in position range bed boards i miss some like big blind some more big blind defense big blind versus small blind some more maybe let's actually put in that a7 off against a weaker player against the min race i think that's fine so this brings us the next spot big blind versus belly position here low board. All right. So how to play that. What to check raise there. How crazy to go with our 5x advantage. How to play boards like that. How much to probe. Which sizings to probe. And yeah, I went for a small one there with my 7. Protect against random queen 10 that he has. Checks back and is on give up with his six outs which means 12 equity and obviously the opportunity to attack all kinds of other high cards so super happy with just taking it down or getting calls from ace high yeah pocket sixes will be a three bet versus the cutoff the weakest pair i'm three betting here see whether whether he goes for the call or maybe we can call very very small four bad so here we go and this is actually small blind versus cutoff ace high flush draw board three bad pot as aggressor right this is now one that is not a range bet board but we can make it to one for example by sizing down right this is like checking with some fold equity which i like doing here sometimes And we actually get it done for 10 of the pot he's pretty much not allowed to fold a single hand so we probably exploited someone here right away while we have big blind versus early position low straight board like not more like medium like something we have a straight he doesn't have it so this is already interesting how to play that it gets a big size i think this big size is not really a thing my s10 i guess gets a call here and yeah this year i think something we had before like button versus early position button versus mps caller break 10 high board and here as well i'm just stabbing just folding out anything is fine and against his big bat another big like this really seems really strong This like smells like a set or like a flush already definitely not going anywhere But I highly consider folding King Jack got there Jack 9 got there But I hope he has like King Queen with a spade now King Queen without spade This is such a bad big c-bet, but okay, I'll take it. That's already that you feel okay. I realize a, I try to apply what I know about that spot, while at the same time evaluate my villain's place. To then know right now I evaluate and I can write down okay, bluffs too wide with big sizing on like with wrong cards and so on, right? So makes it way more interesting now for me to check race against this guy, even against his big sizing. To float with like the correct correct backdoors just like he will hit so many runouts that aren't just not good for him and i can do something when he c-bets hands like that so yeah again the awareness helps me to evaluate the spot a little better pocket tens king jack click fold let's see pocket tens small blind flat flat. Wow. Early position. Early position versus small blind flat. Low or like peared plus high card. Right? So again, what is it? He doesn't have a four. Boom. He can have a jack or he has weaker peers. Nines, eights, sevens, maybe a queen offsuit. It's one of those hands. I'm super happy to see bet against that. I think my pocket tens are pretty strong here here and I can c-bet very wide range. And actually I just figured out we are three way, which makes things obviously way worse because the big blind has obviously the four X advantage, but I was just playing against the small blind. So changes the spot. Now I try to get away against pocket eights with just winning. King Jack. Yeah. Okay. I mean, it doesn't make the c-bet bad. Like the big blind is just very, very wide and will fold like all kinds of stuff so yeah focusing on the small blind in that scenario is the right thing just obviously we should focus on getting getting the spot right king seven off suit against 2.25 x it's close but i think that's good enough and we have big blind defense ace let's say a wheel board i call it a wheel board because that's what's possible there on that board and this is just tells me okay it's incredibly good for the big blind he shouldn't see that a lot people are still doing that i counter that with lots of check raising with my hand i cannot do much i have deuce x 5x 4x 3x ace x obviously some flush draws some backdoor flush draws this king high here yeah i could sometimes catch here but the seven of clubs to go with it is not a very good card either and yeah just letting this one go now once we see the second ace and that the board does not get like more straighty everything shifted in button's favor and we actually played as well a cutoff versus big blind free play versus recreational. Right, he limped, we got to see a free flop with 8-4 on like what was it queen 3-3 queen? How to play there, what to bluff, which sizings to use, when to value bet. What would you do with a three? What would you do with a queen against someone who just shows weakness there? Are you bluffing? I wasn't bluffing my 8 high. Were you? How do you make a decision there? Very, very tough. Something to think about. New spot. Multidiscipline sports. Maybe we see a flop. Play a cold 4-bet pot. The tightest of all cold 4-bet pots. Early position versus middle position versus under the gun. And this is something that should not exist. Like this is aces. Some ace king. And maybe a once in a a lifetime bluff i think i'm folding the world out of it i'm just thinking about whether i fold some ace king like as i said it's the tightest of all spots i'm folding jacks here mainly in this position so i have queens kings aces some ace king some ace five suited very low frequency jacks if i call. I'm folding some ace kings. Yeah. I think this is the strongest I've ever seen. I'm just. Like he should be flatting. I'm just folding here. I'm not playing versus an aces range here. Like really think about it. This spot. I think his bet size shouldn't exist. I have aces. Kings. Queens. Ace king. Ace king suited. Ace queen suited. Ace five suited. With some frequency. And low frequency jacks and then i face i'm cold for betting like still i risk that this guy like early position still has it and then he goes over the top against that so he needs to beat that range which is maybe even close for kings right it's like we were slightly deep so it's getting close for kings for 100 big kings are just a jam to get it in against ace king and like ace king suited. But like that min click and like no one ever is bluffing that because he thinks I make the jacks queens fold. So I'm super happy there with folding sometimes not always but yeah pretty pretty incredible stuff. Alright ace five offsuit. Three war teams. And now let's defend here. Big line versus cutoff, two broadway straight T board versus small. How to play here? What is my check raise? Which ace of spades? Like I'm check raising some flush draw. Which ace of spades do I go with? Which offsuit ace of spades? Like I think it's ace nine and ace ten that I want to go with. Ace five and some other constellations here. So here I'm check raising some flush draw. Which ace of spades do I go with? Which offsuit ace of spades? Like I think it's ace nine and ace ten that I want to go with. Ace five and some other constellations here. So here I'm just folding. Getting the love here. All right while here against playing against a cutoff flat things get wild versus big blind bets here. So middle position versus cutoff flatter. I put him on nines, eights, sevens and sixes. So we are hoping for the check back and now I'm happy to go for two streets against those hands. Middle position versus cutoff, flatter, S, aggressor. I call it a one set board. He doesn't have deuces. He doesn't have queens. So it's like when some flatter there that I put on a very, very tight range, especially around those medium strong pockets. This is what I mean with like one set board because that mainly drives my strategy. If are no sets i'm pretty much yeah c betting full range he can't do anything like ace king deuce like ace deuce deuce like king king deuce like there's not much he can be doing with this sitting there on eight seven sixes if it's like six seven deuce like i'm killed i'm crushed i'm crushed he just like half of his range are sets like i'm exaggerating but you know what i mean so pretty pretty freaking freaking stuff here king jack offsuit again a stretch on a tough table but i still want to click on the auto c-bet here didn't still think i didn't have any of those jack three bold clear open race here and now here we have pretty much the thing i just talked about this guy guy flats MP. We should write it down. Early position versus MP. No sad word, right? He has freaking maybe he has ace-queen, some ace-jack, but I'm just betting big here. I say he has pocket eights, pocket nines, pocket sevens, and I maximize value against that. That's what you should do when people are playing face up, which is just very very likely with those flatting ranges yes two combinations of ace jack suited left i know this spot i figure out okay i'm playing versus a very very tight specific range that this time didn't hit anything so i'm happy to invest a lot of money but if the board is like 10 9 8 here i'm check folding aces so just really saying okay we can adjust here and this is all because I'm aware of what I'm doing there right now, right? If you tell a hand history like yeah, the board was like Queen Something something and then I see that and so on. It's like a totally different story. Okay, let's let's try to get the 30 30 fold there This is Little too loose, but I feel it like Like the earlier his position, the more important it is that I cover like king and ace as blockers. And since he is like flatting a lot and not forebetting like jacks and tens in this spot, maybe even queens, just my equity decreases by a lot. The lower my hand is. Obviously, this is a fine card here. And that makes me, I think, yeah yeah this is like works out pretty nicely if i bet like kind of a 2e sizing here linear direction all in will be 73 in the pot and he has like 72 left if my math was somewhat correct i have ace king he shouldn't i have pocket nines he shouldn't now i block his main folding range which is king 10 kingen suited that he should have high frequency that he plays exactly that way. 9-10 of spades maybe in there so I have the clearest give up of all times and would just go all the way with my queen-jack of hearts is the best one I guess blocking his ace-queen ace-jack of hearts float or queen-jack of clubs so yeah unfortunate but king-jack of spades one that was left, the one that got away. Okay, Ace-3 suited here. Yeah, we had in this video already someone 3-betting to 12-axe, where I folded Ace-7 suited here. It's a different spot because we are deeper, makes it better for my suited Ace. I make nut flushes, and he actually is a little smaller than 12-axe, so I'm happy and flop not the nut flush yet but i'm a believer right so we have again small blind versus button slight three bad pot slightly deep ass caller on high or big sizing medium frequency board and here i'm stabbing some nut flush draws just thinking about which one i'm not blocking any of his give ups with it i mean i'm not with a heart anyways but i think i'm stabbing this one and i'm stabbing small and there that probing spot again a trade off board but it changes because we had a high card this time big blind versus button straight to trade off board probing option on high card how should we play how are you playing pocket sevens how are you playing queen 10 9 10 on the turn so here i don't expect too many jams so i'm happy to keep barreling actually this is i mean well if he jams it's the worst but i don't expect it too often usually if i scared a hand like that of getting jammed, then it's the first one we want to check back. But on that run out, I think I'm not, I don't need to be scared of getting jams there. Right now I feel like, okay, I'm not sure in that spot. He checks that board. He's on some like pure give ups. Well, let's look it up in the, in the replay or he can have like a king nine of diamonds flop check fold. This is why I size small. It's fine for me if he folds that. He obviously can have something like pocket tens, like a six seven suited that he doesn't want to build a pot with. Trapping aces every now and then. Checking top set sometimes, right? So it's like really, yeah, what is my strategy there? How much am I stabbing here and how to continue on the turn? Which kinds of, do I rather take my nine ten of hearts and blast it on the turn right if he jams i don't it's fine i'm folding it's not even close or do i take like more equity to barrel because his main answer will just be the check call and i want to maximize my equity against that and so here i'm not sure but i'm aware of the spot and that helps me even more if i now look it up because then i know the spot i know what i thought about and then if I see a result hey I learned something and I will probably have a have a way better life remembering that so here big land versus button here broadway board range bet so yeah I know how to defend here what to check raise pocket fives can actually sometimes check raise but very very low frequency just it's a nice boat draw let's it that way definitely check calling he c-bets all kinds of ace highs that he's planning to check down i beat those that's the plan i need him to check down ace 10 now i win and now the hand is over okay let's get number 30 in here queen eight off actually a fine blind versus blind, medium frequency, and this is spot number 30. So big blind versus small blind, 3-bet pot, trade off board. So we have hearts, which is good blocking some backdoors. We don't have diamonds, which is bad. We have an overcard to the jack, which is good. We have an overcard to the 7, which is good. I think we can see that that I use two sizings on that board, small and big. I'll start with a small one here. We have some options that we barrel and turn. So yeah, obviously super happy to get the fold. And yeah, let's actually wrap it up here. I hope you enjoyed that one. And maybe you can do the same exercise yourself by just finding out what are the spots that you are actually playing here. Because that speaking it out loud it's yeah it's incredible how much how much it can help to raise your awareness to actually apply what you have learned about certain spots that you like do not misapply things because so often it's like i have to excuse myself for like oh i played something here and then i look it up and like what did i like i probably thought this and that and then i figured out okay probably i was just like tentabling and not really aware of the situations so yeah i hope you like that one and try it out so yeah it was a blast have a good one guys
