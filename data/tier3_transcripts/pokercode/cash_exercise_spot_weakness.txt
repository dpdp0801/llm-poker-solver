### TOPIC: cash exercise spot weakness
 All right, again, that part here. Another live play with an exercise. So we have one clear session focus today that I want to focus on. This is a tough one, so I'm a little excited already, but the most fun one at the same time. My goal for today is to hammer on weakness. Whenever I'm really looking for those spots, whenever I find weakness, we go crazy, go crazy no matter our hand right it's about getting a feeling for those spots about spotting weakness in our real sessions we are not hammering on that necessarily we pick the right spots that's the goal but it's about that even subconscious we want to spot those weaknesses where we have a chance to just go crazy from time to time like where do we think there are spots where people are betting a certain size and then we'll fold a hundred percent so yeah let's see whether we get some spots i'm really really excited for this one and you know what since you see the video here i'm pretty sure we found some spots if not i can just click the delete button and try again but for now actually this is the first try let's see queen 10 offsuit here cut off open is not a weakness so let's go this will be mainly about post flop so i try to click through as many preflop hands as possible to just increase my chances trying to win pots this This is, could be red line, not necessarily, because it doesn't mean that I need to call against people who have it, like here against that. Have you seen like how snap that four bad was like either that person did a session focus on four betting already or he had it right. I think it just very very unlikely that he snapped four bats his frequency bluffs there with pocket kings i can see him snapping all right here definitely board here i'm cheating against that guy usually i'm just half potting but my hand especially is interested in betting bigger so i'm just doing that playing a two street game here jamming most turns against that guy is a little crazy and doesn't believe me anything so that should work out if he has seven sixes fives this is the perfect turn card i was looking for i just need to dodge nines and tens which you should against my sizing mainly jam on the flop so yeah this is not a sign of weakness i'm just cheating a little with my exact hand instead of playing a range play really that squeeze up top is definitely no weakness either i'm just called for betting my my range not my full yeah standard getting it through and the king age8 wins through as well. So first thing here those pocket nines against a I don't know what type of player who min bets twice right? No read, no nothing. Here I just don't know whether it is weakness and my hand is just one that just wants to call. This would be something to write down. If I'm full of shit I might even try here here and just bluff him off. But my 9, I can see him bet a random 6 here. I expect king 10 now, but pocket deuces, right? So I didn't need to bluff, but this is something to write down. Next time he minbets, we go for it relentlessly. Here, normal bet against that guy. Okay, he's an insane station against me. But he's kind of playing face up so this is another spot that i would like to attack just by check raising because i see this type of player just over betting right it's like looking for the dog that is not barking kind of right so if you know that from sherlock holmes it's like sometimes you can you can solve things by just because something was not there all right so google for that maybe here I would expect him to overbet aces there all day long and sevens as well on that turn so it's just very very likely that he has something weaker than that so it makes more sense to attack that here I don't want to bluff catch against him that was not the plan here against a random donk actually without time bank i'm retrying so so far we had the one bb bet we definitely want to want to attack that to the maximum right i was lucky with my not i mean lucky we were unlucky with the nines that i couldn't go crazy and just click the call button and here against the big donk from that guy top right i'm just checking down here right i think it's actually a good spot to not go crazy i'm not sure how it plays like his a6 my king jack might be good enough for a value bet i expect lots of queen jack jack 10 and maybe something like king 8 from him he has random pocket fours so again random big donk all right right and don't actually small versus cut off random big dong for four on ace king three give up after so next one easy one to attack and if I didn't have King Jack again we could have tried his queen ace King highs I play with a bigger bet. Ace-Jack high, he has the two pairs himself, so I go for a smaller one. Here, this is one that I often just overbet one and done to just get rid of his King-10, King-Queen type of things, even though I have no equity at all. I block Ace-10, Ace-9, which call 100's one of those yeah bullshit hands, but actually like talking about weakness He snap called that flop that was never a trap ever So just like spotting something like that Can make your turn bluffs a little better if he was like tanking there for 20 seconds thinking about something probably randomizing makes sense to just like be a little more cautious. Right here top left weakness in the sense of having a 34 big blind stack with like super passive random stats here and this is something I would have squeezed here because Welsh Gods can't do anything against me he cannot bluff for bad because he needs to call off that guy who might just randomly jump in with pocket seven I don't know. something I would have squeezed here because Welsh gods can't do anything against me. He cannot bluff for bad because He needs to call off that guy who might just randomly jump in with pocket sevens So that would have been a spot where we increase our frequency here just because of the situation. I mean, I'm forced to call him off Seeing a seven then would suck but That's okay. That's so Would have won not Not that it matters. Alright, ace-5 on a board that he shouldn't see that too often. 3-4 connectivity just very very good for me. Not much equity to be denied so a nice check by him. I can start with small and big sizing against people. This is a board where you don't check raise really, but even though against people who are never check raising and I mean it's correct on that board, but anyways, I like to have like, um, good equity and bigger hands and just the bigger sizing. This is one here against some players I would like going crazy here. For a 13-10 guy, it doesn't mean too much. It just usually means he hits the ace and I'm not trying to move him off an ace. In other spots where that means something, I have a middle peer and don't know any better, then it's the perfect spot. checking back here can mean anything I'm unblocking spades and hearts so I'm just trying to fold something out like king nine of hearts that he didn't bet with that block bet with this combo here obviously any peer should snap me off he shouldn't call me with too many ace highs. Get called by what is it? Ace six of hearts. Okay that sucks a little. I hear that king ten bottom right. I'm not betting here. I would bet little weaker broadways against this double check just because I'm still dominating jack ten and queen ten and king nine king eight and yeah I don't know what happened now that it's snap check check I probably misclicked on some of the hotkeys but so you see how he checked his Jack 8 all the way exactly that hand category I dominate a lot of those hands so actually there's good stuff happening for my King 10 seeing one river card instead of just getting called by king jack and king queen high so 984 aboard that villain from under the gun shouldn't see that big i'm defending quite tight i have nines eights and fours that is already enough to to have like decent nuts in my range that big sizing just usually means strength and it's like more okay jack's tens something like that wants to deny equity while my draws are calling anyways that's correct but I'm not drawing too much now with like what I'm sorry what yeah what my what my exploit there is really to do lots of donking on the turn because his range is rather face up if the turn card hits me it's just like the three is just it's like me check raising and now having that card I just need to give up that kind of suck And here bottom right is just like there can't be more weakness than checking around. So this is a spot We're like over bluffing. They're not interesting. He might be sitting on a six The other guy might be sitting on a random pocket. They are not interested in the pot. I Might turn pocket deuces and threes there into a bluff. All right. Four, six. That's interesting. This Genuchi guy is super tight. I think I built the pot in a way I keep the lead and see how he reacts and try to build exactly the pot size I want to get against like ace queen, queen jack type of hands. On ace-six-four I'm definitely check-raising here. Ace-five-silver, I don't unknown. This can be anything. This is too big to continue for that stack death. Lots of pocket kicks so far. People play okay, right? We have spotted that weird min bet in the beginning. We have spotted that third pot in position by that one guy who is just such a nit and probably just bet small with his ace to get called i'm continuing here with my kings just thinking about whether i want to size up slightly but i think small is good enough and yeah and we've seen the big size on 983 which i mean you can play that it's just like very very tough to stay balanced jacks unfortunately are a fold here against that jam he's not jamming 100 of ace king with like not being involved so far at all so So actually I think this is a king's plus spot and this might be a spot where if he calls because for him it's a king's plus spot for sure when he calls I have an aces only spot. Yeah should be pretty clear. I want to see it but okay. Okay. Alright, so... Dammit. Want to defend very light against the mid open of the bad player who stacked off a 7 off for 35 picks before you have faced so far if he just turned a 10 he turned a 10 and this is a nice river card. 10-6 of spades. Just trying to see he has a c-bet in position of 76 this can be weakness on boards like that where he should check a lot back and then I like to increase my check raise frequency so this can be seen as as one of the spots we were looking for actually betting my king eight here getting the fold okay so we have we have seen that now right if someone c-bets a lot in position and then c-bet small on a board that he shouldn't see you at high frequency it's just very maybe he had just had a correct c-bet right but it's very very likely that he was maybe overdoing it it's five we can mix here call and race i couldn't read i did not three bad pre because he seems super passive and stationing so ace five studio is not the one i want to blow up a pot with and now i'm actually just checking it down with that with those ace of clubs yeah should have check raised but yeah so randomly half potting there so here queen jack double flush draw board i think the hand is slightly too weak to be over bad jamming which is a thing you could do with Queens here. Yeah, I'm check and then decide whether I'm going to jam and If it goes check check I'm praying for the deuce of clubs. This is an okay card 9 8 gets there Queen 10 which I block and he only has suited and yeah, I think this is a pretty clear big bet for value here and against that guy I just have a very very easy fold if he decides to jam just a freaking passive station more or less good player but just like always tank call so sums it up pretty nicely Queen nine of hearts okay right so against him the jam would have been perfect but i don't want to stack off against king jack and ace jack and yeah play against that mainly so kings versus an under the gun four bat i hate my life a little obviously you can have queens and ace king and everything it's a good spot and I'm just seeing that he's three betting enough. Some people are tight here and I need those queens and ace king at high frequency in their range so happy to stack it off here. Aces this is why I'm not really that happy. Under the gun is under the gun. So actually what I just did on the side was put in his bat sizing in the calculator because it looked pretty odd oddly scrolled in a way so i three bet i go for a small c-bet on that board lots of opportunities for for nice turn cards i'm doing fine on that board i have eights and sevens in the small bind versus cutoff three betting range so not that this would be a big problem there and oh some this is a bet here i messed up but no i cannot make up for it and then on the river he bets this amount into 53 which looks like it's 63 point something percent which freakingly looks like a 70 or a 66 button and a scroll down which is usually a sign of weakness which it's it's overdoing it by a lot my hand is kind of a random he could even turn peers into a bluff here so i cannot really call that i could call against like king jack of hearts type of hands. Wow, ice king is getting killed. Yeah, so this is something where I could consider jamming with the correct hands. If I get to that spot with like 9-10, I can take that as a reason, as a sign of weakness. Even if I maybe have the note that he bets large when he's interested or scrolls up or something like that I have those notes here somewhere on some people and then this can be again the dog that didn't bark can be a sign so if he doesn't scroll up it has to mean the opposite he cannot scroll down and up with with nuts at the same time Alright, pot size seems strong to me after taking a pot turn. Okay nice. So even here I have the note he sizes pot on the turn and then sizes down on the river to a half pot with busted full shit so I give that actually some extra strength here if he uses the half pot as a bluff. Recreational players so that's that's makes it pretty easy yeah those pocket fives here a low frequency continue now this is where our river bluffs come from if he decides to check back and now i have ace 10 i have this i have that he has ace jack ace 10 ace king i think he has actually more aces than I have ace-10, I have this, I have that. He has ace-jack, ace-10, ace-king. I think he has actually more aces than I have. So I'm checking protect my... I mean it's kind of a... I mean everything is a straight here so... Let's take that as a check. I mean I'm unblocking all his kind of two pair hands and this is like no one's trying to get me off the chop like i mean it's hurting so much you can just do that with everything right the thing is that raising is always better than calling in those kind of spots so if i decide to bluff catch i should be raising because then i don't expect to get called by the split ever Let's try that. Nice. So it's really maybe one learning from here that small sizing was actually weak here and right it's like if I call I'm only playing for half the pot and if I in so it's like I'm paying what is it not the plan of the video but it's a very very interesting spot. He has an ace or he's full of shit but full of shit means he has a straight so i have the option between i can choose between two options i'm either investing five to have a chance to win like 20 or i invest 10 uh no the half of 20 obviously or i invest 10 to have the to win the full 20. And if I'm saying that he only calls ace-axe there because why should he against the after betting, why should he ever call just to play the board against a check raise, then just the the bet is superior. I buy the second half of the pot for five dollars if my bluff catch is correct. So yeah pretty nice when that happens. It's just nice pot. Looks obviously stupid if he has an ace, but then it's like a very very low risk reward. And again something to note down as weakness. That was not planned. That was just a hotkey from streaming. all K95, someone checks here on a board that he can almost see that full range means something again. Can be a 9, can be A8, can be 8-7-6s. This is a very bad run out. I'd expect him to turn 8-7-6s into into a bluff so I'm not beating anything and To bluff there you need to start checking your ace-high steer in the first place Alright, so let's actually wrap it up here or go two three more minutes. Maybe we get one more spot Pocket sevens against a seven dollar three bet from a nit definitely set mining here I'm not looking at the chart and playing any frequency or something But have to follow up with just no set no bet if he doesn't make it super small and potentially plays his ace king like that or turning a seven. Alright so now we hope for the big bet to have that jacks plus but I actually give him lots of ace king that's why i call this is where my value comes from from the flop call and now yeah that's that looks pretty decent and i play like six seven of spades in his eyes i say he has 5.93 bet he just has an over pair all the time not having bluffs before i time out i just check jam no reason to do like some fancy small check raising whatever don't see queen's king's aces folding ever this is the majority of his range a six eight and spade kill my action so yeah even though he folds now his flush draw or whatever maybe this is the clearly superior play against that type of player or he's super lucky that my stats for on 400 hands are just very very wrong Thank you. superior play against that type of player. Or he's super lucky that my stats on 400 hands are just very very wrong. And it's just like not playing 17, 14, 5. This is interesting. Top right someone raising and then checking back that 4. I go for a block bet. I don't know what against but don't want to check all the big bet really and maybe i mean he seems to be super random so far raise check back is that like some ace ten of spades i'm i'm looking this one up this is just too random i don't even know what it should be is it ace four of spades like i really don't know and yeah when i don't know i'm just like i'm calling off correctly somewhat and it's ace four of spades okay this is one hand that makes somewhat sense obviously it doesn't right it's like the clearest turn barrel of all times it's not like like the four gives him showdown value. But yeah. Like, wow. Those sessions are, I mean, the whole day, like actually I'm recording that after maybe you've seen it, the one stream where I just like kept losing everything. But it's kind of a fun day when things go like that. It's really the only, like ace four of spades. Why is he raising the flop is the question why is he then checking back the turn the turn doesn't change anything if he doesn't have a four river is another four and now he decides to raise again so this brings us back to the four but which freaking four is raising on the flop all right here we go ace four of spades maybe even four or five of spades but yeah cool anyways yeah i think that showed quite well even though there weren't like big spots where i could decide to go crazy we have seen min bets we have seen big dongs that were weak we have seen sizings in position that were weak by just like trying to sneak away with like the the the chop pot with this kind of stuff we have talked about the dog that doesn't bark if you have to note that someone is face up over batting value what does it mean if he doesn't over bat in the same spot in the next hand right it's usually not the strongest hands in the world and those reads need to be confirmed over and over again in some other spots you can go with more like population reads i didn't find too many of those in this session today but yeah as always discuss those hands in the channels tell me what your plan was try those exercises it's it can be fine right even go if if you think okay it's it's maybe you're playing slightly minus every now and then drop drop a little in the stakes that you can kind of afford it and really you learn so much by making a small mistake you can take great spots maybe the next time to get that confirmed, right? I think I had two hands at least now where I could call villain's exact hand again like that ace four of spades even though i was calling because it is ace four of spades or super random and a guy that was running around with like 50 30 stats so far is like in my eyes was more likely to be super random so i was just like looking him up but yeah that's that's like how we improve over time all right good luck at the tables and until the next one
