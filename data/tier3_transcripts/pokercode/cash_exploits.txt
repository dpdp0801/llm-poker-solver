### TOPIC: cash exploits
 Let's see, give me a little welcome in the chat, everyone who is here already. First six, seven people in here. I hope everything is running smoothly. You see the Kahoot. There won't be too much quizzing today because I'm more presenting stuff and there's not much that I could put in there to really ask questions. So it's more like a little brainstorm to interact with me there. Make sure anyways to just jump in makes things easier than just reading the chat if you're new in here don't be shy just give me a little high in the chat maybe i see your your name for the first time you could get a little shout out make sure to join the kahoot it's as easy as it looks just put in www.kahoot.it in your browser or your phone or something and put in the game pin. That's all you need. Time to exploit. Yeah, let's see. Let's see how good that is working. All right. So Tucker, here we go. You've dedicated your days to my content. Just finished watching the three bad pots out of position. I'm not sure whether we have an exploit really working on there, but I did one in my latest session that was just half an hour ago so yeah maybe maybe i will mention that at some point it was a pretty fancy one well nevermore 86 you joined poker code today and you are here in the coaching right away seems like stuff is working out for you so make sure to stay active in discord the others will help you anyways and great to see you in the first coaching for you here how's the grind going now i just posted a little update it's tough like i feel better every freaking day just knowing more exactly what we will talk about it's not just like trying to play good for me right now it's just really like putting people in groups and playing as good as possible against them to boost my win rate i stopped posting for like three days or so because it doesn't isn't it just isn't fun to just like keep whining about bad results i think like i'm i don't know like 20 stacks under ev the last five days like i got in the exploit i was talking about the three bad prod i just got in with the other 80 again but i i refuse to run it twice so i i keep running it once even though it is not working out for me so far but yeah there's not too much to complain it's doing all right evbb could be way better so i'm not happy i'm not sure how to evaluate that with the 5bb rake i'm paying so i guess i have like two to three evbb so far over the whole challenge Thank you. So I'm not happy. I'm not sure how to evaluate that with a 5BB rake I'm paying. So I guess I have like two to three EVBBs so far over the whole challenge. And I'm looking like I would be happy with like five to six. If I add the rake that I'm paying of 5BB, I mean, I'm beating the pool right now, total of like seven bigs, which should be more. I'm pretty convinced of. So it's still a huge variance on that sample just having those 20 stack swings so yeah i think it's like 60k hands now but it's really one day 22 stacks down another one 20 stacks up and just like the fact that i'm 20 stacks under ab or even more just shows how much swing swang swung there is it's like really uh just give me another big day and everything is good give me bad and everything looks shit so yeah i think my play in the beginning was like definitely had more variance because i was making like high variance moves against players that i now don't want to do that against anymore we will talk a lot about that today so yeah i think it should get a little less swingy just by like picking up more clear EV in small hands where there's low variance. So that's actually the plan. And in the big spots, I actually need to stay value heavy against most players. So that should take away some of the variance, like having those, I don't know, I still need very very thin value bets but like those bluff jams and stuff yeah so let's see how many people we got in here now 26 how's the rakeback challenge i'm at like 72 73 done i will not play from friday to sunday maybe sunday. I'm away over the weekend and next weekend as well. And then I'm a week in Vienna looking more to play maybe higher stakes on GG poker from Austria. So it's actually, I need to get things done the next week, Monday to Friday. So that was pretty much the pace I was looking for to not get into trouble in the end. So it looks like I'm super easily through, but given my personal personal schedule i think it's just super easy yeah it's actually fun yeah i can share that i will i will probably stay some time with tobias dutweiler so i guess the best german cash gamer right now maybe even grind from his office and i told him before that i'm like putting in some karma here to then run back on on stakes to run good there. So I told him to better get an AC going for sure, because the heater will be real in the office. So I'm prepared for that 20 stack upswing on 5k then. All right, five plus three. I guess we can get things going. So I give you another 30 seconds for everyone to jump into Kahoot. So again, maybe I'll write it in the chat again, game pin 4908164. Make sure if you are not in here, because I will start with the presentation now until we get to the point of the first question. As always, we have the headline here today, my biggest exploits, right? So I write down the date and the pool I'm talking about, because usually I love to make content that will stay true all the time. When we talk about theory, you can watch pretty much all the videos in 10 years and everything will be correct. Maybe we can add even more details after some time, like solvers get more correct and stuff, and we know maybe a little better, but I try to make that content in a way that everything is correct. I'm not saying what works and what is not working. This is what we are actually talking about today a little. So it's really important to understand that I'm talking about the pool I am playing in and the time, right? If maybe you watch that video here in one year from now, then make sure to take that into account as well. So yeah, this is the plan. And we'll start as always, just like having a little overview of what we will be talking about. We'll talk a lot about who to exploit. There's not one Zoom 200 player. There are different kinds of groups. We'll talk about common mistakes that we are just seeing very shortly and the potential exploits they lead to. This is something we should always have in our mind. And then I will show you my personal top five exploits I do right now when I sit down on the table. I was like really actually discussing with some friends as well. Like I made that kind of random headline, like topics last night, let's make a freaking list. But it was really fun to think about what are actually my maybe most used and maybe favorite exploits as well. To then wrap it up with key takeaways, what can you take away from that? And now I guess time to start the Kahoot, as always with a little brainstorm. I want to hear your thoughts to maybe navigate a little differently through the coaching, depending on what I'm reading here. So let's just start things here. We'll start with a brainstorm and the very, very easy question that should be shown here in a second. When do you exploit? When, who, how? Just give me some input. What do you need that you exploit? When do you do it? When do you realize you're exploiting someone? Anything that comes to mind, anything helps me. Just try to make like, I don't know, keywords or full sentence, just like something I can work with. Just really think it through. I know 120 seconds is a lot of time, but really make use of it. It was not the easiest coaching to prepare, I had to say, because it's often like really, yes, I'm doing something and we call it exploitative, but really writing it down is a very, very tough part. But this is where you learn a lot. Like what are we actually trying to do? All right. Three, two, one, let's go. Okay. So we got the first thing, right? So let's, I got to repeat the three questions I'm always asking here. What would be right is what we worked on in pretty much most of the coachings, not today. Today we're talking about question number three, what is the right exploit? And the first thing I see here is obviously question number two, we need to find out when villain is doing something wrong. Once we find that out, this is time to exploit. You cannot exploit without knowing what someone is doing wrong or a population is doing wrong. It's always, there is a certain mistake and that leads to an exploit. There cannot be an exploit without a mistake that you have seen or know or can expect or whatever, right? This is just not working. So whenever you talk about exploits, try to combine those two things. What is villain doing wrong? What is the right exploit then? Wrong. When we have reads on villain, right? Reads means he does something wrong or differently than the standard. When we know the baseline, no villain is deviating from it, he does something differently. Perfect. Actually, this grouping works nicely nicely today we have strong indication that villain is deviating too much from gto or he has no clue what he's doing perfect mistake in the sizing so sizing you can exploit sizings first really clear point that we talk about from what is correct okay this is very general huge sizings with no history start overfolding right here we have that. The villain is betting huge. You are saying this is value heavy and the exploit is to overfold. Straight away, maybe not only with both hands. Exploit the players who are deviating the most. Preflop against knits and high three by overfold, overfold, overfold. Perfect. Relevant stats over a significant sample size. So this is what you use. You have your stats to find out how people are playing, how they are playing wrong to then do something. Not full stack as a read on someone, right? Only certain player types play with a not full stack. That can be a read. Not that playing 50 BB is wrong, but that that player is more likely to play wrong in a certain direction that we have seen before. When I discover obvious mistakes, so we got size again. We categorize players, very nice, very solid read, you know about leagues, very general. If weak players aren't buttoned and big blind, that size is rounded up to an exact big blind overfold. One of the favorite, it won't be in here, it's too special to filter for it, to find hand examples, but you all know that by now, if people scroll up with their mouse wheel so that the $7.28 turned out to be like a $7.50 or even an $8, that's like the strongest thing in the world. Against huge sizes, small bluff would fold out a lot of my range. Yes, at big wind, not at't care about defending too much okay block bet always is unbalanced always is the weekends right do people protect their ranges with like the correct small bet then to re-raise plans or something like that certain tendencies and a theory in the spot very nice the first time talking about that we have to understand the theory first right really referring to my question number one how can we know a mistake right for knowing a mistake we need to know what is right first so it's really that kind of a chain right like we need to know what is right to figure out the mistake of villain to then make use of that by exploiting him and then we have all the examples of different certain types of exploits where I will add more today. Prepared in advanced spots from database reviews or from anything else. Very, very good. Having exploits prepared that you want to put in. This is something I play a session. I want to have a certain mindset. For example, I want to to overfold versus this year today. I want to overfold certain mindset right for example I want to overfold versus this year today I want to overfold in three bad pot spots on the river I want to attack block bets on the river randomly right just to make sure I have enough bluffs this or this or that this is something right really prepared exploits we can have more or less love size up size down close hands We can use our frequency. We can use our certain sizings. All right. Is that scroll wheel something you read into as well? What way do you give it? I give it a huge rate because I have huge sample on that and huge experience. It's something I really take into account quite a lot, especially from players that I have the impression they do it unconsciously it's just they are playing six tables or more what i mean is people are using hotkeys and they click on their 30 button 75 button and what we see then is usually them like this ending up being odd numbers right let's say i make an example even in the chat that everyone can read it here bet flop 2277 into 1008. So there should be 1462 in the middle now on the turn if he calls. And then we add like 731 into 1462, half pot on the turn. And then on the river, we know he has those hotkeys. We have 2924 in the middle. And then he is like betting that even 20 into something like that and it's like he used maybe his hotkey and then he used this sound like just scrolling up this is just the biggest sign of strength you can watch yourself doing it you do it unconsciously it's just yes people are really trying, like you have value, villain will call the same hand. So like no one ever made like $2 more in the pot just to make him fold something. Like it's just not happening. It's like, I don't know, I would say 95% of the time, this is just a sign for strength. Works the same way with scroll down, just that it's happening less often. Scroll down is a little bluff heavy then. Yeah, like try to use your standard sizings. It won't make a difference long-term whether you bet 75% or 77%. If you're 100% sure that this guy is whatever and never cares, yes, you can try to squeeze out that extra coffee. That's okay. Get a dollar more out there. Or I don't know, prices today. We more talk about like $4.50 maybe. So cool. Let's go from there. That's a good starting point. And then let's see what comes next. So again, I just want to, as always, just make sure that we are all talking about the same spot. I did play in the last 10 days, 60K hands in that one Zoom pool pool I see the same players over and over again I was forced to play against all of those and this is where actually let's say the first six seven days I was ready I was not playing max cd not at all I was trying out things as well I was trying to bluff against some people where I knew like okay bluffing is probably not the best idea. Just again, I wanted to put myself into that pool and do not start with having lots of assumptions, making that. It's just like I want to test things and then like still play somewhat reasonable to then know, okay, this is how people play. And then I actually turned around and said like, okay, now I try to exploit that to the maximum. I'm pretty sure how I group i group those players how they play and they are not all like lots of those players are just playing a lot right it's not like they are just looking at me and see how i deviate things and they know after two days that's all bullshit so they have like their play style as i have my play style and maybe mine is even more a little more flexible yeah what i did is really i tried to identify certain player types that I can group together that I'm not sitting there. Okay. I have actually 50 different recs I need to play against. I rather have like three groups, right? And then I can say like, okay, maybe this is even a nation thing, right? I won't be bluffing against Brazilians. I can say that. I won't over bluff against Russians. Maybe, right? It's like, whatever. Or it could be a group where I say like, okay, that's my pink label. And I give the pink label to certain player types. So what I did was really collecting experience on how people react to certain situations. And I have an idea of how I label those spots even. I had small spots where like, okay, they are splitting their range in a wrong way. So only attack the weak part and overfold to the strong part but people always value betting but having a shit checking range for example this is knowing where my ev comes from for example talking about i call them black white spots where it's really like i leverage something big i use a big bet i use a big race where i know villain always has a bluff catcher and he needs to react in a certain frequency given my sizing. But this is very, very tough for human beings. We will talk about that one, that it's just, yeah, looking at the sizing, should I call like 25% only or 40 or maybe even 60% because it's a smaller sizing. It's tough because every time we have that feeling, yeah, it's like 50-50. So it's very, very likely that people have tendencies ending up with like a certain number. Maybe they go with like 50-50. Some are folding always. Some are folding never. And this is just what we need to figure out. And now is pretty much my time. And I'm really a little sad that the last days didn't go too well to go crazy. I think I play brilliant. I have to say that I think I play brilliant right now. I play like a freaking monkey on drugs in that pool. That is my goal because I know exactly how those player types are like playing right now. But it's tough to click the fold button just all the time. So yeah, this is the plan. And now I want to start to show you how I group those players. But first I want to know again, how do you do that? I want to know which player types do you face in your games? Maybe we have similar types. Maybe we have different types. Maybe I forgot one that I want to mention then as well. Which player types? Think about it. Maybe add even what your game is. If someone was in here, I played the same games like you, Stefan. I'm super interested in what your player type categories look like. Or home game every Friday night. How do you categorize your players there? You play $10 MTTs only every Sunday. What is like your typical player feels there? I'm interested. Okay. Seeing how you approach effective note-taking would be great. I have some players with 15 notes because it feels like useful info, but too much to take in within the hand. This is something, this is a big problem. I like writing down those notes. It's like always, maybe we get to that in the end. I can add another five minutes to talk about that, but start with the player groups now 100 and l okay super nits people who don't play back for real don't really bluff only value bet ones who put the pressure on overbats check raises both bluffs and value total donators all right grace aggro passive calling station tricky player like race block but when villain is in position okay loose passive tight passive okay that's the typical things out of the book loose passive tight passive calling station like loose passive describes certain type of stats but doesn't necessarily give me a picture of a player in a way so this is a great start over aggressive okay pass tight aggressive so we see lots of things like lots of that what you learn in the books right passive tight aggressive tight passive maniacs we're like that's the classic poker strategy school or any book in the world which is good stuff hungarian crushers right can find bluffs definitely amateur pro that's a good start as well range bet all range bet russians that's that works well see bet 33 see that every flop guys okay whales in the sense of not folding okay i mean mine are looking pretty much a little in like pretty much in the same direction obviously what i try to do is especially when note taking to really split things up into action and reaction game as well. Because for example, those typical Zoom 200 grinder is like on the one hand, never bluffing, on the other hand, calling every bluff catch once he has a big hand. And then maybe if that's already note-taking, right? People can play differently in big pots and in small pots where the one is the pot they care, the other one is the pot they don't care. Okay. So let's see. I'll just show mine. And what I really like to do, which is my problem with loose passive type passive calling station is I really want to have a picture in mind. So I delivered four pictures for you. And this is pretty much what I went through, what I figured out. This is what I experienced here. So like shout out to everyone who can put out the names of all the four pictures here names of all the people old man coffee yeah that's what you need to to put it let's hide the pain herald we got elkie grinding the first supernova elite we got obviously what's the name again from from the hangover guy i i guess hangover guy gotta gotta get a good account and on the bottom right is uh kevin holmes the runner the, is it Kevin? Definitely Holmes. Yeah, bottom right is second in the last WSOP. So my questions are really to figure out, first, obviously, which player types are there, and there will be even more and different types and different kinds of games. So I focus on Zoom 200 here. How do they think? What do they try to get from the game? What are their goals? And then obviously how to spot them. What do I need to look at to mark someone? So the nice old knit, yes, the overthinker, GTO overvaluer, okay. And the agro fish, right, can be anything. So I just made a little list for all of them. So let's start with the, I call it the recreational knit. He plays premiums only preflop. he falls in love with his hands post-flop though so it's just like your job is to beat aces and then get the whole stack right and he sits there like hide the pain herald and just like is happy about playing kings and aces loving the zoom games because he can just fold quickly everything else and all the indicators we need to spot that guy is vpip pfr three bet and when to showdown right so it's like yes what we see here it's the second line is the important one it's not a stats coaching but i just included some of those where we see vpip 14 we see pfr of eight we see a three bet of 1.5 right this is the type of guy if he min four bats you you can fold kings when to showdown is this year the 41 which is like the standard is between 27 and 31 i would say this year is obviously he always has aces and kings so he always gets to showdown more or less it's literally kingsness and you see this guy maybe if anyone else out there is playing 200 this is table gorp These are all people i took out of real life i played 3 000 hands with him would 50 hands be enough yes if you then see 14 8 and probably zero here yes if he three bets me and i have pocket aces i only have one answer and that is the jam there is no folding range i i don't want to give him a chance to fold his hand to only trap with kings and then there's an ace high board or something like that. So it's two things. We fold to them. We call hands that can beat his kings or aces. And when we have him, we need to make sure to get the money in now. Again, some of you, or I've seen that somewhere, I guess, and I don't know whether it was in Discord, was referring to an interview I gave somewhere else where I explained an exploit I was doing against that type of player. It was like, I call a three bet with five, six suited. Typically they three bet too small. Flop is eight, seven, four with my flush draw. And they bet big. You can learn as much Pio as you want. The only right answer is to freaking jam your hand because he has 0% fold now, but on a five, on a six, on a third flush card, or maybe the third, like one card straight card, you won't get the stack anymore, right? Then maybe even hide the pain. Harold takes his coffee and puts this over his laptop and it's like, the fun right so it's like here we want him to be like ah unlucky again i put him on a flush draw or just like he has aces let's let's get it in so it's like the easiest one and there's not much to talk about because it's so obvious i see them on a daily basis and it's not important to make money against them it's important to make make the maximum money. There's only one raise frequency in the small blind. If that guy is in the big blind, it's a hundred percent, maybe even with different sizings, you can min raise. I talk so much about it. It's so important to really, as you say, throw GTO out of the window. However, you are often 200, 300 deep still seems good to jam. Yes, obviously he won't three bad bad fold his kings but there might be other things that i don't get the money in the middle all right let's get to the next one the old school mass tabler i added the old school i thought about actually is the title just mass tabler grinder rakeback grinder or old school it's like really because in the zoom 200 pool it's i see so many players that played like seven years ago with me, those pools, where I clearly know this is the end of their career. They reach what, I don't know whether they don't have the capability in a way they are not trying to go higher, or maybe they are living somewhere where they are freaking king with the reg pack money they make from NL 100 and 200. So it shows us as well that by me knowing most of the players still from years ago is really just showing, okay, they are not willing to put thoughts into their game really anymore. They play like their charts. So how I characterize them here is they play chart poker more or less pre-flop, but they forget the non-ure place this is why they are too tight especially we will talk about three bets right it's like especially the big blind that will be one of the favorite exploits definitely they don't have that right if they see 10-7 suited big blind versus button they click the call and then they play their hand post flop they under bluff every spot who never has seen a solver in his life and has like the game of five years ago is incredibly under bluffing and pretty much their image is like what they think it be in their head is really what i think is my i grind here all day and wait to receive presents from from from fish in their eyes they are not really making mistakes i mean we're talking on a certain level someone who plays 2017 on l200 is probably like break even is not a horrible poker player but leaves infinite room for for exploits so here the indicators i mentioned here regarding the the stats is again vpip pfr is in the like normal low region we We have fold versus four bet that will be probably, yeah, okay. Because they have standard three bets values, but maybe a little different from the big line. The fold versus five bet is way too low for all of them. They maybe fold like 15% against five bets because they do not four bet bluff. Their win to showdown is incredibly low because they know how to fold. And their $1 when seen flop is incredibly low relatively as well. So around 50 is the standard. It's like most pots are heads up. So when you see the flop, you should win about like 50%. And the last is $1 when bet river. This is a very, very special stat that you can use when you have some sample. But it's one of the mightiest stats that are there. It just means that whenever this guy bets the river, how often did he win at showdown? Very, very easy stat where you need rivers for it. But here you can think about, okay, 50% is the correct answer to my question that I didn't ask yet. It's how much equity or how often do you need to win when getting called when you are value betting? And so the thinnest value bet is a value bet when it gets called by 50%, right? Worse hands. So 50% is for that reason, not necessarily the perfect answer for that $1 after bad river. Actually, I don't know what the perfect thing is here, but we have, I guess, a range in that player pool from 45 to 80, which if we compare that to different stats where everyone plays the same, and this is like, this is just the truth. Is someone bluffing or not, right when he always wins this year's the last number in that second row that's where everyone plays the same and this is like this is just the truth is someone bluffing or not right when he always wins this year is the last number in that second row that's 73 here if someone wins 73 he's not only not bluffing he's not value betting thinly either it's just insane it's just like i play like a 49 i guess on that sample and yeah it's it's like and is a big indicator for especially the spots that come up more often right this year is just a number that river win or not where obviously small pots come up way more often so this is an indicator is someone fighting for small pots or not at all so against that guy you don't need to call a single delayed bet with a bluff catch. You need some sample for that. But for me, it's about the overall picture. If someone plays like 26-21 here, this is probably because of sample then. That wouldn't fit together. All things together just make a very, very nice picture. The stats after VPIP. Just VPIP, PFR, 3-bet, fold to 3-bet, went to show to showdown one dollar when seen flop and this is the one dollar bet river next line is the positional race first in so we see standard from under the gun standard from mp 24 is very tight from the cutoff 35 is incredibly tight from the button 43 is kind of standard from the small blind and those numbers are actually oh this is just a flop line that i just added recently and i don't even know myself i guess like c-bet fall to c-bet check raise something like that or but i only have in the pop-up i just rebuilt my hut a little starting from from scratch with like now adding more sample over time after playing a while i don't want to have stats included that i am not using or i cannot use because of sample. All right. So maybe that is a little hint for people using stats or on sites that can use stats, but still you can try to understand how people play. If you see someone giving up four high blind versus blind in a spot where he should always bluff, perfect. Probably in that group. If he is tight as well, probably in that group group yesterday someone who button versus big blind checked down his six high on like an ace 10 four something board where i would have folded more than 80 against the river bet he decided to check back his six high that was pretty decent so stuff like that can just show you even through just like three four or five showdowns I start usually taking those notes, maybe like old school mass tabler question mark. Then I change it to like probably old school mass table. And then at some point I'm like pretty sure. All right, let's get to the next one. I call the upcoming wizard, right? I like having that slight overconfidence just for giving me some room for really trying to exploit people. It's just bad when you play in a pool and you're saying yeah they are really great, these are great players etc. This is nice in interviews after some tournaments but for playing at the table your goal is to play better than people so you need to play better and this is the talk I want to have whenever I talk about people as well. This here is the only part where I'm saying, okay, let's acknowledge that Zoom 200 on PokerStars is kind of a tough limit. There are good players, especially these days, because it's tough to move up the ranks. There's way less action on mistakes. I remember seven years back, there were like 20 tables of NL 600 running nonstop that you could like choose nicely from. So there are some good players. They probably grew up poker wise in the solver era now in the last two, three years. So they have a very, very great foundation of their game and they know how to like figure out things that maybe they lack a little experience or something but that's about it right so i took my brazilian friend pe123 draw here he's actually like a pretty decent good player with we see the stats very very different to the to the type player before right again just try to to remember that line slightly 2017-8 73 win after river bats 24-21 12.53 that is like going going to the roof not folding to three bats pretty high went to showdown i guess this will not hold over sample one dollar when seen flop of 52 instead of 44 really if you think like most pots are heads up it's like yeah 52 means you you means you win more pots and 44 means, yeah, you give up a lot. And 53 is just like, yes, we will sometimes find bluffs. So pretty much how those people grew up is just like learning charts, learning PIO, having solutions. This is my assumption, right? So they play all really well pre-flop. This year is chart poker, right? 18, 21, 30, 42. Small blind, maybe some additional exploits, right? Tries to loosen up when possible is what I write here. So if he plays against me, I expect him to have more like 45 in the small blind, but he's capable of doing those any two open races maybe. Then he tries to follow the solver with added aggression, right? It's like that okay having that overconfidence i have myself right i could put myself in like the the old school wizard maybe in that group we're like i try to fuck people up left and right because i just like have that over overconfidence so that ends up in him like over bluffing lots of spots that are good to over bluff against the pool and stationing especially especially against me. He sees my name. He knows my name. He clicks on the call button when he has a black white decision. Just yesterday, he made a zero percent call, like zero percent payo call, where I decided it was a big mistake what I've done there because I was actually bluffing in a spot where this was just my necessary bluff. and I couldn't go to 0% bluffing. But okay. So their attitude should be something like, I'm smarter than everyone, and I'll play all of them. I feel like I've heard that before. I don't know. It can be the thing. And there, the problem is really that this is, in the end, just really, really good poker up to a certain point. Maybe there are some mistakes in there that we need to figure out. This is why I added lots of stats here. We need to combine them, find something. He's having two to three betting, but actually is not over-folding to four betting, right? It's like he's not folding versus four bets because he knows that you can call four bets. He is folding to five bets correctly, right? Because he has his bluffs himself. He is check raising. Okay, let's double check that check raise. It's that eight here. 8% check raise. We got a 27 here. I mean, this has to be simple, but I can see him having a 21, which is like insane. I bet everyone in the chat here has less than 15. So fold to check check raise of 27 is very interesting as well. Yeah, fold to check raise is like, yeah, 27 is really, really low. He doesn't like to get pushed around. He's calling, he is bluffing. It's like, you need to have it to win hands against him, to win money against him. So, $1 when seen flop, you see that he's over 50, means he is fighting for pots. He wants to win more than belongs to him. All right, $1 bad river, you see that as well. Okay, compared to that 73 before, we will find some bluffs. So this is pretty much good poker, but maybe there are some spots where this year can be some trouble. I know that because I experienced that myself. I tried to bluff, even though people are not folding. He's still trying to bluff, even though the range hits me, like the cards hit me, whatever. Trying to outsmart people, doing fancy things, maybe trying to induce anything is possible. That's group number three. Let's go to group number four. And I did not really categorize that. I just called it the freaking fun player. So we have someone here again, 1,300 hands. We have a 55, 33, not three betting too much. I could post anyone here. We got an interesting 58% from under the gun, probably having Olympic statue on the cutoff, or I don't know, like 1,300 hands should be enough sample for a race. Oh, sorry, this is, no, this is race first in. I got lost here. So he doesn't care about positions that's what we see here 56 45 53 71 54 he likes the button but everything else he plays the same hands like top 50 nice so with recreational usually they are loose when it's not the recreational knit randomly aggressive that we need to figure out let's have have some fun. Indicators can be everything. So now to understand for everyone who asked already for note-taking, these are our big note-taking victims. This is what we need to do because here any note can win us a full stack, for example. We can have a sizing tell have timing tails we can have anything right lots of people are min check raising and then potting as like the strongest line on earth right this is what they do and this is something we should know but what is when they use half pot is it always a bluff is it medium value what is it if they block bet the river do they fold then with their medium shit or do they call always? It's like I have, for example, lists with like where I write down block bet folds river and then I add like I just write it in the chat as well. Block bet folds river and just write it down five out of five times. That's so something like everything they they do do just means something they are usually playing one table and trying their best in their fun way with their goals there so it's really this is and there's so much to figure out which hotkeys they click how much time they need whatever right so this is where we write notes all the regs play somewhat reasonable and grouping makes a lot of sense but fun player is what everyone is grouping this is a recreational he's bad but this is where i want to focus on note taking just every note can be worth more this is where the money comes from in the end this is where our focus should be okay so this is the first group and this is the one we really want to dig deeper into when it comes to note taking. It's just something that we cannot prepare as well for because they are not all alike. Okay, so I guess next thing is just me talking openly about some points that I think are people doing wrongly in the Zoom 200 pool or like are my standard exploits going in there to then show you really detailed five exploits that I do every single session probably. Common mistakes, potential exploits. Already here, I split it up in action game and reaction game. So action game means we are setting the parameters. We are thinking about betting. We are c-betting. We are double-barreling. We are thinking about river bluffing. We make the sizing decision. We make the frequency decision. All on us, right? So the very standard thing that we talked about in lots of sessions already is that people let us over-realize equity. That will lead to us having smaller bets and using higher frequency. People are not raising. We talked about that in the lesson about how much should people check raise. Pedro was not the one we were talking about there. It was the people who check raise 8%. So we over-realize equity. People are not three betting enough from the big blind. So we can open raise from the small blind, looser, and sizings and well we always see a flop pretty much this is the right answer if we just make that assumption so general but this is what is happening people do overfold in small pots right again that leads to us having small bats high frequency Do they know against small bets how wide they need to defend? Again, we can say, okay, they are probably defending too wide with check calling, which again means we are over-realizing equity. So it's really kind of a standard go-to approach already to use lots of those good risk rewards, which means small sizing in all the small pots. Try, try, try, try, try here, try there. And then once things get big, it might change. And then this is what I said already, pretty much. People don't react to sizings. So that leads obviously not to like, I'm always betting big for value and small as bluffs, but we definitely can overbluff small pots where people are not interested. And then there are spots where people show big interest. And well, maybe sometimes if you check that in a solver, something like a bottom set is a pure bluff catcher and can be a fold. A flush can be a fold. And this is where people are bad in. And this is where we use big sizings. If I bet three the pot will and should fold 75 of the time maybe he's just folding 50 and then it's a big risk to just bluff there ever kind of this is something we will get to as well it's per three but out of position video in position over fault versus time that's including myself absolutely correct like one term, which is balanced by the pool, because against the pool, it's often just correct to overfold, because they start off with stronger ranges than they should, especially talking about the three bet spot here. So this is something, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Let's say we check down to the river, and I block bet as a bluff, like 80% of the time I i have a bluff probably but again it is balanced by the pool the next 10 times villains call there they look into a second pair just like okay i have the problem i would love to test everything now with an unknown account i think against me i like i see lots of calls that i'm 100 sure just because of looking of looking at the stats that people won't make those as a standard. Jerome, yes, I agree 100%. Jerome is saying, I feel like people are very sensitive to sizing on the flop, but less and less on later streets. So fold a ton versus flop overpads, but not in river. Yes, I agree 100%. Depends a little on how strong the reads are. Sometimes I think it's good to be very, very sensitive on the flop just because it means something. But versus the river bet, just think about yourself when you write down a hand history or you talk to someone. How do you explain it? Yeah, he c-bets the flop, maybe not even mentioning the sizing. Then he barrels the turn, maybe again not mentioning the sizing. And And then he overbets the river. Again, not mentioning the sizing, just saying it's an overbet. What's the difference between 150% and 300%? It's a massive difference, but people just don't make that in their head. Is it a massive difference between 25% and 30% on the flop? Probably not. So this is something really to take into account, right? Even when you talk about hands, try to be more precise. Lots of players use now the whole line. Like he bets 30 into 75 into 150. I know all the lines. Like I know he triple barrels. I know his sizings. And this is what I can evaluate. Where it's like, he goes pot, pot, three times pot all in. All right, I have an impression. And this, when using that, you start thinking about it right away. Severino, that's the problem I had, maybe still have, that I always assume people fold way too much versus 100% plus bets on the river, leading me towards using smaller sizings, especially betting into cap ranges. Yes, that's the most ridiculous thing in the world. remember one thing i was in brigands in august with some buddies that were going to play w coop i don't know whether it was joseph simonich stefan schilhaber julian thomas some of that german group and i was railing them playing some tournaments while i was playing cash on the side and i was like mind blown after someone said like yeah that spot where he just had the nuts and villain like had a capped range but was always sitting on a bluff catcher and he decided to bet like two-thirds pot on the river where he had like 200 left i'm like there's only one sizing it's like there's only one sizing what the fuck are you doing there there's really's really only one sizing. And then he's like, yeah, but then he would never call. Like maybe you have that feeling, but then I come up with a follow-up question and just ask him, how often did you bluff that spot for 200% of the pot? But if you say he never calls, you should bluff your full range there. Obviously the answer was,, you are right, never. These guys crash those tournaments. Yes, indeed. Because often they are actually right with that. They should just then bluff that shit as well. So this is something where just like you can test yourself, right? Whenever you decide to not bet big for value because you think they are never calling, just double check, are you bluffing that exact same exact same spot and if you do you will find out and you will complain how they can ever call that trust me right actually i mean this is now assume 200 pool i'm very very certain that people are calling too much in those pure bluff catching spots all right so let's get to the reaction game people are value heavy. There is the easy theory that just says, okay, if you have a value bet and you have a nice hand on the river you bet right it's just like it's easy right but taking the correct bluffs is tough right you are scared of bluffing you might get called whatever so you will never miss a value bet maybe some of the thinner ones okay but you will miss lots of bluffs obviously there are spots where naturally you might be over buffing but that's not in the big pots where you three bet with a too tight range first of all and then you're scared because villain is usually protected with some sets or so so it's just like people are value heavy especially in delayed lines as well right it's like something someone is checking back and then starts betting later. It's just like, how often are people checking back air with a plan to bluff later? The reason is just that absolute hand strength can only get better over time, really. It's like you don't have like a fourth pair that turns out to be five high on the river maybe let's not talk about like double pairing boards or some specialist stuff so you will get new value bets on all runouts but you won't get new bluffs in a way you either need to turn something into a bluff now or you have a bluff that you did not see that in the first place so this is just the milking sizing on the river yeah this is something we need to know there are just there are some people who are bluffing somewhat correctly maybe even over bluffing shout out to pedro and there are some people who are not bluffing at all one thing i like doing there is really to run the best case worst case scenario it's like best case is i'm making i don't know point one big blinds because villain is slightly over bluffing here the worst case is i'm losing my full bet because villain is never bluffing and then you probably get a hint where we are heading here so reaction game this is the first thing people are often value heavy so our thing is we really need to find out hey we have a pure bluff capture, no matter how strong it looks in absolute hand strength and then just fold. People size their hand is the second thing. Often we know, okay, that sizing doesn't make sense. Doesn't exist in PIO, but people are still taking it. It usually means something. So what could I say here as an example, let's take something like that. So we have a board that is like queen, nine, deuce, button versus big blind. Villain c-bets small. And the turn is a five. And you know that person is capable of doing everything. On that five turn, we are mainly just using an overbet. Now villain c-bets 75%. I know that this is just, it's just always that one hand strength that feels like overbetting is too much that can be a queen 10 and queen jack right so this is the first thing where for example i could start raising king queen just because of knowing that this is different than others but out of position especially like they want to see one more card maybe they block bet the turn which they never do usually or like they do something else right and reaction game as well does not only mean folding when they bet but it's really realizing as well how their other the other part of their range lacks if they only always have it when betting i mean how does their checking range look like it's like they are not bluffing enough all those gto bluffs go into a checking range so that needs to overfold insanely. So this is actually where we need to figure things out and attack that weak part. Søren asks, Stefan, what's your take on mass data analysis? It's a great thing once you ask great questions. It's not how you should learn poker because then it's like some people learn poker like programming a bot. It's like, yeah, you always need to bet 30% here because it's working. On ace on the turn, you can always check raise large because that is working. It's like, yes, it's great to figure out spots, right? If I have access to like mass data analysis now, I would probably find really, really great spots and it would boost my game, especially on like just looking at one limit right now. So this is something I use my own database or like small data analysis probably, but that would be probably very, very interesting. It's maybe you want to double check and watch my video on bluff catching. There I was talking about the pyramid of reads. It was really like different steps of reads and mass data analysis is just like a big, big, big hut, which represents how people are playing versus people. But we are more interested how people are playing versus us. So when I look like the craziest monkey in the pool, mass data analysis can tell me a gazillion times that everyone is overflowing. most of Most of the recs, at least, won't over-fold to me then, right? Because they see I'm over-raising 65% on the button and I'm stabbing any two against their checks, right? Even though it's correct that people do that in the pool, that they over-fold there. But if I go too crazy, it's like they see that as well. Thinking players is a thing. So it's like just taking that as a given is a little difficult. So I like to always think about, okay, what's natural? Why is that the mistake? What are people doing wrong? All right. Now I guess it's the time to finally come to the top five exploits I was talking about. And we start with a very, very, very easy one. Top exploit number five. I made a list. This is my fifth favorite one now is just to open raise loose. What are we doing? We open raise loose, especially from the button and the small blind. So my raise only chart in the small blind tells me 43% first in my button chart tells me something like 42% first in. I think my numbers are in the small blind more than 50 and on the button like something like 48 so the reason is right or what is the read that we need to do that two things villain is first under defending which means i have more direct ev in him folding i win the hand that's a big ev boost for my weakest hands and the other thing that people forget about is people are not three betting enough in certain spots that means instead of him three betting and i fold my hand i see a flop i see a flop and i have equity so it's a spot where i mean i should have like a certain portion of that pot is coming back to me compared to folding to a three bet. The favorite victims here are definitely the knits, definitely the mass tablers. When do we do it? Every time a player behind is too tight. But we need to make that decision, how far can we go? This can be 100% small blind first in, or that can be something like, let's be slightly looser than what our GTO chart says, more or less. Let's see whether I found an example here. Oh, the table gourd. So this was, I just was looking for the weakest hands. I was open raising from the button and this is what I found. I think this has to be from, from this week pretty much. And I sit on a table. We see like, okay, 32, 18 players. So probably it's a little recreational player, 24, 19, 7 19 7 three bet here that's one of the movie extras of the the old school mass tablers and 22 19 yes this guy now table core okay he's not existing so we are not playing button first in here we are heads up we are playing heads up and then heads up 10-5 off i guess is an open race right so we face 1.6 percent three bet from the small mind actually bianca neve is probably not defending like he should in heads up he's probably defending a big blind versus a button range and he's too tight 1917 yes he likes three betting but he's not defending enough How much people are defending you see in the gaps, the VPIP PFR gap. This is his calling. Here we have 14 gap. He likes calling. He has five gap. That should be somewhat standard. He has three gap. Okay. I mean, he's not participating, unfortunately, but he's paying the blinds. So in 1970, that's like, he's not defending not defending passively. What I should have done here is min raising, right? That would be another exploit to depending on the gap, BPI, PPFR, just, or like having another read on the likeliness people are defending. We can use our open race sizing, right? Bigger size makes only sense when I want to attack their, their weaker calling part. If he's just mainly defending by three betting anyways why why do i not take the minimum right or we can turn things around and really say like okay i want to put him in a spot that he doesn't like he doesn't like playing a pot without initiative so i force him to do that by giving him a great price it's like playing heads up with 35 bp epica Here we go. So this is a very, very important price. So now coming to the spot explanation of that. It's very easy for that one. We'll get a little tougher for the other ones. But yeah, what is it? Spot explanation. It's low variance direct EV. This boosts your win rate without any variance. I can just give up post-flop. I made my money here pre-flop. And sometimes I make a two pair plus. It's like, we can take that away from our range. We do not need to range bet anything when we are actually running around with like a 90% opening range. And we have seen what, who are the victims, the nits and the old mass tablers. So we use that exploit against people who really don't care and play their standard game right or sitting there with a coffee waiting for kings and aces they don't care even when they see a 10-5 off at showdown they probably don't have the time like while playing eight tables or clicking through until the next pocket kings to really think about that but it's like they are not really thinking players in the way we expect people to do that. It's like now the only thing that could happen is he figures out that this guy is super tight and then adjust to that. But he always has the risk that we did not figure out the type player, especially in soon games. You cannot rely on. Yeah. Who score will know that this will be on 80% race for interest because of that guy. You can be on the normal table where that guy sits here always, but I'm foretabling myself. I might just miss it, and then he makes a big mistake. So that's like some reassurance here. We are definitely insured. That's good. What I always want to think about is when I use my exploits to know what is the correct re-exploit. Here the re-exploit is villain defending correctly and he should three-bet looser now. And this is a step one re-exploit. In my eyes there are two different kinds of re-exploits. Step one and step two. So step one means i do something and villain can now react and re-exploit that right here i do something i open raise lose it's his turn he can exploit that by three betting lose it's a very very easy exploit you can see it you can guess it you can three bet lose it's an easy exploit but just because of the player types or the uncertainty of Zoom, it's very, very unlikely. But we need to keep that in mind. It's easy to re-exploit that. We'll get to step two things later. All right. Top exploit number four. Overfold versus 3-bets. What are we doing? We are folding versus 3-bets, and we are 4- four betting only for value. The read that we need is villainous to tight. The favorite victims, it's exactly the same spot like before. Mass tablers and knits. When do we mainly do it against big blind three bets? I mentioned it before. All right, let's actually, let me just pull up Pio's solution here solution here not a solution a solved range here let's have a look before i said people are not taking the pure three bets when was the last time you have seen someone big blind versus button three betting king 10 off that's just a little this year ace 10 off queen 10 0 0 0 0 and i'm talking about the 60k hands i just played yes i have seen ace jack off king queen off i'm actually not sure i have never seen fives never sixes never sevens never eights to be honest i have not seen this year not seen this year not seen this year not this not this. Right, so we are still at 11% here. What I did as well was actually doing the math. So I was taking my charts and running the numbers pretty much. So on my charts, big blind should 3-bet like 14 point something percent, the small blind should 3-bet like 15 point 15 point something percent that adds up to a probability where we from the button should get three bet 28 percent the overall times i got three bet after open raising the button in my pool though was 21 percent now one thing is that the people deviate not too much from the small blind, right? Because they are just way more pure three bats, right? You three bat king, queen off pretty much. If you aren't playing without flats, you're just three bat all the time. So there's less deviation. So what that means is it's very likely that people, instead of those 14% from the big blind, have something like 8%. So yeah, let's take a look again here. I think it's pretty clear what the spot is. And what do we have here? We have okay, standard player, standard player, standard player, standard player, standard player. A 7.1 three bet total. I mean here I have a pop-up that I cannot click on now but it's very very likely that this player was only three betting like 6% from the big blind. And then what I did once or let a friend do for me is actually on, I think I have it in the slides here. Next slide. Let's have a look. Let's look at that first. Actually, this year is a preflop simulation, not playing against the perfect big blind three betting range, but just playing at 7%. And this is what we see, how we should react. Again, be careful because from now on, Villain is playing perfectly. I'm not bluffing Ace-5 suited against that range because Villain won't know that we are just like Kings plus for value. So he won't, I mean, Villain will still get in his Queens, right? So it's like like, this is now villain is not following up perfectly against our way too tight range now, obviously. So this is the over-folding we should be doing. Like pocket nines, you can just freaking throw it in the mug. Pocket tens, you can just sometimes throw it in the mug if you want. Ace queen off is a really, really, really bad, bad hand. And this is what I had here, right? So ace queen off against even the bigger sizing. Easy, easy mug, right? This year, as you say, right in the chat, this is the button response to people not three betting tight enough. 6%, 7%. We have lots of those players in the pool. And this year, probably I know enough people of you that call loser from the cutoff against this player type. We're like, yes, pocket 10 is always called. Ace, queen, off, always. Continue. Right? So this is just something we are in the reaction game. We are not playing charts. If they 3-bet 7%, we need to react to that once we know. Or we can have that population. So, yes, 4-5 suited and 5-6 suited. They do quite well against kings and aces. Ace-queen-off does really shitty against kings, aces, queens, and ace-king. So yeah, king-queen-off is really a big punt. So bluffing is a big punt as well. Yeah, so this is one of the exploits. We're going to do more of a standard response. Yes, absolutely. Maybe think about it. Maybe this should be your standard and the normal range should be your exploit in a way, right? Like just for your mindset, turn things around, right? So other recs who fold like 70% versus three bets, I'm proud of them, right? Because it's really, it's tough to fold nines here. It's really tough. I mean, we can, now this year's again, thinking that villain villain plays perfectly which won't be the case right so someone who plays like that won't play perfectly but actually he has a range of jacks plus ace king where he won't make two big mistakes either just visualize an old man coffee type and think what you would do in a casino yes that's it okay so again coming to the spot explanation. We are in the reaction game. We cannot make EV here. Our EV comes from the times villain doesn't 3-bet. This is why we are looser in the first place and often get to play a pot with initiative, with range advantage, with nut advantage, with positional advantage. Interesting why small pockets are not flooded more if villain is super strong. That's just because of the sizing. I the sizing i mean right in real life the pockets will show a profit but here villain continues to play perfectly and will sometimes get away if the board is four five six he does not necessarily stack off his queens right because we did not we did not continue anything he wins against pretty much again we have villains who do not care who play six percent three bet does not care about someone over folding like he's not adjusting to you because you have like 70 percent fall to three bet if he would he would have other numbers he will never ever realize again we should ask ourselves the question how can this get re-exploited by loose three betting and this is now what we have think about it this is a step to re-exploited? By loose 3-betting. And this is now what we have. Think about it. This is a step to re-exploit now. We are folding. The hand is over. He cannot exploit it now, re-exploit our fold now. He needs to travel back in time to design a different 3-betting range. That's all. It's really, he cannot re-exploit. Once he designed his 3-bet range in the way he did, he can't do anything about it. He really needs to travel back in time and design a different three-betting range. Sure, he can do that the next time, but how can he figure out? So this is important for me. It's a very different thing, whether villain can still act or not. Here's an exploit that is not re-exploitable in the moment because villain did make the mistake already okay so if face under 10 bb for example you can flat more yes absolutely then it's just an investment and return calculation and just like decreasing your investment by one or two bb is a big factor here okay and villain can re-exploit that by post-flop adjustments to our strong range, which means he shouldn't stack off his freaking overpay all the time, which, I mean, you know what's going on, right? And he should, against our tight forebetting range, he should probably not stack off jacks or queens. Won't happen, right? So this here is something that would be a step one re-exploit. He can realize, okay, we are just actually super, super tight now. He can still react, but it's like very, very, very unlikely that this is ever happening. Okay. I'm a little behind time. I need to speed up for exploit number three. We have seen this year. I hope it's like as mind blowing as it was for me, for most of you. So if someone has perfect fault, three bad fault for it, while the whole pool is three betting, these should not reaction also be to just value 3 or 4 because he doesn't adjust? Yes. If someone was perfect, actually, it doesn't matter too much. Okay, let's get to the next. My exploit number three, actually, it's the number two favorite one, right? But the other one is one I need to use more often, so I made it number two. So topic slide number three, size up with value. What are we doing? We are using exploitative, large value bets. It sounds easy. This is what everyone does because it works. In Zoom 200 in January 2022, it will still in five years. So what is the read we need? Villain doesn't think too much about risk reward. I have a bluff catcher. Do I call or not? He has it or not. Those 50-50 black-white situations. Who are my favorite victims? Everyone. Fun players don't like folding, so they like calling. We have mass tablers. So if they get to the river, they showed us they have something. They are not letting go when they have something. That's that. Sometimes you need to fold a flush. What the fuck? No way, right? It's like he might have this and that, right? People who never bluff are still catching. Then what else? Well, the maniacs, the wizards. I mean, they are anyways making sure, right? Let's do the math, right? then not overfold very very important three times pot let's go crazy it's like bluffy even the knits well they have aces and kings so it's like i mean what what could they do they cannot fold so when do we do that not versus river bats when we are betting river that's a little typo here i guess so when batting river that should be and i just brought a few mistakes not mistakes mistakes by villain maybe but a little examples so i know let's go through that it's low it doesn't look nice but still i hope it's big enough that you can read let's take the first hand on the very left we have a wreck he is a freaking old school mass grinder he plays 2017 i can tell you that blind. I call 7-8 off. I flop a freaking two pair. I know that he is not check raising enough on boards like that, so I start with a big sizing right away. I've turned a freaking boat, which this is a board I'm not overbetting on, so I'm just like going with my 75%. Everything bricks, he might have a six. I mean, not everything bricks, but a straight gets there. I can have nine, 10, nine, jack, jack, 10. In theory, obviously I'm never bluffing that spot, but Willen might have a six and he's probably calling sizing inelastic. He reads my name, says high stakes pro, clicks on the call button. I want that he makes a bad call with the six. He ended up calling ace 10 with like even blocking the only potential bluff in theory i could have but this guy has played 2017 and i play every day against him i just ripped freaking three times pot and then you tournament guys come again to me like yeah i'm just like betting 75 because i mean if i bet bigger he will fold his pocket aces all day long. It was, it was a 40 second tank call. And then this is like my favorite moment right now. If people go in the tank, I've never had in the, I don't know, in the last, I don't know how many sessions I never had someone really going into the tank until last second and then not click call. It's just like, they try as that time that they just need time to convince themselves to finally make the call yeah my name helps a lot with that that's that's true but it hurts when i try to bluff it definitely does so the first one was against old school mass grinder second one is against recreational player flatting there in middle position playing 60 big lines i open race call so call. So here I like to go for a check raise to get stacks in or often just to see what they do first. He checks back, that's a little sad. Turn brings a freaking flush draw, some draws he might have, he might flat random four, five, five, six, whatever. I take over, I overbet 150%. Need to get the money in the middle. River is a super brick, everything busts. i don't care what he thinks he might have a bluff catcher he won't be the most fluffy guy usually it's like one of the notes are important here right but this was kind of the standard passive calling station fish i mean here it's just two times pot right i would have done the same with three times pot it's the same thing like give him the challenge he won't be able to to times pot, right? I would have done the same with three times pot. It's the same thing. Like give him the challenge. He won't be able to like fulfill, right? He has a queen. I give him the challenge to fold that queen. No way he does that, right? So again, he will never raise. Other people bet like 75, 75 and lose like $100 in value here. Now you could say like, maybe they gain other parts of value because villain is then ever bluff raising the river. Like no, not happening. All right, let's get to the third hand. Very fun one as well. We have someone open raising early position, already a bad player. Would you fold queen 10 in his shoes? Yes, I fold everything. I'm not flooding queen 10 in middle position in the first place, but I fold range against those type of plays it's really that i'm sitting there i have my chips and i can decide do i give it to the crazy fancy bluffer guy or do i give it to that idiot who just like plays his value hand and i always choose this one give it to the fancy bluffer guy right he earns it and i will see it in his stats if he does that over and over again. So if it's freaking Pedro, I might flip a coin. All right. So let's get to the third hand. Pocket force. I flat on the button. We are three-way on a monotone board. We just check down. No reason for me to start here with my pocket force. I think it can't be too bad to step on it. But yeah. Villain. Fancyly,'s four dollar forty fours in my turn set of fours and the open razor over call so i think people play pretty face up it's very likely that they bet large when they have something good and it's very likely that they raise as a as a recreational when they have a very good diamond so i like raising here for reasons. I get maximum payoff when I hit my nuts and I actually have good fold equity. So what I need is equity against calling range and actually folding out hands that are ahead. If someone here flats random pocket sevens with his diamonds, like I'll be seven, he might find the fold. So two things, right? River pierce the thing and we have a recreational who sits on a flush always i don't think it's too many high flushes but just like this the tiny chance that he sits on an ace of diamonds is enough to definitely make that the best line give them the challenge they cannot compete in it's like really he has the ace the ace of diamonds. It didn't take him three seconds, right? He has in his mind the nuts. I bet five times pot. Yeah. Oh, is he not re-raising? Yeah. Maybe he should. Maybe not, right? Maybe I'm bluffing and he wants to let me bluff. Yeah. It's actually not such a creative turn race. You see that in all the forecut flush boards that actually the hands that still have equity against calling range, when calling range just flushes, you need a set to have equity against that. Those still get bad pretty often with some frequency. Yeah, it's kind of a solver thing. I applied it here in a three-way pot as a concept, but it gave me room to do something fancy on the river. So just getting those little four times pot in there, getting snap calls, I guess is what we call clear net EV. So this is now exploit number three. Big for value. It's not a, it's, it's not rocket science. Okay. So I still need to speed up. Ah, okay. Spot explanation. What happens here? I know you love all of my paint examples here. They look very shitty today, so sorry for that, but I still like them. So what is Villain's situation that he is in? I'm talking about situations where I know Villain has a bluff catcher. All three of those situations were the same. Villain did make calls before where there were no real draws. So Villain were always on a bluff catcher and i could pretty much discount all snap folds here on the very left let's say this is full range of villain villains range is all snap folds is no snap folds just bluff catchers and not really protected with nuts right maybe having like one or two boats themselves i don't care about that and then i give them a challenge with that very very big bet i give them the challenge to fold the majority of their range which well just like is counterintuitive they're freaking bluff catchers want to call everyone has the desire to call it's cool we celebrate hero calls when was the last time you celebrated a hero fold with your body no you were always crying about that you needed to freaking fold that hand even though it was so good we are crying about faults we are celebrating calls and then especially put yourself in my shoes or in the shoes of my villains facing a bet from me like three times pot you have the decision between feeling like a hero or feeling like an idiot, but you should choose with the correct answer, feeling like an idiot 75% of the time, and only feeling like a hero, like 25% of the time, it's way more likely that you end up 50, 50. So this is really that, that where people, everyone says people are over-folding, but this is the clearest one spot where everyone is calling too often they don't have snap folds they need to fold 75 percent of their bluff catchers how could this get re-exploited people over folding left catchers right which brings us to the next topic slide attack smaller sizing with raises another thing right so here over folding something you can do now and actually the other part would be more of a step to re-exploit when i'm not over betting they can discount nuts from that range and should check raise thinner which is incredibly tough to be doing and just no way this is ever happening right it's like sit there the next time oh but goose is just betting half pot three quarters now but he would jam his top boats all the time so i can go thinner for value and add bluffs maybe yeah forget about it okay so let's go to topic slot number two and there i have i don't even have examples because it's such an easy one fall bluff catchers every one of you i think is sitting on the river in that exact same spot we're all looking for reasons to call because calling is cool calling is fun calling cannot can win us the pot trolling cannot win the pot and this is a very very big psychological problem because most of the time people are value heavy in most spots so we want to call we want to find reasons for calling we will always find reasons for that what we want to achieve i go these days in my zoom 200 sessions with trying to find reasons to fold and i'm still pissed at myself because the last session i had one and didn't follow up with it i was calling king queen suited versus a three bet out of position the flop was five three deuce it went check check so king queen suited on a brick board goes check check turn is the freaking king i check to the three better he bets 75 i call river is another brick he bets another 75 this is exactly that spot i would have bet like 150 in his shoes but he's like ace king and nothing else like he's not turning his ace queen into a bluff he's not checking back queen jack with the goal of bluffing was like i don't know a weak rag recreational i wasn't sure i was just sitting there and click on my freaking top pair call look into ace king where i found plenty reasons of folding if you look for reasons to call you will find those you can look up pio sure it's a call but that's bullshit right so really i found reasons to fold and didn't follow up with it so what is the read we need to have villainous value heavy let's change that let's just say people are value heavy we need to read on them not being value heavy to make the call that's that's how you should turn it around who are the favorite victims knits old school mass tablers i'm not folding against ped I? What the fuck? No. Freaking Pedro, Brazilian. That's enough. So I make the calls there, but against Nits and old school mass tablers, just fold freaking everything. When do we do it? Now is correct versus Riverbats. All right, spot explanation. We are in the reaction game. Our EV comes from the times the villain does not bet and barrel. If people aren't bluffing, their frequencies are lower. Then they check to us. Then we take the pot away. Then we win there. We can call the turn because we know they give up their bluff on the river. This is where our extra EV is. Again, villains do not care. That's our big plus. people who like again we're talking about the nits and we're talking about the old school mass tablers both of those groups do not care how could it be get re-exploited by over bluffing how likely is that let's say someone is three big blind versus middle position board is king high king eight deuce turn five river three you sit there with king jack suited good top pair king what did i say king five deuce king nine deuce five three something like that you sit there with king jack suited and you are on the river facing the third barrel yeah villain is repping ace king plus give the money to the crazy guy who managed to three bet a bluff pre flop who managed to keep going on the flop, to keep going on the turn, to go all the way on the river. Maybe there is one person in this world who can achieve that on 200. Pedro. Okay? But maybe there's another one. But then your call is winning 2BB. But if there are, and there are lots of people who are never bluffing, then your call is losing your full bet, which should be like around 50 big blinds, 60 big blinds, maybe even. So best case, worst case scenario. There are cases where people are not bluffing at all. And we're looking for like, they might be slightly over bluffing. Whether it's just, we are fooling ourselves here. And how could that get re-exploited? By trapping as well is the other thing. Because actually when they when they check i'm going for thin value it's like yeah actually people in this exact spot make more money against me by checking their ace king i fold a hand that against their check i will value bet instead okay now coming to exploit number one the one you have all been waiting for and the most difficult one actually but my favorite one charge them it is raising thin value against face up hands what is the read we need to have we need to know the players who choose their sizing according to their hand this can be river block bets this can be term sizing this can be anything and you find those victims in all player groups especially players, but also mass tablers and the pedros of this world, the maniacs, because, you know, they are overconfident. They do whatever is best for them, not thinking about that this can get re-exploited. We do that against turn and especially river bets. So I found two fancy examples, both about turn raises. Let's have a look at them. First, the left side. We're playing against an aggressive, more like Pietro type of guy, but a little really crazy. I wouldn't call him wizard. So I open raise the cutoff. The VIT 90 calls the big line. I see that small on king 6-3. VIT decides to check raise. This is a half pot check raise, super standard. The turn is an eight. For everyone who wants to know how to build ranges here, make sure to check out my check race and then continue on how to build check race ranges community coaching. And we see a three quarters pot bet here. So villain has king six, king three, pocket threes, pocket six is for value. He has four, five, five, seven, flush draws, deuce four, deuce five as like the standard bluffs. The good hands should go directional in most of the time or are, right? So what do you think? I mean, we see the showdown here, but this is here that thin value where actually I overfold the turn. I have a hand here. If he overbets the turn, I'm folding my king queen most of the time against the player pool. But if he uses that size and he either has a draw, buying a next card, not being ready to go all in just now, or he has that thin value that some people find in their check raises as well. King jack here. And then if this is their range, my only action is the value raise with pretty much king queen plus. So actually we find a spot here where I would fold against over bets, but I'm value raising against smaller bets. Very, very, very big exploit. And here we see, okay, that actually made me quite some good money because I wouldn't get anything extra on the ace of diamonds on the river. Maybe what does he do with his four or five of diamonds, right? If he jams over the top, I'm snap calling him off. So it's like a very special spot. Right side is against a recreational player. Even more of a fancy spot. So jack, 10, six. I see that my king, 10. He check raises small again, I call. And turn. I mean, he's wrapping sixes, tens, jacks, jack, 10, and like all kinds of draws and on that turn he decides to go half pot i put him on king queen and king queen and king nine of hearts only pretty much and i just raise my hand which is already a very close call on that board like yes those hands i was talking about i know they are calling but won't invest any more money in most rivers. So again, here I got sucked out on, which is not a big problem, right? I raced easily in position and bought me an easy river decision while I had, okay, only, where is it, turn 68.2% equity, but still something to look out for, right? And now I could add a gazillion river spots where people just block bet and have like second pair no kicker all the time where we click call way too often and should rather raise. This is my number one topic slide going for thin value when you know their hand and your hand is better. All right, let's try to get to the end a little more quicker. I'll keep the note-taking part in mind. Maybe the ones who did ask the questions, open up a nice little thread in Discord. Let's discuss it there because for the people watching the video later, really going over the 90 minutes is a little painful. So let's outsource that to another place or another time. And now I think I have one little last question for you. Let's get to the Kahoot. Because what I did was now at the same time, my recommendation for what you can do, because when it's about exploiting, it's always about knowing where your EV comes from, exploiting consciously. It's easy to say we are better than them, but really saying where you are making the money is a different thing. And now what I did was just before this coaching, I played one session of 10 minutes. I had an open office file open on the side and I wrote down every conscious exploit I made for 10 minutes. I mean, writing takes some time as well. I couldn't speed up too much. And this is the question I got for you. In a standard 10-minute session of four tabling Zoom 200, how many exploits did I make consciously? 10 minutes. I didn't look at the number of hands. I played like a 25-21 style, if that helps. okay i I made it easy, right? So obviously the maximum thing. And I wrote them down for you. So don't worry. I mean, now we don't need to, there's no podium. That doesn't count. I don't show in the fastest one. All right, so yeah, spot explanation. I missed that. I think we talked enough about that. We are in the reaction game. People are playing their hand. We need to realize it and then act accordingly. This is very tough to get re-exploited because we are talking about step two. Once they use a certain sizing, they killed it already. All right. So this year was my session of 10 minutes. Maybe there are typos in there, but read quickly through it, right marked them into categories with the colors. Red was always pre-flop exploits where I loosened up. We start off with a button queen 8 off, which is not 100% frequency because small blind was a knit. I opened jack 9 off from the cutoff because small blind and big blind were knits. I keep going with the red. I did 4-bet bluff heavy against a mass tabler wholer who is three betting actually too light but overfalls to the four bets. I did open raise three do suited in the small blind. I open raise 10-8 suited from under the gun because there was a massive knit and five tight mass tablers. I open raise 10-8 off versus the rec just because he's under three betting from the small blind. I did race queen seven suited from the hijack because both cut off and button were knits and under queen 10 off from under the gun because i found button knit and a weak player that i over realized equity against the big blind and so then another thing i had middle position was big blind here i sized up against someone who was just like passively putting his money in the middle when I had something good on ace, queen, jack. And then the same thing, small blind versus button, the three bet pot we talked about in the very beginning, I clicked on the 75% button on ace, seven, five suited with my ace king. The turn was actually a six bringing the double flush draw. And that guy's just calling and never putting money in himself pretty much. So I just jammed 150% pot or whatever was left. Got snap called by his ace eight, which is like a top pair plus open ender. No flush draw. Yeah, he sucked out on me. But still like that shows I just won a stack where probably on average, I wouldn't like 25 picks or something like that. So this massive all exploits that we talked about here pretty much. The pink one, one, okay. I fold it because someone is too tight. That always hurts a little. I made it one exploit to fold against the delayed bet. Here the manual upsize, here we go. So, okay. Now wrapping things up, double check on the video. If you want to go through that, really, this is my recommendation for making an exercise. Play 10 minutes, write it down. It's really easy. Once you think about it, you're searching way more for those type of exploits. You're way more cautious about everything you're doing. And you have that awesome feeling on knowing why you should be winning money now. All right, let's summarize that. The key takeaways. Try to figure out which player grade groups you play against and label the players. I talked about stats here, but try to not go too much into detail. So stats are not necessary. Then the second thing, have exploits prepared you want to execute versus certain groups. Think about your mindset. I go in every session, I need to fold, I need to fold, I need to fold, don't go with crazy bluffs, over bet for value, over bet for value, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold. It kills me inside. I would like to play better poker, but this is how I figured out I will make the most money or for now the most EV. Yeah, the money will come later maybe. Then the next thing, know the re-exploits against your game. To just be prepared. It's not that they are not like re-exploiting at all, but just like having a feeling. Okay, how easy is that what I do here to re-exploit? Oh, is it never happening? Okay, then it's cool, right? And now very, very important. Lots of us, or I was like that, a little nit at heart that it's like exploits do not need to work 100%. You don't need a success rate of 100% when you're bluffing. Like, oh, I overbet you folded, so that was a bad exploit. No, feel free to go crazy. And that especially is talking about crazy exploits, not crazy play style. It includes crazy folding. Remember that king-queen on king-high against two barrels in a three-bet pot against the right player? When you know he has ace-king, you know. And even if it's wrong one out of four times, you made a great fold. This can include that. Just try it out and learn. Unfortunately, with the bluffing, we will see the showdowns when they catch us. With the folding, we won't see the showdowns. But yeah, still next time, you can even think about that in spots where you have it, right? Just say like, I would fold every bluff catcher here. Then you call with your nuts and you get that reassurance. You just know, hey, I would have folded and you probably would have folded correctly. Do that exercise that I just presented. And then very important, cheer and discuss that. Read population tendencies. We have players of all kinds of stakes. I will maybe talk a little more about the 100, 200 players where I can really have an opinion on. And then probably in L10, we will help you as well. So just make sure to work on that part of the game as well not only run the the sims or whatever talk about the the fancy theory and really go crazy and uh yeah that's what i'm going to do now hopefully doing a little better in the zoom pool now crush those suckers that's the plan all right have a good one i will open up a feedback thread would be happy to get some some comments in there in in discord just tell me what i can do better what was very good this time how much it hurts that it takes 100 100 minutes but i think that it was still pretty cool and for everyone about the note-taking super interesting topic happy to go a little deeper into that in discord or keep it for one of the next community coachings one after another that's it see you next time and bye bye once i find the close button
