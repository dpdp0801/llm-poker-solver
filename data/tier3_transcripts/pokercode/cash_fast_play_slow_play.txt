### TOPIC: cash fast play slow play
 So yeah, we are discussing slow playing and fast playing today. And yeah, I try to find the mix. Hey, Jerome, try to find the mix again to talk for like to talk kind of beginner friendly, as well as to give some insights to the more advanced players. So yeah, as always, I'll try to ask questions as well to have you a little guess and think as well. And yeah, we just head into it, right? I'm sorry. always i'll try to ask questions as well to have you a little guess and think as well and yeah we just head into it right so which jason l there was a jason l i played a lot with like moving up up soon 500 and stars 1k battles just about in like maybe like maybe 2014. Maybe 15. And yeah. He was a very strong player. And then I kind of lost sight of him. Okay. Went to slow play. Went to fast play. And yeah. As always. I'll just let you. Know the plan that we have here. Quickly talking about the spot. We're talking about talking about today obviously slow playing fast playing we can do that in all kinds of notes of the game tree in all kinds of spots that come up maybe you did no but it's that's really it's a fix fixed in my mind for sure that same screen name was there maybe you get there one day so yeah i'll i'll just use for the example one or two kind of spots i want to talk about then we'll talk quickly about the incentives for slow and fast playing i try to to break it down to two things to talk just about our hand so that we talk a little about hand versus range we have a certain hand we have a certain goal we want to achieve this is maybe i mean this this works on the high stakes as well but the the bigger the bigger part of the understanding is is in the incentives for our range when does it make sense to slow play why should we sometimes do that and how do we benefit or against which player types are we benefiting from that against when we do that? So two things, thinking about the hand itself and thinking about how it fits into our range also. Talking about incentives for slow and fast playing. Then I got a shitload of examples in my head prepared. I put the list on a slide to not miss miss any and we'll pull out a little gto wizard i have no clue how long stuff takes so we got plenty of stuff to just browse through there for me to explain things then we quickly talk about equities because obviously slow playing fast playing triggers that we have a rather strong hand and i want to talk quickly about the difference of how strong a hand can be. Right. So there is a big, big, big difference. I'll take that right away. Whether we have something like 80% equity or we have like 99% equity or even 100. So that makes a place a big, big, big role when we talk about slow playing. Then I'll just give you it's kind of the same thing in a way right I just made two slides golden rules and key takeaways. This is something I've tried to use to hammer into my head if there is too much going on. I like to keep it simple. So I wrote down some golden rules for you to to remember to make sure you follow those and to not end up with a fancy play syndrome right. So if there is stuff I can show you here why it makes sense to slow play here or do something crazy here that's usually some some exceptions we'll talk about that so that we don't want to be too fancy I have some gold rules and mainly they are stating what you shouldn't be doing and yeah then I'll let you go with the key takeaways and mainly I can can take that, start with that as well. And mainly fast play the shit out of your villains. Okay, quickly the spot or again, maybe, I don't know, some more viewers came in. As always, if you haven't been with lots of coachings I gave here, it's always a very, very, very open chat. And this is what I love about it. Any questions, welcome. There's no no stupid question even if you're a super beginner or if you're a super pro and you think like you you're annoying people i try to find the right words to answer your questions this is what is the biggest part of the coaching to not just i could make just videos if i just want to talk to to the screen here so yeah everyone is welcome and now let's get started. This spot, very easy. We have a clear value hand and are on the flop or turn. So actually I had something else written down there before, added that I said like we want to go directional in, that we mainly just talk about super nuts, but I took that away to cover one more spot where some checking is happening whether we i'm not sure i wanted to put it in here as well to just show you where that makes sense and this is kind of another hand class that is not interested in going all all all the way but is interested in build like further building a little like getting a little more money in the pot and slow playing in the sense of checking now and building that pot a little later so this is the spot covering those two things the main examples will obviously be some kind of super nutted stuff that we think about trapping or not and yeah that's just how i wanted to define the spot we're talking about today. Let's start with the incentives then. Incentives to fast play. Maybe you didn't read so far. Actually, I want to ask that as a question. Just give me very, very simple answers. And if you are very quick reader and read it already, it's fine to copy paste. So yeah, just give me your answers. When is there a good reason to fast play? When should we fast play? Mantas typing like to see a Chevy typing, we block continuing range. Fast play means we have a value hand. Your answer is more like we block continuing range is something we consider when we want like this increases our fold equity and means we get more folds which is not good when we have a hand that wants to get money in the middle so blocking continue range is actually i want to say there no no nothing wrong in the chat but actually that's just like the wrong answer unfortunately but this when we're not blocking top pairs so kind of the other way around mantas let's say not just talking about top pairs let's talk about we are not blocking continuing range. So kind of the other way around, Mantas. Let's say not just talking about top pairs. Let's talk about we are not blocking continuing range. And to be more precise, we can say we want to unblock hands villain continues with that have very marginal equity against us. So maybe lots of people for you think about now having a set, then it's beautiful to get get called by a top here because the top here almost has no equity against us, right? It can make a running boat maybe against our bottom or mid set. And that's it. This is what I mean with it. We rather get the money in against the top here than against the flush draw. So really already focusing on that, how much equity does villain's hand have against our hand? So fast play villain cannot fold right a little exploited but yes when this guy is just not folding why should we ever trap right our plan is to get the money in the middle we know he doesn't fold so we bomb it right and actually that brings us to to my personal definition and here welcome suzu by the way i read your your your your bigger message you sent me i will answer maybe later maybe tomorrow but i'm very very busy right now with a sick wife and yeah he is new here and wrote a couple of things and i'm super thrilled for for having him here so i want to give him a little shout out and yeah i read that stuff but sometimes i need a little time so fast play when will and can't fall's it. And there's maybe the perfect point for the definition of fast playing. What does fast playing mean? It's not only betting, it's not only raising, but it can mean getting a certain maximum amount of money in the middle. Fast playing for me also means I'm choosing a bigger bet size or as an option, right? Not only that I need to bet, but maybe we have a spot where we usually bet small, but this guy's always calling and he calls his top pairs and we have a bottom set. This is why we just freaking size up. We know he calls anyways, and this is also fast play for me. So different kind of it. All right. When the hand is vulnerable, Eric, very interesting because this can be be right. And this can be wrong, depending on the actual spot out of position when a hand is vulnerable. We very often actually slow play that to wait for a safe turn to not blow up a pot that then we have big positional disadvantage later, right? So we will have an example for that pretty sure. In position, we definitely want to bet because then we usually have the the chance if things get ugly we can just check back and we are happy that we already got money in the middle fast play when equity shifting cards can arrive and kill the action kind of the same thing out of position we don't want to do that too much if it's very, very vulnerable what we are having, because then we build a pot to be in a little bigger trouble later. In position, we definitely always go for the fast play. Okay, there was one more. When the hand is vulnerable, we will fast play. Oh, the other point I want to talk about is can we bomb out equity, right? So if our hand is vulnerable when we check, but if we bet and we fold out everything that, well, could kill our hand, well, that is even better, right? Let's say we are on the turn. We think about barreling and we think about an overbet and actually all the flush draws have to fold versus an overbet. Well, then it's beautiful because we kind of clean our spot and lots of river cards have been bad for us before and now we don't care too much. Fast play when we have absolute nut advantage. Yes, this is kind of now talking about a range. We have a clear hand, which mainly just means we keep the nut advantage over time, which means villain has not much incentivization to put a lot of money in the middle later, right? Obviously, when we slow play a good hand, we want him to overinvest, to invest more even later because we showed weakness. If it's really a huge nut advantage for us, that means we are in charge of blowing up the pot and we shouldn't wait for his help. Okay lots of lots of good things i just wrote down the first three things that came up to mind so this is what i wrote down very easy for spots when should we fast play and where villain pays now but not necessarily later right so this is my beautiful favorite example as always we have pocket tens on nine five deuce right now everyone is paying every gut shot every appear everything whatever once there is a 10 jack queen king on the board that gets way worse this is why this can be even a board where we use large bet sizes something like that right where the board can change in a way that we would get a lot of money now, but not necessarily later with the hand we are having. Second thing is that we see also the upside of villain folding something, right? I gave that as an answer for the guys who wrote down that our hand is vulnerable, that we fold out hands that have equity against us. We had the example with us having a set and villain calling top here. That's beautiful because he's almost drawing dead. But on the other hand, it's also good. Now, it's a little more realistic to talk about the turn here that we just fold out a freaking gut shot. A gut shot is only, yeah, sure, it can bluff on the river. there it likely stacks us and so that's very very dangerous and that's like eight percent looking from the turn to the river four outs usually if there are no blockers involved so this is very very important and also an upside of the betting part and obviously we are more we hope that he makes a bad call that's even better for us but it's clearly better than than trapping check check he gets there and we lose right so that's very bad the other thing is that villain is just not putting money in the middle right so jason l nailed that a little no where's the not this one suzu with a fast play when we have absolute not advantage so it's like he was more theoretical than i was my answer is a little more exploitative but meaning the same thing is the loon is just not investing money susu's answer says it's because of the board he's not interested in investing a lot of money i say because it's it's the player type in a way here right but he doesn't bluff wildly but the bluffs are not the main point we'll get to that later nor is he over investing with margin value hands right so that he's not value betting thinly and then we can raise and he has a tough spot and so on so we don't have that extra gain right so by checking back so now talk about in position with a strong hand we're killing one street of value we need to need to make up for that. If Willem bets the river, we can raise again and we kind of get our street back. We get the street back that we gave up on the turn. And so our goal is that he invests more in that line compared to us just bet, bet, betting. I always give it some time. So fast play against nits. That's actually true, right? Fast play against knits, they are not really paying off. This is why we also bluff, but they are not putting money into us. If you have a crazy guy who thinks you are capped and goes for like crazy river check jams because you checked once, well, this is the beautiful, beautiful, beautiful spot to slow play something. to just like, yeah let him misinterpret your hand strength let him hammer on it let it be a thin value or bluff we don't care it's about blowing up a pot it's about getting money in that's perfect if someone like suzu is never doing that well we don't care we rather build the pot ourselves and we are happy if they fall to gut shot. So yeah very good to start with and now it's a little goes hand in hand it's like the vice versa answers but still give me the answers for the incentives to slow play. Or even better to put it on a more personal level and I cannot say that anyone is saying something wrong, tell me when are you slow playing. Also examples are fine. I want to know your standard slow plays. Flop, turn, well, river checkbacks are not that cool as a slow play, but just versus a complete maniac. So Jerome says this guy with his Brazilian flagian flag is obviously putting in his deck in the middle once you check once that's it very very easy answer if someone else loves building the pot let them do what they love when you have it when we block continuing range right this is a very very good incentive if we bet we know whatever they could call with that they don't have it like we have freaking quad aces what should they have let them catch up let's give them a little piece right top set on a very dry board like a7 do so i think we bet high frequency on those boards still and include aces and then could check on the turn but yeah maybe some flop checks are also fine and aces is a part there right absolutely it's same thing we block everything slow play only when there's absolute evidence villain is crazy so this is one of the kind of golden rules for the lower stakes right people are slow playing way way way too much it's usually better to get the money in the middle yourself on lower stakes because people are not understanding relative hand strength. People are not using right bet sizes. They are not putting their stacks in the middle when they could and when they should, and this costs us money slow playing. The only slow play versus aggressive players never against passive players. Maybe here one thing that I've learned from in uni actually was a little hint for there was an exam. It was I think like some some business thing where just there were some statements and we should like mark whether they are true or false. And this guy gave us a very, very, very good hint before the exam is just like, always is always wrong, and never is always wrong. So always never are always wrong. So obviously, what Jason says here, only slow play versus aggressive player never against passive players. This never is questionable, because this is just how never and always works. There's are always exceptions. But in general, that is very, very true. I can tell you that if we block everything and have the chance that villain improves to something that he then is ready to invest a lot with. Let's say we have the freaking top boat and villain sits on gut shots and flush draws only. Well, we want to check back even against a passive player to let him make a second best hand and then charge his river flush, his river straight and so on. So there are chances, there's always an exception, and this is something good to remember for life that always and never is always wrong. Out of position when we block check back hands, right? So blocker issues, we can influence the little frequencies here and there. We know we have this hand hand this is why he bets more often than usual this is why he checks more often and so on right so very very clear but this is like slight influences maybe a little more in like three bet pots with tight ranges where blockers matter with wide ranges we should forget about that stuff the the effects are never that big that they really matter exactly here drone comes up with the lookalike principle very very good right gives you a guideline for how to play i call it the cornerstones of your range especially here three bad pots where ranges are tight you want to know exactly what you're you're doing with which hand type that you are protected as a stupid bird we don't need to be protected but that you know what you're doing in which line and why okay river spots position we check our air plus nuts in a lot of spots yeah absolutely and then we can still decide the bluff catchers that we get there in a natural way what do we do with those perfect all right let's see what i wrote down. I forgot already. No additional card kills our value. So villain, just meaning villain does not have 10% equity, not 8% equity, not 15. So the chance that we go from big winner to big loser needs to be eliminated. So we want to be as invulnerable, invincible as possible because this would really really suck if we let villain catch up and yeah then actually lose a stack instead of winning a big one so obviously the same thing means the same thing villain is drawing to to a second best hand can be good instead of folding he draws to something that let's say flush right on a Pierre Port board, he will invest like 35 to 50 big blinds, something like that for sure. So this can be a big win. Now repeating that even against passive players that can work, right? Let them get the flush. They are betting their flush, or maybe they are calling at least like one bet size that we can choose, like even an overbet or whatever right the other thing is that came up a couple of times from the chat we block villains calling range big time right we can talk about the quads the top boats and so on this will be part of the examples for sure now one more thing that we didn't mention so far i needed to put it in here because there are lots of tournament players as well where things change a lot right so we are here in all examples discussing 100 big blinds plus where we usually in a single race pot need more than three streets like one race usually or we go like bad big bad crazy over bad which is obviously part of the game also but if we can easily get to our desired pot size by skipping one street, yeah, I need to, need to rephrase that again for like some value hands don't want to go all the way that we just maybe want to get 20 big blinds in the middle and check like the turn or this works for shorter stacks or for tournaments if well, we check back like short, we check back lots of lots of sets for example if we can still get the money in the middle using two streets or uh shout out to to alex a student of mine who i work a lot with where we had we looked at the spots where villains should check back every straight for example in a in a blind versus blind spot because it was uh 20 big blinds 25 big blinds it's just i don't i don't remember the exact board maybe 763 something like that and he should check back every four or five in position just because let villain hit his freaking jack 10 offsuit king 10 offsuit something and that would stack off all the time so we get to our desired pot size is a nice phrase here to have because it covers kind of everything. Okay, so these were all those bullet points are incentives for just our hand. We're not even talking about range or anything. We just say we look down at our freaking two cards. We have a certain board. We think about what Willem could have. The typical, we play one hand against lots of hands that Willem could have, a range, and think about how do we maximize our value. We sometimes talk about villain's tendencies. Is he crazy? Is he not crazy? Is he nit? This is on the exploitative side, obviously. And yeah, that gives us incentives to we can now literally evaluate just like making a yes or no for the bullet points and evaluate a little. Does that sense to slow play or not now i want to quickly present yeah for all the paint fans a little range thought for the paint games and prepare you or show you one scenario where we should never slow play i need to say it now while obviously never is is always wrong and there are exceptions always, but we are pretty much never slow playing and a spot where it makes sense to slow play. All right, so let's pull out paint and we'll talk. So no more getting coffee. Oh, let's kill that now. I want to talk about the turn. So let's say we have a spot, we're in position, we c-bet the flop with a wide range and now we get a turn card and we have a decision. Or actually that works on the flop also. Who cares, right? So let's say we still have a rather wide range. That's the starting point. I will make that black. Rather wide range. This is weekends for all the ones who haven't seen my coachings and not enough videos yet, just go through the platform and watch a couple. And I'm sure in the first three, like longer ones, you will see some pain and you will get the explanation for what I show here. Left side is weak, right side is strong. This is just how I visualize range. So we have all kinds of stuff. And now let's talk about about abet or like a bigger flop bet. Which structure usually have do do which structure do do betting ranges have? How do they look like? One word is correct here, just who gives me the answer first. How do betting ranges usually look like polarized, right polarized raises or ranges, we either bluff or we bet for value. Sure, there's equity involved. But in general, especially when we talk about the turn, we can clearly say, are we bluffing or not? So what does that mean is we lose something, right? Let's talk about the checking range now, right? So if we bet here, not all of that, let's say we bet this, this air bet this here, and this is what we leave, and then we bet all the good hands because we are freaking not slow playing, then this is the freaking range we are getting. So the turn width when we check this here now is by eliminating our betting range, what we have left is our checking range. And now what happens to the next street is pretty clear. We get a new card. A new card in absolute hand strength can only improve our hands, right? It's impossible to go from a pair of Kings to something worse than a pair of Kings. Yes, we can counterfeit low pocket pairs. So always is always wrong. You remember that now. But in general, we always improve. So there's new good hands coming in. And this is something that we can think about already on streets before, right? So now what happens, not like that, we actually just copy paste that. Just fill the gaps here quickly. This is like beautifully on the line. Couldn't do that any better. And now we get new things, right? So we obviously don't add new combos of our range, but we can move them, right? This freaking gutshot just turned straight, for example. Not straight. This freaking top pair just made a nice, very nice-ish two pair. Something like that. And now all of a sudden because of the turn card, we have beautiful range again. We check back, we are protected. What should villain do? Running into our nuts? Running with a certain size in our medium strong? Whatever he does, we can find our bullshit that we can fold. Folding is part of the game. We need to fold. So this is what happens. And now the question is, where are the boards that we should or range-wise need to slow play on? I shouldn't phrase that more as a question, but it is a question. Which kind of boards are we forced to slow play range-wise? Where does it make sense to slow play after that explanation? When we are capped? Yeah, I don't like using that word too much because it's really tough for people to understand or I can read it into a right answer or in the wrong answer actually, depending on what you exactly mean. So try to be a little more precise here. Three flush turns is one part. Absolutely, that can make sense. But it's like, that is the answer, like the three flushes know that this part is not happening, because ending up with just that range and a lot of big stacks to play for is a big problem, right? Because villain didn't kill his nut part and then he can hammer on that. So if we can come up with spots where we already know that our checking range won't improve on any rivers, it's like never improving and always improving is, as you know now, always wrong. But it's very unlikely that we improve to a nutted hand. And this makes a lot of sense. For example, three flush is very good. If we just say on the turn we are betting every single flush we are having. That means for our checking range, it doesn't have a single flush, and then on freaking 80% of the cards on the river, villain can just like, in theory, 10 times pot jam any flush he has and all the bluffs, and he's killing us. because we are sitting there ah unlucky a brick now not the fourth spade and not the board pier like fuck what should we do is he bluffing is he not and we in face like a 10 times pot bet so theoretical standpoint when the nuts when we won't make new nuts so maybe one thing here chevy said is just is talking about the. I'm just talking about our range. Sometimes there's a range where villain can still improve. But I'm not let's say little asymmetric ranges like under the gun versus big blind. I villain can improve on lots of low cards, and we won't improve on them. So I were only with certain hands, the nuts we had on the turn, there's something like that. So maybe another interesting question is here, what are we protect? What does it mean we protect the weaker stuff? That's a very good question because this will, it's on a deeper level, a more advanced level. What is the problem if we play like that and we just bet every flush? I already gave you the example, but what does that protection actually mean? Exactly, we are protected against thin value bets. So lots of people think about, oh, we need to trap because he's bluffing so much, which is absolutely wrong. This can be a reason that a check is highest EV even for your strong hands, but this will be one of the golden rules or the key takeaways or whatever I mixed together there because for bluff catching, we don't need nuts. That's a very, very, very big learning. We can just check whatever back and just click on the freaking call button if people are over bluffing. But it protects us from thin value bets using actually two big sizes. Let's say the flush example. We bet every flush on the turn, but this time we check back. River is a brick. Willem can take his weakest flush and just jam 10 times pot which is way too much money for a freaking low flush there and we sit there and our best hand is maybe top set i mean obviously we need to call it but it just shows we did something wrong with our range right it's like if he does that and we protect our range with some flushes we just laugh at him and say like 10 times pot sure we just fold everything and call when we have it because our range made sense so whenever nuts won't change and we know it on the turn then or when it's unlikely that they change we want to kind of split them up well we might have an advantage now or a disadvantage. When we have an advantage, it doesn't mean that we need to take the full advantage now. We can take it later, especially like blocker spots like flushes, whether we just five times pot jam now or later, who cares, right? So this just when things are not changing. On the other hand, well, when things are changing a lot, and we already that on any freaking turn card we get like this addition, those new nuts, this year, this year, this year, this year. Well, then it doesn't make any sense to take the strongest hand from the flop and ever check it. Like, we don't need that. We know it's like, let's say, make a freaking sample, right? Let's say like, what is a good example? We have the queen. This is not here. We have the queen, 10, 7, right? And we check all kinds of things, right? On ace, we have new nuts. On a king, we have new nuts. On the jack, we have new nuts. On a 10, let's talk about the trips being nuts more or less. We have new nuts. On a 9, we have obviously new nuts. On an 8, on a 6, on a 7, yeah, obviously as well. 5, 4, 3 deuce are the only ones that are kind of whatever now, but then we can still predict that on lots of rivers we will gain new nuts. Is my internet slow? Anything going on there? Susu is talking about the five frames per second. I hope. My internet sucks these days all the time, but I hope it is okay. Hmm. Hmm. Okay, you can follow up. I keep going. I don't know what to change now. That's okay. Okay, so I hope that is clear. And then we just see this was kind of the range thoughts that we can know is this a spot where we should slow play from a theoretical standpoint and take our advantage later or be protected for later from thin value bets or should we just hammer all the time when we have it because we know our check back range will be fine on 70 plus of the cards okay cool now what's next? Examples. Beautiful. I'll just open up GTO Wizard and we start with a couple of examples. I'll drop some questions and we'll see. I'll ask you some slow plays. So first one, 986 with a flush draw will bring us to one little rule that will be in the gold rules. And where is it? And it's not this time we play out of position. That's a special one. We raised the cutoff and button calls kind of a special here. Everyone else folds and we get the board 986 with a flush draw. So what do you consider nuts on that board? First question. There will be lots of questions now. So what do you and I'll just browse a little through to give thoughts with examples. What do you consider nuts on that board? Sets and top two. Okay. So which is the first hand you want to for sure fast play? Which is the first hand hand you think about slow playing so let's let everyone know what's the first hand you definitely want to fast play jerome has a point especially for shorter stacks for other reasons but i want to talk about the nutted part that's why i asked for the nuts first and i got the the sets and top two answer so out of those which one you definitely want to fast play so yeah i should mention that that's for sure a range check so our fast playing option is the check race so eric maybe we get bottom set we get top set eric eric says sets which is tough because like the majority of that we have two combinations of two pair we are talking about right now the nine eight suited i guess and we have nine combinations of sets so if you say sets it's like nine out of the 11 combinations we are talking about that's a little much of an answer just just talk about the strong hand jerome goes to the bottom set remember we are not playing as the big blind we play cut cutoff versus bottom. And Sonny with the only right answer, right? Top set. We'll get to that. Usually the bottom set is nice because it unblocks top pairs and so on, but here actually, that's why I started asking what is nuts here. And the bottom set is like, if stacks go in the middle, it's very likely on the bad end of the cooler right so it's very questionable whether a bottom set is is nuts here right it's maybe nuts once someone doesn't raise because villain is incentivized to do the same and something like pocket nines here is very incentivized to fast play to get the money in the middle against freaking pocket 8s before there is the 7 of spades, the 10 of clubs, the 5 of spades, any other spades, a random queen, a random 10, a random 7, whatever, a random 5. Because this freaking smashes buttons range. We see buttons range here. Calling range in the cash game world here rather tight, would say really heavily around that nines eights tens seven sixes and i'll let villain do all his stabbing shit let him stab big actually and then we have a look at the fast plays against the big bet i think tens are like not really willing to put more money in it will be a mix i guess and then i want to have that look at how things are different nines eights and sixes Thanks for watching. like not really willing to put more money in it will be a mix i guess and then i want to have that look at how things are different nines eights and sixes and actually we open 10-7 suited from the cutoff so that's the first one and just looking at the sets because this is the big big learning here and we see how big the difference in ev is right so pocket nines almost 20 big plans in EV, pocket eights 15 and pocket sixes only 10. So you should be a different way of like, there should be a different way of happiness in your heart for flopping a certain set. So I can tell you already, this will be one of the golden rules. Fast play nuts over nuts, I call it. Slow play nuts under nuts. We can call the pocket sixes nuts. I'm fine with that. You flop the freaking set. But I'm more talking about are we likely, if the money goes in the middle, on the good end of the cooler now or on the bad end? And then just think about that if we track pocket nines now and we get the seven of spades on the turn, we check it down against pocket eights, we will hate our freaking life. If we do the same thing with pocket sixes, there's actually an upside in slow playing. Not because we slow play to get more money in later, but because, well, we might be on the bad end actually of the cooler already and our hand is not as strong as it seems. And we save money because of that dynamic board structure. So very, very clearly what we see here. And yeah, that's just a very different point I want you to start right away to get that out of the way. Nuts over nuts is way, way, way nicer than nuts under nuts. Always giving it some time, seeing people typing. I don't mind losing set over set any day. Well, but the feeling if you have nines and he has eights and you only get five big blinds in the middle, that's a really really bad one. And having that same feeling, having sixes versus eights and really keeping the pot small is a feeling you will love so okay first example i think very very clear just something to keep in mind that we can differentiate between the sets here right so you said tens fast playing obviously this is cool for for equity denial reasons not not play against the king jack bluff that villain has jack ten of sp spades, yes, we can fast play the shit out of it. It's like, we don't care, right? Ace is obviously the one that wants to keep everything in. We got bluff catching against sets at some point. But if villain is bluffing, he is likely something like King Jack that has very close to like 0% equity against us. So this is why we want to keep everything in. That's a really, the small equities that are going on there. All right, let's go next try. Monotone board. We'll talk about the flop. This time we are in position. Ace, King, four, all spades. And you can tell me already, what is the hand you love slow playing the most? So here we are, I'm asking for the most likely slow play. Ace, king, four, all, spades. We play button versus big blind. In our world, big blind won't dunk, so it's check to us. Jerome goes with the queen jack of spades. The freaking royal flush draws super nuts. Any other opinions? I'm not saying that's bad. Just reading out and asking for more answers. Anyone wants to maybe slow play the pocket aces? Who knows? Or the pocket fours? Anyone in for the pocket force slow play after after hearing about about bottom sets okay that was a trick question we definitely don't don't slow play pocket force okay let's see maybe maybe sometimes never say never pocket force we do bet right the money is not coming coming from losing to like kings and aces here it's we are we have a full house draw and we are fine getting at least two streets in depending on the the sizing and then do something later. We see the pocket aces. Super cool. We block the top pairs to death. There are not many top pairs left. We let villain first hit his king x2 pair maybe. Something like that. That's cool right? Or we can say it as well a little like the bottom set before. It's like if there's another spade coming, we are happy that we kept the pot small. It's also fine, right? And there's just not much value in betting right now. What is calling? It's like hands that have solid equity against us. And maybe not folding out the 7-8 of hearts is pretty strong here. And now coming to the flushes. What we usually see here is like the betting for the high-low, like the high-low meaning one high card, one low card, leaving all the other flush cards open to get calls from hands that draw to a second best hand or are already a second best flush. Like queen-deuce suited, I would say, is the highest frequency betting flush here with the certain rule I use and I learned through the solver. That's a queen do suited is just almost always betting. And then it should get a little less, little less, little less. And here we have wild mix like queen five, six, seven, that's the same, right? And then where is the most checking? Queen jack, we said that's close. Actually, I went with the queen jack would go with that so i think jerome gave the the perfect answer here for the flushes even though aces like to check a little more for for other reasons not the super nut reasons but here the queen jack may make sense right it's it's it's it's cool right so block everything to death we want we are more playing against we are not we don't have the queen high versus the jack high flush unfortunately and yeah we hope for villain to improve to straights to two pairs to whatever we get the money from and just blast in other spots as well so that makes sense but we see that how where's paint this year takes place there won't be new nuts coming yes the board can appear yes there can be a fourth spade, but that's not that many cards. Most cards, nothing freaking changes when we talk about nutted hands. So we need to keep nuts for later to be protected from super thin value bets. Now we learned two things at the same time. If people are not using big bet sizes, we don't need to protect anything. And the other way around, if people are betting their flushes always and we are the big blind we can just freaking hammer on them later. So here in theory if you check back you should have quite some flushes. Let's pull out a freaking brick and see that villain shouldn't hammer like crazy. There is no real overbetting going on. two 2% nothing really, nothing really right because in position is still protected. In reality, most stakes that I'm playing and that you guys are playing, you can invest on average way more money as the big blind here using way bigger sick bed sizes going way thinner for value. And just like use bigger sizing with all the flushes and obviously the bluffs also, just because people like betting flushes. Right. But this is the range wise explanation why we need to split things up. Okay. I see like I'm obviously taking way longer than I thought already. So maybe I skip one or two examples. Okay. Let's talk quickly about the third one. Ace-King-10 with two spades. Not really. I want to ask questions. Ace-King-10, sorry. 10. And I want to talk about... Did I write down a turn? No. I want to talk about a flush turn. Let's say here it starts on the flop already. I want to talk about that fact that when we are not talking about nuts, but like hands that want to build a certain pot size, like you're getting two streets in, but do not necessarily want to get the two first streets in. So they don't need to bet flop and turn, they rather wait. And here that is the two pairs, like a king 10, 10 for example right so king 10 here can already consider checking back on the flop let's be honest and i need to ask the question again who of you when was the last time any one of you checked back a two pair like that on the flop for me it was the last misclick probably last Last time you did that. More about never, right? So yeah, since we're not misclicking that often, never can use it, right? So it's like, it's really that the board will change. You have the value against an ace-axe. And actually this is more about saving money when the jack of spades falls. It's just your hand is not that strong as it looks like. And if you bet here, let's say you bet small size, that's fine with king 10, you get obviously called by that freaking ace. Turn is now spades. Get my face out of the way. Check and now I think we have a rather mandatory check. Oh, apparently not. Oh, the Oh, the king shouldn't be in spades, sorry. That's better. But not the perfect example, but still. You have seen the flop check, the turn check, and here it's like 50-50. And maybe some others as well. I mean, that's that six i ran the example a little differently where i had it a little more clear but i hope you get the point right that just here it makes a lot of sense to not just always be betting that exact hand strength we want to get exactly one more street in the middle and especially this is here something where if phil has a raising range, then it sucks to be betting a lot, right? Most people miss their raising range or they never have bluffs like the pocket sevens with a spade, for example, it's a nice bluff here. Yeah, if people don't do that, you can just bet, build the exact pot size you want to have and that check back but I want to show that and with that according to that, another the board 10 7 4 this year right so let's say button versus big blind 10 7 4 check we bet it's not a small bad board that much so we're betting half pot now and let's say we turn a straight on that six so we have eight nine suited what do you guys think is the betting frequency of 8-9 suited, obviously not having the straight flush? Just a number, the betting frequency of your 8-9 of clubs on the turn. We bet always. Okay. I GTO it's not 100%. I can tell you that. I hope I didn't mess up the example. I tested this one this morning. So I'm pretty sure still that I got the same board. Maybe it was the 10 and the four of hearts, but that shouldn't change much. So anyone who is risking an answer. Betting frequency on the turn of 8, 9 of clubs. 80%. All right, so get out there, make some mistakes, and that's where we learn the most from. Because that will lead us to certain topic that we didn't talk about that much so far. Okay, see the check. It is slightly different. Different actually before I got zero. Now we have like a 10 to 15%. I would guess there's high incentive to not be betting this hand. Any idea why that is the case? Yeah, you're out playing yourself a little. But I love the vibes. Reverse implied. Well, we are not stacking off here. Fourth hearts, we can check back maybe another another heart, maybe another brick. We bet fold, so it's fine for like three streets. Pot control against flushes. Yeah, we are scared. Maybe then we can react. Does he bet small on the river and we maybe can get a raise in or not? Okay, that will bring us to the slide that was planned. The examples are usually in between, but there was a slide, if you remember the plan for today, there was something like equities do still matter, right? So equities do still matter. Just write that down. The example didn't plan that like that, but it just fits perfectly. It's now that we think about two things. What do we get called by? And which hands do we fold out? And we said that in the beginning for incentives for slow and fast playing is that fast playing is incentivized if we even fold out a certain amount of equity. Everyone just folds out a random gutshot or whatever happens. And we have an incentive for slow playing if our hand is invulnerable, which here definitely is not the case. But if we think about which hands call our turn bet and which hands fold versus our turn bet. It might get really, really interesting. So yeah, let's just talk about calling range. Calling range is like obviously like some hands we beat, right? Like 10x we beat, but it's lots of here plus flush draw having like 20 versus us right then it is obviously flushes right 100 versus us then it is two pair having what is that four outs eight percent versus us and now the interesting part is what is will holding i don't even know which hands he's folding but i can tell you they all have zero percent and i could say he floats like diamonds he floats like a king seven no hearts he floats like whatever so actually this is a big problem here we all think about that he calls his 10 9 he calls, he calls his king 10 with a heart, which yes, we are ahead of that. That's beautiful. But they have solid equity versus us. It's absolutely right. Even against our hand, not just our range. And thinking about, we're not trying to get the money, all the money in the middle. That would be too much. And thinking about, okay, we fold out hands that we can gain way more right he can river another straight he is like jack nine no heart oh that's bad he turns a river is a better straight if he makes that that was a very bad example uh maybe he has a five six right then we get a river eight a river three very nice for us that without hearts i think he needs to part default that he can have king jack of diamonds he can have i don't know what like a king seven that river is a two pair so here this here i think the focus is clearly on that thing right like here our betting accomplishes small something here he calls hands that we are ahead of but it kind of kills all our good action all our good action and the check just like there's so much stuff that could happen like check check and i don't know let's let's get out like the three of clubs that's so every five makes a straight little overpets is freaking seven five beautiful like 130 we call our nine eight i think it's not strong enough to raise this is where where we make money. We get the river, king of diamonds. Obviously, he has bluffs in that line also. He has that freaking king. He has his king, jack, his king, queen. King, 10, 2 pair. Where's the king, 7 suited? Something like that. Might even go for the check raise. Stuff like that. Yeah. Bet, okay. 300% pot. Now we have a bluff catcher, still one that we call but this one is is one where we have the beautiful value call where he blocked bets and we know exactly where we are at and we put out a big race okay so something to not only like we love thinking about the good hands that everyone has but there's lots of value in people investing money with bad hands also, or people rivering turning a second best hand that then is ready to invest money that they would fold now. Okay, we want him to call Pierre Plissard and we blocked that. Oh, we also blocked that. Yeah, that's that. But that's only a small part. So clear point when you said nice one. All right. Great. I think this is a big learning for myself to just like, see it in that way. It's so clear when you think about it. At least I think that, but I think it's really tough in game to think about that. This part, right? Okay, cool. So that came up while we were talking. That felt great. And now let's all I'll skip the king, king 10, four. That's for you guys guys which king are we slow playing and so on what shouldn't we be slow playing we obviously never slow playing pocket force on the turn and so on but that's a rather whatever example the ace king deuce ace is another example like the three flush we're just the board is locked up let's quickly show that we can do a little 10-15 minutes longer than the hour. I'll do that here on the side. Ace-King-Deuce. And check what's the bet size we use. Very quick, very quick. Who tells me the bet size we use on Ace-King-Deuce button versus big blind with a flush draw? You don't need to use that. But what does GTO Wizard do? Overbet, we got the overbet, that's correct. So the 125% is your thing. Some others can play 150. It's just, yeah. We hammer on Willem's trouble right here. He has the straight draws. He doesn't have ace-king. He doesn't have kings. He doesn't have aces. Obviously, aces we can slow play. Ace-king is the first hand that needs to bet that amount. Deuces also, no slow playing. There's no freaking slow playing, just the Aces with the monster blocker incentives. So really, we need to do betting here. If we think about the range thought again, every card gives us new nuts. That's fine. So check, we bet big here. And now we lock up the freaking board with the Ace. If we have we have it invulnerable and now this is the beautiful spot where even against passive players we can trap because same thing like the eight nine and this is interesting it's the same thing just on another level not on like a medium strong hand level but on the nut level that yeah we don't expect villain donking to be honest here but villain has lots of draws that he would fold on the turn that are drawing to second best hand let's say we have ace king yes we can build a pot and charge his ace five but we can also check hope for him to hit a spade hope for him to make a, hope for him to make a Broadway straight. Lots of options. He has all those hands in his range. Or bluff because he doesn't expect us to check back. Obviously ace-queen, still vulnerable, right? Not locked up is the first, but always, always, always needs to bet. You can look at the EV difference of checking. We're losing a lot of money. Kings, no way we are slow playing. Unblocking the ace-axe. Deuces, no freaking way we are slow playing. Ace is absolute mandatory slow play. Ace-king, very optional slow play. And this is just what can happen, right? Even against the passive guy, we get the freaking 10 of spades. He reverses straight and he reverses flush, and he will invest money and very likely he's not realizing how well relatively weak his low flushes or how ranges play here. You see like he should bet 20% very often here. People will, this is what I mean. I will use that word later. People are over investing with their hand strength, right? So many people put you maybe even on a king or a weak ace and just put out like a 150% bet with their nine seven of spades. They river the flush. I can see it. It feels great. Obviously, this bet is absolute dog shit. And you sit there and you have your ace king still ready. And your ace tens. And well, you're one combination of aces when you're lucky so just showing that where it absolutely makes sense and this is here again the same that we learned in the little paint game that we know on the river there won't be any new nuts we have the super nuts now on the turn we can split them up they will stay super nuts it's like there is nothing on the right side of ace king like Like,, it doesn't get better. So this is something why we don't need to leverage all our advantage. We can split it up, use some of it on the turns, use some of it on the river. And also something to keep in mind, this is the beautiful board for river bluffs. We have the advantage. Everyone knows it. No one expects it But then they believe it again if he takes his flush I mean you can take your freaking a6 and I think you should actually never call but you can really smash it in here in His face. It's so incredibly believable that you have your trap boat because you had your advantage and they just played incorrectly Playing not that strategy here. So just a little collective thought. Okay, now rushing a little through coming to the golden rules, I hope equity still matter. We talked about that. Let's browse through that quickly again. Which hands are we playing against? Think about both calling and folding. Think about that part, how much equity are we folding out? That's always a part even if you have the strongest hands possible how much equity you fold out is a part that gives your bet ev instead of the check check and they sometimes river a straight sometimes river a flush river a set whatever if they are drawing to second best hand with all those cents well maybe you want to keep them in if well they only invest money if they make like their best hand and and they actually have that equity against you you're rather bad right so really this we don't have nuts we have nuts that have like 80 percent can get outdrawn by a flush draw that have 92 percent because they are only gut shots on a rainbow board 94 percent whatever is a three outer or 100% like the ace king. What is our desired pot size, the weaker value like the nine eight or the king 10 example two streets, something like that we can achieve that. And yeah, do we follow up billions equity or not talk about that. And think about it's not 8% equity of the pot size, it's often about all the money that goes in the middle, right? So let's say we have maybe 30 big blinds in the middle on the turn, but potentially 200 big blinds in the middle on the river. So 8% of those 200 is another 16 big blinds. It's like half of the pot on the turn in that random example I just made up. But this is a huge, huge, huge amount when it really is about you have a set and you potentially get out drawn by a gut shot right slow playing your pocket deuces on ace king deuce six is an absolute disaster right just showing that and then losing to the river broadway straight or wheel or whatever and saying it's a it's a cooler and so that's a very very big point all right let's go to the next at Broadway Strait or wheel or whatever and saying it's a cooler. And so that's a very, very big point. All right, let's go to the next one, the golden rules. First thing, dynamic boards mean we get new nuts on the turn most of the time because always is always wrong. But in those ones, we don't need to like spear, save some nuts for the next street. We always, always fast play dynamic boards. Let me give you a quick example. Where are we? Cut up versus big blind works fine. We take our 10, 7, 4 that we had before. And this time it's an offsuit queen on the turn. So now we know the turn check, or not overbet, we bet like, let's take a 50% on the flop, call, queen of clubs on the turn. We know on the turn that on any 5, 6, 8, 9, jack, king, ace, 10, 3, nuts will change. So no way we check back our queens, 10s or 7s or something like that. And we see that. It's really no way. There's actually these, like, checking pocket fours loses you five big blinds. Checking pocket sevens loses you almost five big blinds. Checking pocket tens, well, here we have a little lookalike, right? You're only losing one big blind. If you want to mess up one of those, you check back the pocket tens. Pocket queens queens, losing two and a half big blinds. Something like that. Queen 10, like, hell no. We are not trapping a board like that. We don't need nuts for the river. We will get them. Our shit will make something. We check back king jack sometimes. We cover nine. We cover an ace. We check back, obviously, some flushes. Flush draws, I mean. So very, very, very very very clear never never slow play dynamic boards always fast play deep stack in position very important if the way is very long to get all the money in the middle sometimes yes again always always wrong but yeah even that ace king spot it's a little more sexy to get it in boat over boat than waiting for like a flush to invest a little more right a river flush something like that really the big money is there in the big stacks so if we play 200 big blinds deep actually i would stop like really the exception needs to be so huge that we that we stop fast playing something that start slow playing. And then we have that nuts over nuts thought. On the other hand, if you think about slow playing or pot controlling in that moment, take the weakest of your nuts. That makes sense. So really here, fast play dynamic boards, fast play deep stack, fast play the super nuts when the board is dynamic. Slow play is an absolute exception and I want you to see that. This is why those golden rules are so important. I didn't want to give that lesson and that substitute to tell you to slow play fancy and so on. No, you are leaving so much money on the table. People are not crazy, especially on lowest stakes. Some are, they donate their stack to you by calling, by doing stupid stuff. Okay, that's fine. But that's never a reason to slow play. Slow plays, the exception needs good reasons. Monster blockers, if you have top quads, cool. But still, if you have sixes on 6-6-3, there's so much more going on than villain having a six, so you should still bet small. That's the wrong spot for a slow play. You have a crazy attacking villain that just is willing to put lots of money in the middle, but I want to have that clear read first. Or out of position, you can have unfavorable runouts, especially deep. Actually, I see it that way that you know you will get in trouble later, even though you have a good hand now. And then you rather get in trouble in a small pot than in a big pot. So maybe one last example for that as well. Let's make it clear for more positional disadvantage 200 big blind steep. Cut off raises we call in the big blind and we get a board that has lots of opportunities for the cutoff. Queen Jack five with a flush strong And you are so lucky and you flop top two. Queen, jack, beautiful check raise. Get the money in, right? Yes, sure, you can do that. But still you hope for not seeing an ace, not a king, not a 10, not a heart, not a nine, not an eight on the turn. And you're playing very deep stack out of position. So let's say villain bets. the good bet size here on the uh flop or big bet size let's take a normal that's not a perfect example let's take this one and we see that our queen jack rather waits rather waits call and then if the turn is the king of hearts ten of hearts we just are happy to play a small pot but if it it's the deuce of diamonds, then we can go crazy, right? Villain will overbet his freaking kings. Should do so. And now we have the nuts, right? So what's the bet size here? This here, one of those. Let's take the 125. That's very realistic, I think. And now we can check our steal. Lots of trouble on river. So we rather slow play again. Obviously, we block calling range. But you see see this is out of position special on dynamic boards where we don't have the super nuts right fives is way stronger here get in the fives versus the queen jacks and it's really getting getting down to a couple of combos every time okay so very important feel free to ask last question questions while i go to key takeaways, which is kind of repeating the same thing here. Just it's so important. And so one more thing I didn't mention on the exploitative. I thought key takeaways, there's more exploitative thoughts. I wrote down so much today. When people tell you they have it and we beat them, then fast play. That's very easy. It's very easy. Maybe I tell you. Oh, where is it? This one. This is Kings versus Aces. But still, it should be in one of the videos that you should see soon. So before bets, someone I've never seen before, an L50 or an L100, I don't know. And he just bombs that board. And I know he has it. Like, why should I wait until there's a 9 or Jack and he maybe gets away from something? So we rip it, right? When you know they have it, there's no way they have a bluff and we get it in it seems so easy but a call would be a huge mistake here i think on the on the flop okay very easy example then when people this is a long sentence very bad but i couldn't improve it when people are not over investing versus our weakness the only reason to slow play is them potentially improving to a second best hand. The example we had that even works against passive players. We know they aren't on a draw, we have the pot locked up, and the only way they invest more money is hitting something, we can keep them in the pot. That's it. Then people value betting too thinly are our slow play victims this is why we talked about what do we need protection for this is the type of players if people are value betting too thinly us slow playing kills them that's it because they are investing too much money with shitty hands right there are a lot like some some players out there that actually find the very like versus the pool very good thin value bets but the folds also right that if you bet they fold but if you check they go incredibly thinly for big value but this is really really rare occasions okay cutoff versus button on 986 rainbow we check raise nines or we. We always check raise nines, always get it in versus eights and sixes because this is because of tight ranges. And yeah, we know how those hands play. So the value is there. We are not that scared of Yeah, if there is a 10, it's fine, but we still get the money in versus pocket ace. And we slow play the sixes. Oh, sorry, rainbow. I think so. Yeah. Maybe we don't need Sorry, I misread your question but let's look that up that's a very good question because it's changing one of the incentives right so they're not that many bad turn cards but still some so i think it's still the rule that sorry wrong cut off button calls the rule that the top set is more interested in in check raising but we could see a little less check raising overall still the range check let's go with a 50 step any sizing is fine and we see the same pattern nines get the money in the middle it's a a little less, sixes almost never. They're actually very clear, same thing. All right, now getting to the key takeaways. Slow plays are exceptions. This is what I want. I know there was a lot of input in those 70 minutes. should definitely re-watch that on the platform but i think there was lots of good stuff in there so i tried to break it down to the most important stuff slow plays are exceptions we should find the value by betting the fast playing we have it they call that's fine don't slow play to bluff catch later right you should be brave enough put the balls out here really, if people are bluffing too much, you make the bluff catch. You have whatever hand, you beat bluffs, you click the freaking call button. It's really, really bad to only check back aces to then click and they have five high. It's like, yeah, cool, great that you wasted your freaking aces. And then only slow play invulnerable nuts. You don't want to be the guy slow playing because you're strong and you want them to stay in the middle when actually they are only investing big money when they will hit their their low equities like a gut shot or something like that or a better set like something like that so really invulnerable nuts are the first ones we want to think about slow playing and still they stay exceptions, right? Super monster blockers, or a villain only sitting on draws that improve to a second best hand. Not bad, but check raise no cutoff versus button 986 is a range check. Villain has way more sets with his tighter range. So we need to give him the betting lead and he should do lots of betting. So this way we get more money with our strong hands. Yeah. all right let's put out any more questions in in the discord then i hope you enjoyed that session i feel like it was it was a little packed but i hope you still enjoyed it and yeah feel free to reach out on discord suzu i will get back to you very soon and yeah i have no more traveling now so i'll be lots lots at home in the office so you can expect more videos or feel free I'll be lots, lots at home in the office. So you can expect more videos or feel free. I'll answer more in Discord again than in the summer. It's getting a little colder here. And now I think the low times are over and it's time to put some effort into our game again.
