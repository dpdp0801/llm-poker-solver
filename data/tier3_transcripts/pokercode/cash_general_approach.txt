### TOPIC: cash general approach
 Hello. So it seems like we are quite a small group today. So make even more use of that by just asking questions whenever that is the case. I gave you the analogy of like, we are being kind of a class. Okay. I'm the teacher, but still you guys are all classmates and it's easy to talk to me, not like back in, back in school. And yeah, make use of that. You can talk to each other in the chat, make sure to write to everyone and not just me when you send a message and then we can make that a fun afternoon and and learning a lot hopefully as well all right so i am just reading from tom mon three minutes ago who had really great input in in the in the little thread i made about today's coaching so we will work hard on on on the questions he asked because i guess that was was very very good stuff so if you're watching the recording now tom then this will be for you it's a little sad that you can't be here that he cannot be here but things happen i know it's it's freaking 3 p.m in the afternoon but i need to be done before the 6 p.m matches and i have a one hour drive ahead of me so you know first things first first things first. Yeah. So that's for everyone watching the recording. It's still the Euros and maybe you know, the story already in Germany busted versus Hungary. I hope not. Let's see. And I guess we are ready to go, right? If you are ready, I am. Don't worry if I look a lot at that screen, this is where the chat is. I try to keep an eye open on that. It's different than the coachings I did together with Simon where, well, you have two people looking at stuff, so I might get a little distracted, but we'll start today's topic. And actually this is something I want to do that I forgot is the one that you chose taking a deeper look at the general concept. And what I'm doing right now on the side is actually logging in to our awesome platform to just go through that rather quickly. Let's see. Awesome face of Fedor. Let's switch to cash game. Oh, we got there already. 4% of the course. I didn't work that through. I hope you enjoyed the introduction, got the little overview there. So I will just talk lots of general stuff today since it's the very very first community coaching for the cash game side it is not about cash game today actually it is about general concept general approaches so this is pretty much for everyone but still i want to catch all you guys that signed up for the cash game now in the last month and make it for you and yeah we'll start focusing on this part here you chose the general concepts pre-flop and post-flop post-flop was like a good second place we'll have more looks there as well if you didn't check that out already last week we released already the next theory video 24 minutes on fundamentals part two i split that up into two. So if you missed that and just binge watched the whole show on the start, and you feel like there wasn't anything new since then, check out this video. And now let's go to the general concept. So I just put the introduction there. That's obviously not a concept. That is just something that needs to be there. I want to, I want to take your hand and show you around a little what my thought process is behind the structure. Again, this is not a course of 100 hours of videos and stuff. I don't want to overload it and I wouldn't enjoy the process at all either. So we start with that, I guess like 20, 25 videos and I will put more out there. I have something in the pipeline for you though. So don't worry about that. Yeah, I hope you enjoyed that. If there are any questions regarding that, feel free to fire, but I guess that's covered pretty well. And now we'll start looking at the first of the real concepts, right? I named a general approach because actually before we get to the table, I'm thinking about, hey, what should we focus on? And we'll have a look at those three questions, especially, I think we skipped this here. This is pretty obvious. This is just my answer to a question. Rock, paper, scissors. I'm not really sure. I will use that example quite often when we talk about reads and how to exploit. We will talk a lot about how do I study or how to study in general today. And I'm not sure whether that makes the cut, but let's see. So this is the first topic that we are starting today. And yeah, let's jump into it with the my three questions. So I don't have a price, but I would be very proud of the first one, the fastest one who can write down my three questions in the chat right now right 10 seconds should do the thing right i'm looking at the chat go ahead what i wrote down here is just like i shouldn't need to write that down anymore right so gustavo here we go let's freaking go come on come on number two. One more. You got to try harder, right? So what is the correct play? What is Willem doing wrong? What are the potential exploits? I don't know whether that was the exact question, but what is the right exploit? That is all fine. And I hope, right, I will repeat that pretty much in any coaching session, because every time we look at a hand or something, this structure will be part of it. And by having that, we already covered the whole GTO versus exploitative topic already, because we need to look at both sides. We need to know the freaking baseline to then see how villain deviates, to then keep going and know and prepare the right exploits so i will hammer that in your heads that's like like the alphabet that you learn in school right so this is just you will need it whenever you write down anything yeah so this is the first slide i hope this was a little little fun to start i don't have a kahoot quiz today. Still try to be active. Shoot messages anytime. I'm having one eye on that side there. And yeah, let's see what is next. And I guess we get to the first question. Very, very great question that came in, well, 20 hours ago. So yeah. And this is just the question regarding my three questions. So let's go through that step by step. Tom asks here regarding the what would be right. I'd like to hear more about how do we know or even agree what is right? Where should my time be spent when trying to find out what is right? All solvers, changing solvers, input can change what is the correct output right so i don't know whether that is a perfect sentence but we get it right looking at other good players winning players is an option and yeah just wrote down there to not lose track some that i want to give you some some thoughts and and want to put that in some type of context so first of all we are living in a poker world where lots of part situations are solvable, right? So it's not like we are guessing, right? It's like, yeah, CBET is good because we can represent a strong hand. Yes, it's somewhat true, but we know more about that. So often, we do not know what is right exactly, but we know in which direction things are going. And actually, the other way around, we can often say when something is clearly wrong. So this can be stuff that, okay, I focus mainly on coming to one of the other parts that was actually part of the building a wardrobe i focus always first on action game remember that action game reaction game action game means we are setting the parameter we are forcing villain to play under our framework in like using our parameters so this is the first step where we can say he's doing something wrong if i'm three betting cutoff versus mp and i'm c betting and i know exactly how my range structure looks like and he calls a hand that is never a call he is making a mistake so i could make the note well we are just here at what would be right. We know what would be right. And therefore we will find out how that villain made a mistake. So this can be right. Focus on the action game. So let's go step by step again. How do we know or even agree what is right? When we set the parameters, we set the framework, we can easily say what is right and what not. This is the end set the framework. We can easily say what is right and what not. This works there. When we look at the reaction game, we could often disagree with what Willem is doing. Let's say Willem Cibet's small on a certain board where we would bet big ourselves. Is it a mistake? Maybe. Is it not? We don't know because we don't know his framework. If it's for us the reaction game, villain is setting the framework and if he does it in a different way, maybe it's just a simplification. I wouldn't say it's clearly wrong. But if he makes a bluff catch with a hand that is just not beating some of our bluffs, for example, that could be still super wrong. So it's really that there is, given the framework around it, there's multiple answers that could be right. And in the perfect world, we would put in 100 different sizings in the solver, and then there's only one correct answer. but we are not there yet, right? We cut it down to one, two, three options, and it depends what the right answer is on those options that we are giving. Yeah, so I want to make that clear difference. Our action game, super easy to spot villains' mistakes. His action game, well, we need to find out his wardrobe, his framework. What what does he do and there it's a little tougher to really go over that threshold to say okay that that is right or that is incorrect okay where should my time be spent when trying to find out what is right is it all solvers is it change well changing the solvers to have different correct outputs, looking at other good players, winning players? As I said already, there's pretty much more than one correct. And your job is to choose the one that you prefer the most. This is so, so, so important because it's like, okay, we can discuss about something like, oh, now I'm getting in in the wardrobe topic right away we can discuss whether we want to use a small bet only or a small and a big bet but then the turn and river game tree will will deviate so actually both of them can be correct one is just a simpler version and it's your choice to make why wait do you think you have more ev your skill compared to villain skill how much did you check out this game tree so choose one and then know it because once you know it it is your action game you can see again what is right and wrong looking at villains reactions another thing is really to get that input from good players, from winning players. And if you're watching, shout out to him, Jared Mann's Zoom 500 videos on YouTube, I think they are awesome. Or you are sometimes watching the Wacko, the Wocko, I don't know, René's show from Poker Ambition on Twitch. He's actually like, I had a Skype call with him and it was so mind blowing how close our thoughts about poker are in general. He's more, it's called the Weco show, right? He's giving a show. He's choosing fancy lines. He's trying to build a very, very complex wardrobe often. I don't know whether he does, he was never a grinder. So I don't know too much about his standard game, if it even exists, right? But he is digging deep there and trying to, yeah, put villain into trouble. Still, well, maybe using less simplifications, but correct, definitely, right? Definitely making mistakes too, right? As I am making mistakes and every other good player is making mistakes. But this is how I want you to see it. There are multiple options that are correct. You can choose one. Really, our goal is way more to not totally mess up, right? That is something, well, checking back bottom set in position as the aggressor is just a 0% thing in every strategy. if it's not a simplification that a board is zero percent that you go for the check only in position, but then actually you should only do that when it's villain's action game. And now it's the doorbell ringing again. Whoever that is, I'm not expecting anything. And if it's Amazon, they should come back tomorrow. So I'll stick with you guys and drink my last sip of coffee. So I was talking about multiple options that could be correct. So it is just having an idea of that is important. And yeah, then simplify it to your version. Okay, I hope that clears the question a little. Yeah, I mean, Tom is not here right now, so he won't be able to answer later. And yeah, if there are any more, feel free to use the chat. Let's go. I have one eye on there. And if not, I'll just keep going. And the next step is this question about the second question. What is villain doing wrong wrong could you maybe give a walkthrough example of how to determine villain is doing something wrong maybe they are doing something wrong by my ranges or strategy but correct under another strategy you see again we get to something my strategy his strategy whatever right it's about the framework sometimes people are just like doing bullshit right if i see an a6 off open race from early position that is just wrong so easy to find out sometimes there's it's like in between it can be okay in a certain strategy maybe it's wrong in another. And we need to understand that there's like lots of room, right? It's not like right or wrong, but there's like lots of stuff in between where sometimes we can say something is clearly wrong. Sometimes we can only say it's likely to be wrong. And maybe other times we just don't know, depends on his strategy. So again, focus on your action game. You are setting the parameters. Things can change when Willem takes over initiative and check raises. Well, then it's his parameters again. But first of all, if it's like, well, mainly he's calling or folding that decision, we can see whether that is right or wrong. We can just put in our parameters and have an idea right we can have an idea of like which sizing might be better or worse and then it's not necessarily wrong but maybe he's well he's playing differently than we would in his shoes that's like often a good idea to think about okay and yeah i'll put in the what is the right exploit in that as well because we'll i'll give you an example review of a couple of hands and that leads to right that thing of right wrong and lots of room in between leaves us room for like how far to exploit if i know something someone is clearly doing something wrong let's say he's never folding a river. Like extreme example. Even with Eir. He's calling because he loves seeing the showdown. Well, I'm just value betting if I have the equity against his full range. Okay. I'm never bluffing, obviously. That would be kind of easy and a massive exploit. Maybe next villain is just calling when he has a mate hand which means in certain spots he's still folding 20 30 40 percent maybe even so maybe we exploit that in a little different way that we go let's say super big when we have it but we can still bluff with small sizings to fold out as weaker draws. So whatever. And then, and then there are lots of reads in between. Okay. So let's go to that example review. Actually, I opened up, where is it? I played one session or a couple of sessions yesterday. Let's have a look. So I hope that is big enough for you guys. I cannot make it bigger somehow. So I marked a couple of hands. You see, I played like 1,800 hands yesterday. I made some money, so that is all good. Don't worry about that. And I just marked random hands. Okay. And now I want to take you through it with a focus on what would be right, what is villain doing wrong, and what is the right exploit. Okay. I open raise. Perfect. In my strategy, action game, I'm open raising. He calls. Perfect. Right? No mistakes so far. I have multiple options, but I go with a high CBET frequency and small sizing. I use the 25% sizing only. Action game. My game. He decides now to take over initiative and check raises. This should be like a 60% sizing. I'm always counting in percentages, not like 4x, 5x. Totally fine, right? Diamonds, backdoor straight draw. Why not? Having more 7x. He chooses this sizing. I go with a smaller one. I would have went with half pot, which means I'm check raising to 2470, which I prefer that because it gives more trouble to cut off weaker hands. But that's not a difference. That's like now this is my correct, and I don't know whether it's correct. It's a simplification to just one size. And he's taking this one or this one. I don't know. I guess I choose the 50% because I like it more than the bigger size. So I make mine closer to the right and his a little more maybe a little wrong. I don't know, but there is no right or wrong. Okay now I call turn is an ace. So that is a great card for in position improving to aces. Well that's it pretty much and some other stuff but mainly it doesn't connect at all with big blind's check raising range right yeah he could have something like nine ten eight six of hearts and have like some something like that as an eight or a nine would be a worse card adding equity to villains check raising hands And And now I in his shoes would be on overbet or check. I have a seven or I'm full of shit. I have nothing in between. I'm not like, I don't want to value bet my ace in his shoes here. It doesn't make any sense. So, and this is now where we see like, is that a mistake or a potential mistake? even, we see the scroll again that I like to have a look at. This is not a preset sizing of like 63% or something. So, hmm, is he maybe just looking at a flush draw and wants to see the next card without risking too much? I don't know, right? I think this just doesn't give me as much trouble as it should because he's either playing only that sizing and then misses value with his 7x or he has a clear sizing tail here and maybe goes big with the 7 and wants to i call that buying cards for cheap yeah so that is now the first step where i say okay he's potentially doing something wrong and I could make a note now or should actually, but I won't do that now. I'm like, okay, potentially just like sizes his hand strength draw a thing on boards where he should overbet. okay so call river nothing gets there he decides to give up his flush draw which is totally fine i easily win with my king high so a pretty standard hand it seems like but on the turn i have good chances to figure out stuff and this is the like thinking about what would i do what is villain doing differently why do i do what i'm doing and why do i prefer that the other time i might find out something and see like hey this is cool i would never do that and double check it with a find out something and see like, hey, this is cool. I would never do that. And double check it with a solver. It would be something now, if you're not as sure as I am in that spot, double check it. Put that one in there. Give it multiple turn options and see which sizing is preferred. And then you have an answer, pretty much. Which framework is better? OK. Nice. Easy. King high. Next one. pretty much right which framework is better okay nice easy king high next one i hope raise a little looser because of a weak table and big line defense so far so good pocket tens versus mp not often a three bet and i see that he calls i go again with a high frequency small bet actually i'm overdoing it here this is not a hundred percent c-bet board but no why I'm talking about that it's action game I want to know my strategy and this tells me I know which hands I have probably against that villain I have all hands and I'm betting full range makes it quite easy he calls turn is three. Okay. Maybe you have watched my community coaching regarding turn betting. Big and polar. This is a perfect example. Willem doesn't improve a shit. Maybe two combinations of four three suited. Maybe some pocket threes. That's really not much. So I'm looking for a value threshold now where I start over betting. I know that is my only sizing. I am not sure whether I go with king jackjack plus or king-queen plus and obviously all kinds of air, but king-six is for me a two-street value hand. I got my first street. I want to have one more. I don't really need to deny equity. There's only one overcard and cool. I check it back and decide on the river now this is very interesting he reverses freaking set what would you guys do now this is a question for you what do you guys do in his shoes with your pocket tens here i give you 20 seconds okay we get the first check raise from Silas. Check from Geduld, bitte. Okay, check, check, check, check, check. Bet large from Sebarino, all right. Bet big. Overbet from Hannes. Yeah, sure, be fancy. Check raise. Okay, let me ask you another question. What do you do with your ace of spades, 10 of clubs? Block betting, block betting, block betting. Bet myself, I think that is probably better against clubs in 2-3-1. 10x strong enough for block bet probably. Small bet, also over bet. Okay. So, hmm. Why am I asking you for the ace of spades, 10 of clubs? It's pretty much the same hand regarding blockers, right? I could ask you for the ace of spades, 10 of diamonds, for example, as well, or the ace of diamonds, 10 of diamonds, which should be all, right? I hear the lookalike principle for the first time. I didn't make a video out of that so far that will follow soon. I'm pretty sure of that, but I'm mentioning that all the time when looking at the hand histories. Not saying that we necessarily have to play those hands the same way. It just makes sense. We can obviously take our ace 10 as a check call as well. That makes totally sense to check raise our 10s large. Now let's nail and let's dig on Hannes, right? So we have our community manager in here, right? So Hannes, you wanted to overbet your pocket tens. What are you trying to achieve? What do you want to get called by? Oh, he doesn't like that. I think he left now. Maybe someone else helps him. Okay. I think I have a lot of air as well. So want to want to be polar okay you do it bitter gives the answer exactly your weak king x so first of all what hannes writes is totally right right away as five six six seven busted flush draws five seven suited so there's lots of reason for in position to be bluff catching and this is the reason why i as the big blind would always overbet my king queen and my king jack and my king nine, for example. But pocket tens just have way, way, way more value. So the worst outcome is to bet big and get called by a king, actually, because you didn't give yourself the chance to win more. So with tens, I'm looking as at like hey how do i get the most value out of that and hmm a king bets itself right so i don't need to over bet and then a king has an easy call and does everything right obviously i can get a little more value out of a four that might be catching but versus mp there's not too much so actually i like the bet, which forces a king to raise and then re-raise over the top. Or I check, get a king to bet, and then I re-raise over the top. So when I'm thinking, OK, I want to attack a king, then I think about what is a king doing? And just betting and getting a king to call is definitely not my goal. If he checks here, I'm betting three quarters pot. He can check raise 150% pot, go crazy. Right. So yeah. Now the blocking is something you would see a lot in the solvers, but it's dangerous on low stakes because I would have been, I would have raised my king here, but 95% of the players would just call. And would be the the worst outcome actually if you block bet your tens and then a king only call so he did this year a random half pot sizing where i thought about okay i'm raising a block i'm not sure what to think of that random half pot from someone who plays 28 8 over 40 hands so i was more like he's probably not the guy who value bets his 10x thin enough he might just have king nine so i decided against the the race and just called and just seeing that coming back to the topic is like hmm what did he do wrong yeah first of all i know now that his half pot is strong. He got the minimum value out of those hand categories. And I can probably be sure that if he really blocks something, he always has the hand he represents. Okay, that was another example. I have one or two more. Let's have a look that are even easier. I think this is the easiest one here. Let's take a look at that one. Now coming back again, what was our goal to find out? It's super fun to watch lots of hand histories. I know that, and I lose track of everything that was planned. I could make a whole recession review with you guys maybe at some point. But this year, we were at what is right, what is villain doing wrong, and what is the right exploit, right? So what is right? We had the question, how do we find that out often multiple things are right and that is totally true and what is villain doing wrong we need to right i want to have a comparison between what would i be doing what is villain doing differently and why is my strategy better i want to always know why that is better if not i should play the same that villain does Willen does. So this is a pretty easy one, right? We got Cloudy's 1759, and him or her is flatting a small bind with Queens. And then check calling against a small bet here. Okay, that seems reasonable. Check raising should be fine as well. Check, check, and now I actually think about folding facing that small bet from that type of player. So yeah. Why is he calling? So this is definitely a very, very, I mean, I'm just calling here. Like I don't see the bluff, small blind, flatting range, super, whatever. This can be, I don't know that guy, 25, 13. So I raise my ace, any ace, but that's it. And yeah, cool. But flatting Queens is the perfect example for, this is definitely incorrect to put Queens in your flatting range here, right? This is something as like, maybe we can find a strategy where Queens make a 5% call, but this is very far away from like what is right. And this is something we know nowadays. Okay. Maybe one more. oh, very interesting one because I'm going berserk in this one. I can't wait for that. So I'm open raising a6 suited, middle position flats. So I'm playing three bet only in that spot, right? It's still four people behind. It's not really a thing in cash games. He can play a total of like, let's say seven, 8% here. If he wants to split it, good luck, right? Then he's not playing ranges anymore. He's just playing a couple of combinations. What do you guys now, let's make it a question out of that again. What do you think his flatting range is here? We have a thousand hands. He is a regular 24, 19, 10% three bet. Thank you. now let's make it a question out of that again. What do you think his flatting range is here? We have a thousand hands, he is a regular, 24-19, 10% 3-bet, and actually there's no reason to flat. Like there's a good player in the big blind, there's no extra reason on the table to start flatting wider here. Give me a real range, not like I see for his pocket pair that is obviously in there, really write down, because I said, he's a good player. He knows that he can only play 7% or 8% here. And if he breaks that down into 3-bet and call, well, there's really just a few combinations left. Really write down the combinations. So we got, he do it with queen 10 suited, jack 10 suited, aces. Everyone is always scared of the trap. Let's forget that no one is trapping aces there. Silas sixes through to tens. Queen-jack and king-queen suited. All right. Gustavo deuces to tens. Not if he's playing 24 and 19. Like no way he's flatting something worse than sevens, I would say for example. Fröbel, I like this one a lot. Sevens through to 9s, Jack-10, King-Jack, right? Maybe the 7s through to 10s, 8s through to 10s, but really we are getting down to those combinations, just a few. Sebarino as well, 5s through to 8s, and Jack-10 suited. If he's playing that loose, his stats would look differently. 24-19 is tighter than my stats, and I'm playing a 7.5% three-bet only strategy here. 19 is is tighter than my stats and i'm playing a 7.5 three bet only strategy here he is overall tighter than that but he's splitting so my assumption was something like ace jack suited eights nines tens king queen suited something like that maybe it's a misclick yes but then then that's the case so what happens Thank you. something like that maybe it's a misclick yes but then then that's the case so what happens he calls i'm saying he has never fives he has never aced jack off he's maybe low frequency king jack and queen jack suited he freaking all the time has eights nines and tens like that's pretty much my opinion here and i'm ready to like this is now a very strong exploit because well i'm very very sure that his range looks the way it is all right so siberino knows what's going to happen all right tell us let us know siberino knows what's happening over bat the triple bang bang no why we're playing versus tens nines and eights so obviously i'm checking here but that's so it's like and because he stabs those cents and i mean this is totally out of this world so this is a really really strong exploit and this is just because my read is that strong i know lots i mean i haven't played that guy for ages but i have played millions of hands versus players who play 24 and 19 and know what they fled from mp so we got the check race here obviously actually i don't size up too much here because i like him to call his tens and nines once or twice like i know he won't call that down for stacks. No way. One thing is like that. I wouldn't do that with random bullshit, but the ace of spades is kind of a key card here. If I say ace-jack suited, could be one of his only jacks he's ever having. All right, seven. And actually, I don't think he bet called sevens just because it's his weakest pocket that he could have if he's not folding that preflop. So I prefer to see a four or a three, but the seven, I don't care. What else could he have? Flush draws. All right. So I keep going. And actually, the river card is one that I love to see. It takes queen jack suited out of the equation as well. One more, right? Queen jack of diamonds, not out there anymore. So, and well, actually even his freaking king jack is a pure catcher by now. And well, I'm just ripping it in there. He has like king, queen of clubs, ace, queen of clubs, or he has tens and nines. And that's just it, right? So I guess I have, I would say like 70 like 70 plus fold equity here and this is just an example where well obviously no one is doing bullshit like that so it's fine to flat that kind of hand strength because no one is doing anything about it another thing i would be doing would be flop is 10 9 8 i check fold aces it's really that i know his freaking hand i don't have to think i have an overpeer whatever right so clear reads can come to clear exploits and this is the whole process what would be right my opinion is you shouldn't be flatting here and if you should still need to mix ranges but this is not what happening what is villain doing wrong he well he doesn't play a range he plays a few combinations what is the right exploit when his few combos do not hit a shit i go massively crazy if the river was a nine or a ten i block bet to fold out his flush draws just for the loads yeah that's it and if the river is a ten i don't see the nine pocket nines catches it's i think i i always get away with the block bet i need 25 20 fall equity and should have more than that okay maybe one last one very interesting because it's the same player pocket sixes and that's a low frequency three bet and he has shown that he is three betting from mp now he's flat like i mean he's three betting a low frequency three bet that he should 3-betting from MP. Now he's flat, like I mean, he's 3-betting a low frequency 3-bet that he should flat most of the time if he's playing a flatting range. Just important to note. Now that would be really again where it's very close. I cannot say that this is wrong or right, no clue. I see that he checks that back. I think he can bet his full range if he wants on that board. Sixes can obviously check back, not having a diamond even totally fine. And I just go for small and big on that run out. On the turn, I have multiple options. But again, that would be one example where I cannot learn too much from his whatever, from his play. Okay, so that was it. A little example review. I hope you you enjoyed that and i drink a little something here and yeah don't go crazy with your a6 suited right so on lower stakes maybe those freaking you need the read first right not me saying well they only have nines and tens when they are there gustav was probably totally right with this range if he writes down pocket deuces to pocket tens. If a player, let's say from Asia on GG poker, flats there on NL 10, then don't go crazy. We need the read first, and then we can go and exploit to the maximum. Okay, let's see what is next. So even going a little deeper into that, what is the right exploit? I showed you again, or I want to show you again, something that I used in my community coaching about reviewing hands already, and I called it the pyramid of reads. So it's really, it should show step-by-step how much a read can be worth. There was a question in Slack in the community coaching thread about Thank you. Show step by step how much a read can be worth. There was a question in Slack in the community coaching thread about it's super tough for me to have those reads and how to evaluate it. And I don't know how far to go. And this is where I cannot give you an answer because this is the beautiful thing in poker. It's like using rock, paper, scissor as an example again. I meet freaking Taylor on the streets. I know he's American, but nothing else about it. So, hmm, let's, let me, it's like a second step read, let's say. I have a nation read. Kind of, right? I meet him on an American street. So I know he's probably taking rock too often. Might be totally off for for him maybe he studies game theory and knows that everyone is taking rock too often he sees me things like i'm american or northern european and well he is just taking paper right but population rate will be more often true than not so that would be my my baseline here with taylor and for sure i will take first round if we play one round i will take paper that's it okay let's say play versus pool hmm hat stats let's let's take the rock paper scissor example again what could that be i'm watching taylor now meeting lots of people on the street and playing them this is what the hud is the stats i'm watching him play not necessarily against me but against all the other players maybe he is a super super smart guy and is exploiting all them and he takes paper all the time because he is exploiting but then well he plays me and he knows well he has seen my community coaching and he knows i'm taking paper first so while i see in his hut that he's taking paper most often that will be totally off right because he will actually take scissors against me way more because he has he's playing me differently than the whole pool which i guess again is pretty unlikely it like, it is always a human thing to expect people to think the same way we are. That's like, maybe you have experienced that as well. Once you worked on one specific topic, let's say for me, that is my example is always check-raising from the big blind. I expect everyone else to have the same knowledge because it's so obvious after I worked through that, which is obviously totally off, right? One week before I had no clue maybe. And this is the same thing, right? We are expecting someone to be like, people are scared of exploiting some population tendencies because this might be the one genius who is just the other way around. Well, it's totally fine, right? Because I'm beating the other 95% of suckers. And that is what makes my win rate. And this is the thing. So now we have watched Taylor play all the others. We have his hot stats. And what is more likely? He's the smartest kid in the world and outplays us, or he is just having tendencies and they will be the same against us. But it's very, very important to be aware of where those steps come from. I can give you a poker example as well. So I played Zoom 500. Maybe I've told that story a couple of times already. So maybe you know that. And now coming to the part of how far can we go with our exploit. The stronger our read is, the more we can exploit. Before that, I don't want to go too massively. I play Zoom 500, say 2014, 2015. I have seven do's off on the button. My strategy back then was like a 55% opening range with a min raise to play as many hands as possible and play in position all the time so i have seven deuce off and i see there is a super knit in the big blind now the question is okay i want to open race wider i cannot decrease my sizing even further so that's a little sad but i open race wider and let's say going from 55 to to 100% seemed reasonable, right? Having auto profit against that guy. So yeah, why not? Actually, I like that play with seven deuce off there. And now what happens is the small blind three bets me. Irregular. So fuck, right? What is my answer to that? Now, actually, well, I look at my stats and I had lots of stats on him because I was going for S&E and he was probably doing the same. I don't remember his name, but so we had infinite hands on each other. And actually he had a fold to four bet of 64.2% random number, right? But it was too high. And well, my thought process was easy. Auto profit. If I four bet now, makes totally sense, right? Auto profit, four betting. Hmm. So I went for it. I have my freaking seven news off. I four bet. He calls, but I made my EV, right? He's overflowing. So flop now was ace, eight, three. Obviously ace, high board. Awesome for me. I see that I c-bet my full range on that, if I have a real range. Turn was a five. I pick up a gut shot. What else could I do than just double barrel and attack his pocket jacks? Obvious choice, right? I'm still sitting there with seven deuce off and pretty much 100% of my range that didn't want to flat preflop. And yeah, he calls. River, it breaks off, let's say, a nine. And I'm sitting there with nut low. And if you want to bluff something, nut low should be your first hand, correct? So yeah, I ended up blasting my stacks into his slow play pocket aces with seven deuce off, where I could tell you the story. I mean, I gave you the comment already that this is obviously bullshit what I did, but I could present you the story in another way to at least convince I guess 50% of you that that was a perfectly smart and fine play. Where now we want to take a look deeper because the problem that I had there is actually this here. I had only this read, I only had his HUD, his stats, That's a collection of how he plays versus mainly other players. And maybe he's three betting lighter against them and then folding to four bets because they are value heavy. But well, we know each other. He sees me every day in the pool. And it's like, why should he play the same way against me? Maybe he's just playing a little tighter against me and then tries to not overfold. So what I did was going from 55% open raise to 100%. I still think that is totally fine. And then I went from, let's say, 15% four bet frequency because of a tiny read to 80, 85% four bet frequency, just all the hands I'm not calling. I think that was, that was the massive blow up. And then post-flop being there with like an 85% range and still playing the same way as if I had like top 5% or anything. So yeah, that was a hand that actually took place and is my example for, well, the problem of having that kind of read, right? If it's just a small read, so I can adjust it a little, right? My perfect reasoning would be, okay, I had my exploit with seven deuce off. This guy's actually over-folding to four bets probably. So instead of just taking my king, queen, ace, queen, ace, jack off, like whatever, 30% of the time, let's up that number to 40% and be a little lighter. That would be totally fine and totally enough here. And now coming to next step, play versus hero-like player. This is different, right? It's, let's say, let's go back to rock, paper, scissors. We are again on the streets with Taylor, but today we are not alone. Actually, we send one of our friends ahead. Like we are just watching the whole show from the back. So we sent a good friend who looks a little like us to play Taylor, Rock, Paper, Scissors. And now we are watching how he plays Taylor. And well, Taylor doesn't know that we are watching. I think that's pretty important. And then the next day we meet Taylor and we play him. So that read that we are having, that our friend or brother or whatever told us is obviously worth way, way, way more because it shows pretty much how Taylor perceives us as well. It's pretty much for Taylor, it's playing the same guy. So he takes probably the same strategy. And yeah, so we have a way stronger read. Maybe you have an idea where something like that might have happened in my personal past. And yeah, I'll just tell you another story here. Lots of storytelling today, but I like it. It was 2016. The first time I was playing High Rollers Live. I was in Aria playing, signing up for a 25k. And it was, well, no one knew me. I played with the guys online so i'd reach reach from there and i had hero-like players right i was a random friend of fedor random german but there were lots of random germans playing those so i had for example the information that first black or white spot like something where it's just like i have it or i don't have it it's very very likely that justin bonomo will bluff catch because this is what he does against all new players or did back then what else back then another read was i knew that without playing a single hand life with him before that igor kirganov was like pretty face up on the turn and was insanely overflowing delayed bets, which is great against the pool because everyone is too value heavy there. I tried to structure my range in a way that I'm bluff heavy there. What else? I knew that, well, this is still, this will always be true. Shout out to him that I can call the first spot against Ike or any spot because he will have his bluffs. No worries about that. He will find some. So that's totally cool. If I feel like calling and my hand has some good blockers or anything, I don't need to exploit by overfolding or anything. So I had that strong of a read playing my first 25k because I had five or 10 friends already telling me those. And I could expect that all the villains are playing me pretty much the same way because i'm a random other unknown friend of fedor and yeah then obviously we get to the peak of the pyramid we're like play versus hero this is like the actual thing where villain shows you his strategy this is what we just did before going through the review hands that went to showdown villains are showing you what they play when they play you so those mistakes are really what they i mean they are trying their best against you if this guy with 10 six of diamonds is always playing his flush draws like that i will find out right it's not like something that he will play differently next time probably and the guy flatting queens versus me well he does it against me not against some super whatever kind of thing so this is the strongest thing and this is where we should start and obviously this is still not an answer to the question coming back that was asked because i cannot tell you how far you should go i can only tell you tell you the stronger your reads are the more crazy you can go i definitely know seven dues off four bets with this here if it falls 90 over a sample versus me personally i can go with the seven dues off that's totally fine right just my impression and it shows you at the same time what you should watch out for right to categorize that a little right i have maybe a label like all this top two is what i write down in the notes just like manually writing it down everything else is like this can be a label let's say i see the first limp i attack him as like the might be fish whatever right stack size read i see someone with 73 big blinds and then he limps i'll double confirm probably fish yeah yeah nation read could be something right pretty much close to i've seen someone limping or i see someone that he is from lebanon they are call happy right that's just my experience i don't know anything about about the players from there but my experience is that they are do not like folding right same thing scandinavians are aggressive. There is something about that. And yeah, freaking Germans are usually freaking this. So here we go. Okay, let's keep going. The next question, I guess that was the one from Seberino. The holistic approach of studying poker. And again, we'll end up in me telling stories. So you have the problem of just reviewing hands maybe. So I want to give you the first idea or just approach to that is reviewing hands is a starting point to dive deeper. This is your right. Now, what I did before, I gave you the example, 10-6 of diamond's hand. I can take that to then look, okay, how should the turn check raise strategy look like? But my problem is then the next hand will be about, I don't know, three bad pot out of position. How does my flock check raise look like? And that, and I want to tell you a story to that as well. I don't know whether it was in one of the videos or somewhere else, but a little analogy is how do all the sportsmen, right? do they let's go with football right how do those guys train like of course they review matches i'm sure germany did review the germany versus portugal match even though they won right they have like three four different spots right where maybe maybe it's it's it's yogi loewe or anyone else like telling the players hey they are in the defense that was a little bit of a struggle i'm sure they reviewed the the disaster with the goal versus france like where the the throw in led to like some disorder and that was like messing things up and then the next thing they they go like okay here in the in the offense this is how you need to behave in a different way this is nothing else but us reviewing a session this is exactly the same we take something from there we take something from there we take something from there but this is our starting point and now it's our turn to like we have seen that and we take it into practice we're like hey maybe the focus of your next session should be how to defend those throw-ins against movement a little better right and make some gains around that to just like get that instead of right it's like this this this or imagine a child going to training and the trainer is like let's i'll show you around we'll get better at everything right it's like let's first do shooting right without a warm-up we like that the most so shooting you'll take your right foot the inner side of it and you swing your leg in that way and then the ball flies perfectly that way try it all right that kid tries once and then it's like hand histories i hope you get the point right that then let's move on to the next one now we we had like checking out one sim in the check race game tree and now let's move on to the next one trainer takes the child hey what about passing i think your left foot is weak i'm not sure about that one so you should take your left foot put your right one next to the ball and then take the inner side of the foot to play a very easy pass. All right. Take that wall there, little kid. All right. Let's call him Taylor as well. I like Taylor. So let's do that two times. Right. Let's do it two times. You take the freaking ball, you kick it two times against the wall, and then let's play with with with opponents right now let's let's see like how to tackle someone correctly and this is nothing else what we do with reviewing hands it's yeah we are never really practicing and this is what we need to implement right this is the reviews it gives us confidence when we do something good it gives us topic that we need to work on it is our chance to take notes right so maybe check out the community coaching regarding different ways of reviewing we can learn so much out of that but this is not the end only getting better with reviewing hands you mess up your mind but you are that little child kicking the ball against the wall twice and then going to shooting next and then doing something else. Well, what about headers, right? So this is just very, yeah, a very, very stupid way of studying. If you think like, I want to see poker as a sports in that way. How do we get better at all those different areas? Actually, let's get away from that PowerPoint here and I'll just pull something up that I, well, I prepared, but it's not much. So let's have a look at that. We can make that one bigger. Oh, we've seen that before, right? What would be right? What is the villain doing wrong? What is the right exploit? So many things we can work on. We can work on that stuff in different ways, right? Here, what can we do? Think about what could we do to dive deeper here. Divide and conquer, solve pile spots. What about having a topic like playing a pass with their left foot or check raising the big blind when defending and do that for two weeks straight right you take the review but this is your focus in in every study session well guess what it's like kicking the freaking ball a thousand times against the wall you will nail that you will have that awesome feeling of you are better than everyone else in your games in that specific spot obviously in others you might still struggle and this this is step by step. You can do something like talk to other players. We have a great community. We have players here that play the same things, that make the same experiences, that have the same problems. So looking for your personal Fedor, your personal Reiner, your personal Bb that i worked with it's like i didn't come up with icm strategies my own i let ben cb explain it to me right after he did the in-depth work and then i helped him out with deep stack stuff right and like i was there i remember like how how shy i was before my first live tournaments like like really sitting there very very defensivelyly and like don't give any reads, talk to feet or about and then like just gaining that confidence talking to him like, do you feel anything? Like do you have reads? Is that fine? Or should I behave a little differently to cover something? Like just that constant feedback, totally fine. One other thing that we do not use enough clearly, our brain we can think about it right it's like does that make sense it's a freaking strong tool i remember when i started playing poker i was going to university and i had to take a one-hour train drive one way every day every day that i went to uni actually so not many days, but it's still like that time I had a pen and paper and I thought about poker. So it's like, that can help. Like what could make sense in that spot? Check out my videos, right? Think about it. Take, like give yourself some, some homework, right? Build wardrobes, write down 10 freaking boards and build wardrobes for them. Perfect. And there's obviously many, many, many more. We can, well, watch all kinds of videos. What would be right? We can watch Jared Man or we can watch the backhoe playing and get input. Perfect. What is Willem doing wrong? What can we do? Well, we can do a database analysis our database we can talk to players playing the same game right why not reach out later on and say hey guys i'm playing in a 100 russian cash who else is playing that kind of game what are like perfect i this is one of my biggest benefit that i'm very very close with pretty much anyone in the community and i can just ask anyone and get good answers so this is definitely part of it remember the story of my first 25k i already had players that were playing the same games and this gave me lots of reads this year for example what is villain doing wrong what else could i do i can have a note-taking system for sure right just taking some time think about what can help me actually in the future what do i want to know etc right there's way way way more but did you guys ever sit down like that and try to come up with with a list what you could do i guess most not right so what is the right exploit, we can do some node locking. Next node locking. I made example for that. Just not allow check raising or not allow anything to understand incentives. That could be something. We can, well, use our brain even more. We can talk to other players, use their brains as well. We can again watch the Wacko play. Wacko, Wacko, I'm not sure, Wacko. Watch the Wacko play and see what he does or other great players. So very, very, very, very good ways to learn. And all that is like, hmm, great. And this year is just something that i want to stick to like a longer time frame than just in a little review just watching one hand and then taking a different topic you mess it up for yourself so first thing whenever you are reviewing is sorted by position at least because then you have a couple of spots that are the same right button versus big blind maybe five single race pots in a row and you have you give yourself a chance to understand patterns better hannes how important is confidence at the tail do you sometimes have days where you don't feel confident how much does that impact your play i think it does matter more the less you know about the game like i'm pretty sure i won't mess up even if i'm sitting there not confident like i'm just playing my game and yeah i was nervous and not confident a lot in big terms even though there really wasn't any reason and i think it impacted me heavily yeah if it impacts you in a way that you cannot execute your strategy yeah if you know what is right in most cases then you're at least for me the feeling doesn't matter i will still bluff and i will feel shit while doing that my only thing is like is there a five percent chance that you just see some bluffing and i'm pretty confident that that is not there and yeah could you explain what node locking is that is something that you can do in a solver to just say, usually solver is playing perfect versus perfect. And node locking means in one decision node, you are keeping like, you're just saying what villain does, right? Or you set a framework. It's like, okay, no, he's not playing perfect. He's c-betting full range. And then the solver runs around that side and sees what is best against the range bet. Or I just change the framework from, hey, I node block in a way to say, I don't allow villain at all to check raise to see, well, how much more do I c-bet? Do I use another sizing more often, et cetera? This is pretty much you saying how the strategy looks like to find out what the perfect exploit is. Okay. Could suggest specific drills for saying what would be right with our brain like that you just mentioned of building wardrobes for 10 words. Yeah. I don't know whether that is a question that maybe more drills for that. It's just, I don't have specific drills, but every content video I'm having there, just practice. I don't want to give you homework there because I don't have the time to review that later on, actually. But this is something, hey, why not meet with someone or check this out? It's like someone did. I didn't have a look into it, but I've read the first message. Who's working on a slow low boards and something in depth and has like a file presented. that out we have another great file there where someone is talking about population tendencies and does some analysis right engage there give your opinion and maybe take that and learn from for your side as well so yeah and specific drills i was talking about that there's nothing specific i'm having but it always comes up when reviewing anyways and what i need then is maybe one drill as well as every time every hand you review that went to showdown you can write down something and i like writing down questions because questions are always call to action they force you to do something because you want to find out so yeah just write down the list where you struggle, right? Or the question you're having there, right? It's like one of that that we reviewed, I make it big again, sorry, was villain check raising in 7-7 with 10-6 diamonds turn ace. What is the correct or not correct? Correct not exist there what is the best size here to follow up well this is a job for you right find it out this is well villain betting 50 with 10 10 on10 on king, 8, 3, 6, not 6, 5, 10, something like that, on the river after out-of-position flow. Which sizings to use here best and how to structure, right? Take that, right? Think about stuff like that. I just came up with that without really thinking about it. I asked you those questions. You can ask those questions yourself. How do I play ace-10? Lookalike principle. Something like this can help you. How do I play my pocket tens? How do I play my king-queen, my king-jack? How would I play out of position my pocket nines? Good enough for a block bet or not? No clue. These are questions. Clear solvers. We are the boss. And a solver, or if we don't have that right not every one of us is playing mid or high stakes where we need that that's a heavy investment as well so we can think about that you can think about that as well and come up with your strategy the way i did i didn't tell you what a solver does here i told you here what i think about it it's like okay if i bet big i'm actually attacking king actually but a king bets itself so why should i bet big i can rather protect the rest of my range and then go for the check race something like that this is i guess this is something we can come up with by where is it using our brain right and this be the solver part. The solver is like a stupid assistant. Always gives you an answer that is as complex as the question. So, right? So try to ask easy questions. I think this here is a clear question. I did not ask on that paired board how to play that overall it's like and then giving a gazillion options i won't learn from that right i could start with what's my c-bet strategy given i use one sizing against that what is the better check race strategy i can offer two and see what is better smaller or bigger try to understand always the goal of understanding turn ace okay what is the best size here what what makes sense i can think about that i'm like okay the only things i'm really value betting are 7x and they are trying to get directional in so i should try to get directional and it's like i know it's supernatural to me now but i hope you can see it that by thinking about it we can actually get very close. Having a little assistant is great. But once we do not run the most serious business in the world, it's just we need to do everything ourselves. Just thinking about it while sitting in the train. Thinking about it, well, any time, right? Well, I don't know, while you have your mom on your phone. That's like my times when I think a lot about stuff. So let's leave it as that. Cool. What do you study on your own? I hope I opened some doors there for you. Yeah, that answers the question a little. I could keep going over that for a long time, but that would be too much now. And let's just see what's next. I guess we didn't even talk about the wardrobes yet. So I'll try to speed up a little. All right building your wardrobe and yeah I didn't put that in the video because building a wardrobe was one of the videos where I just was talking to the camera. This is usually the images that I'm using and what you see on the left side is what I call a pile wardrobe. Maybe you remember my little story about wardrobes that I gave you in one of the videos talking about Reiner living out out of a suitcase or just the idea of well someone asks you to do the laundry and then pretty much put all the stuff back in the right order again all right let's say on the left side this is your girlfriend's wardrobe and she asks you to just like wash all the stuff and put bed back there we're like it looks nice right it's like a pio solution it looks perfectly fine but is there any way you can make that right i don't even understand right it's like i look at it and try to understand it okay shoes in there do i know whether it's important that the red shoes are here and the other are on the bottom. I understand okay dresses on the left side here somehow but some other stuff there on the front. Is that important that these are red back there or not? Do I need to focus on that? What about those well the lamps they probably stay but this freaking hand decoration here on the side is it important where it stands exactly? And this is obviously bullshitting around, but the Pio is the same thing. All the mixing, if I offer five different sizings, I will never put it together. And I have no chance to understand what are actually the important points, but is it just important that shoes are in there? Or is it way more about the structure of them themselves and they could be somewhere else as well so super super tough where on the right side you see my little wardrobe from vienna which has two drawers and one big compartment okay i always had this open suitcase for all kinds of stuff on the side that is easy but that actually has a very very easy thing. It's like I think top drawer was just underwear, bottom drawer was sports stuff and top was just everything that is left over. So what you see here is actually you see some like shorts in the top one which is definitely wrong but I think if I give you that structure you will understand it. I don't even to tell you. It's just so obvious that you will maybe put those sports shorts here as well. But you nail that wardrobe 95%, which can then help you poker-wise to play better later. If you didn't mess up so far, it's way easier to do something good next. Okay. So yeah, that's it. So I'm way more focused to that. And I guess next is a question regarding how to simplify and when to simplify. Let's see. So Andreas, I hope you are. Are you here, Andreas? Asks, what's the threshold for when you simplify your wardrobe? So for instance, if a solver checks 90%, then we can probably check range, but other spots might not be so clear cut. Again, I want to start with that by understanding the situation. I only want to simplify when it doesn't cost an EV or when I know I can make up for that EV later on anyways, right? By making life easier for me and maybe tougher for Willem or one of those options. So yeah, let's have a look at those examples that I want to show you, Andreas. We want to understand where EV is coming from. If EV is not coming from a special line, I'm ready to kill that for reasons of simplification. If clear EV is coming from a line, I, well, should definitely consider taking it. Or at least know that I can make up for that in another scenario later. Okay, two examples. I didn't make it super nice. I just did that like three hours ago. So I'll just explain it a little to you. The left side is blind versus blind. Small blind first in, big blind defense. And I only offered a small size on queen, jack, five with a flush draw. So yeah, I can tell you I could put in a big size and it's sometimes taken, but actually not really important. The small size it is here often. And we see a 91% frequency. Now this nails the question pretty much. This is 10% check, 9% check. Should I try to do this or should I try to simplify and just add range? And now what I do is really find out where is EV coming from. And I do that by looking at that, how you call that, card matrix here and try to find out is there a single hand that clearly wants to do one thing. So I'm looking, is there anything that wants to do checking more than 50%? If not, that's all same EV. I don't care, right? Maybe I can get exploited by villain raising a little lighter, but that's small bullshit. So what I found, the lowest frequency CBET is A7 off. So I clicked on that. You can see the individual combos here on the right side. And actually it still says small bet is actually higher EV. Well, if I keep the solver running, that will be evened out in the end end that can mean on the one side that the frequency will still go up on the other we can just see it as like it doesn't matter so i have the very clear answer here fuck it right it's like the very clear answer we don't need that bullshit checking line because it's not giving us additional ev what what is that checking around? Like you could have guessed like pocket tents, but it's actually not, right? It's like they are all fine betting. So why not doing it? I know exactly, my flop play is done. I don't need to think about that anymore. And I know exactly what my turn range is. It is my freaking full range, right? So that is pretty easy. And on the right side, now going one step further, the A-Skin 4 board, I guess that was actually easy and on the right side now going one step further the ace king four board i guess that was actually in one of the videos where i talked about we can play that board with a big bet and check what the solver suggests or take other reasons to use the small bet let's just assume we decided i'm sorry this is button versus big blind ace king four i'm four. I'm a little too fast, I guess. Button versus big blind, ace, king, four. We open race, big blind defense. And here I just said I use the small bet, even though I know the big bet makes lots of EV. This is just for example reasons now. And because I have the nice outcome that we bet like 82%, something like that, with that small sizing. And I do again the same thing to understand where is EV coming from. If I want to use a check back, what are the important hands that clearly prefer doing that? So now again, screening the card matrix here, looking for hands that want to do checking more often than 50 percent what do we find pocket queens quite obvious pocket jacks okay and queen suited probably some of the queen nine off combos as well that's it but everything else is mixed around that pocket aces are indifferent in a way. Small aces are indifferent. The king X, checking fine, betting fine, whatever, right? The one that clearly prefers the check is queen nine of spades, queen nine of hearts, right? You even see like a six cent EV difference in a $28 pot. So yeah, now the question is, this is something for us to decide. we giving that up that ev to play a more simple strategy or not and that's totally fine right both answers are totally correct i want you to understand right like okay why is queen nine the burst hand obviously well it gets called by all queen jack and all queen ten we fold out all queen jack, nine, all 10, nine. That does not really make sense in the first place. But just betting that board is totally fine. So if villains are not check-raising enough of their three, five suited, that hand will perform quite nicely, actually. So, right, it's like, this is something, I can see range betting that board as well. Totally fine in my eyes. But I want to understand first, where is it important? Where does EV come from, et cetera? I hope that, I mean, it's again, there's no perfect answer to that question, but it should help a little. Okay. Hey, Mukesh, great that you made it right here. I've seen you joining today. So shout out to Mumbai. The question is how many subsets of flops will be ideal to study the specific spots, button versus big blind, single spot. Again, here, there is no answer. This sounds to me like some kind of learning by heart strategy, right? I know 20 boards here, 20 boards there, 20 boards there in those spots. And that means I pretty much know everything, but I want to use looking at those boards to understand the concepts behind it. So this board here for me is good enough to say, hey, this is for all boards where I have top two pair and villain does not have those in the top sets. Ace-queen-four, ace-queen-six, ace-queen-deuce will be the but Norse is big blind. Middle position, Ace-King-3 will be the same. Then, well, maybe I'll look a little at boards, let's say, paired boards, for example. What about 10-10-X from under the gun? Well, that's great, because I have lots of offsuit 10s still. 9-9-X from under the gun would be a totally different thing. So I want to understand those patterns. So there's no answer. Learn those 20 words for every spot. It's like, how is the spot different? What is interesting for those ranges? And have some examples, right? Just probably starting with five different ones first is pretty cool already. Yes. Canopy, your question is just a very clear yes. When working with a solver, would you suggest for the people that aren't really doing the solver work yet, trying to understand the reasons with only a few sizings to begin with? Yes. Small. I said before, a solver is your assistant. It gives you answers that are as complex as your question. So if you ask easy questions, you get easy answers. That makes it way easier to learn from. But if you, let's say we make two simulations and one is with a small size, one is with a big size. And we see, hey, the big size is way cooler. This is what we wanted to find out. Perfect, right? Or we do something, whatever, like just, yeah, I don't know. i could give millions of examples now but this is just it the easier your question the easier the answer the solver gives you and that can help you understand stuff better okay yeah that's it regarding the building the wardrobe that it was a little easy here now because it was just one question regarding that but i guess most of you just idea, right? We don't want to look at the hand and then decide what we do before we want to cut down our options to make our life easy. If I know already that I'm just range betting, I don't need to look at my hand anymore. And this prevents us from one of the biggest leaks out there, which is sizing or action triggered by hand. People look at their hand and then they do what their hands like to do, which is just like often just like not fitting in the range. It's just, yeah, they bet big on, I don't know, a board where they should never bet big and they do it because they just have it right now. Something like that. What would make the range on the left a pure strat? Is there a range versus range equity threshold where Pio starts using a mixed strat versus a pure strat? This is very freaking terms. What is a pure strat for you? Is a pure strat just a range bet, if you mean that? There's not an equity threshold. Yeah. I guess this year actually goes up a little more if I keep the solver running because we see that right now A7 off has still higher EV and betting. What the solver does is then just, he doesn't know anything about hands and boards. He just sees, oh, betting is better. That means the next round, the solver runs it through. He will just increase the frequency there and see how everything adjusts, how the EVs change until there is some kind of equilibrium. So if I keep that running, I guess we get to 93, 94, 95, maybe even higher percent, given that outcome I see here right now. And there is no equity threshold because it's a whole combination of things. it's something like the pure raw equity is definitely a part but I can give you an example a toy game where the guy with 66% equity will bet 0%. Because it's way more about not equity as well. Who has the best hands? The deeper we are, it's more about that. Not equity right now and not equity over time. So here we have something that we pretty much look in the future. We have an advantage right now. The advantage will stay over time. It might even get bigger. Let's say there's a 10 on the turn, right? It's just the small blind who has ace king. Maybe it's a king. Both players have ace 10, but the small blind has kings as well. And all that king queen more often. Ace king will add more of that stuff turn is a deuce right so maybe after calling the big blind will not have two pairs and sets anymore so the deuce is a full brick which increases the value of like the future game of the small one lots that's a big big big mix so we cannot break that down to something super simple okay let me continue with the ask me anything to just get through those questions because it's already 90 minutes over. I just make it a little quicker and feel free to go in the Slack afterwards, discuss right first with your classmates. I will have a look over it the next days and I will give my input. It's not, we make sure to, to work together on that. Obviously I will give all, not always, but I will often give my input as well, but it's not meant as like, okay, we use that. And this is your tool to reach out to me. And we have like 50 private coachings at the same time. So it's really, you can discuss, right. And I want to give you the framework, what makes sense and which way to work. And then hopefully one year from now, we have, we've seen some, some, some some crushers here in in the crew so yeah let's just quickly go through that here you do it better your question so for every non-german that means patience please that name so i like it a lot we're only digging deeper into your yeah you were only digging deeper into your red line problem when you asked me the first long questions that did not really fit for this session here and you came up with lots of spots where we are in position single raise pot and the action goes bet check check and improving some of those spots rather to bet check bet more would be cool i guess but since villains out of position are probably not block betting thinly enough so we see right it's like something what would be right you put in some population tendency they probably not block betting thinly enough. So we see, right? It's like something what would be right. You put in some population tendency. They are not block betting thinly enough for value. The EV of your river bet decreases. Is that correct? Right? I won't make a quiz out of that now to save time, but the clear answer is no. The EV of your river bluff decreases, right? But you can bet thinner for value. They are missing out on value. That means they are sitting on way, way more third pairs, second pairs they should. So what can you do to attack a range like that? You can bet bigger for value and you can bet thinner for value. It's not necessary. If people are not folding, forget about the bluffs. The exploit is to go thinner for value and bigger for value. This can increase your red line as well. Every hand that you do not check back and you bet, well, if villain calls, you have a better blue line. Even if he folds, well, you win the same amount, but it goes into the red line. So this is maybe something where maybe the king six example before for you was good. Just like to make sure to not forget that against the block bed we raise, if, well, maybe if he checks and they have that hand category more often, it would be cool to not go with 75%, but just size up to pot, saying they always have that one hand category. So yeah, I would always focus. I mean, I don't want to say I don't want to have bluffs in those spots because it's often wrong, right? A bluff to be winning there, given the size, usually needs only like 30 to 50% fold equity. It does not have to work all the time. So it's great to know like some snap folds that are there, right? And we can focus on them, unblocking them. And then we know if we need 30% fold equity and we know the first 20 are his snap folds, how bad can it be? So this would be it. Thank you. on them, unblocking them, and then we know, right, if we need 30% fold equity and we know the first 20 are his snap folds, how bad can it be? So this would be it. Let me just get to the next one. I think this is what I answered with a pyramid of reads a little already. Flipside300, I'm really struggling with labeling villains quickly. How to identify, label people over-aggressive, tight, aggressive, ragfish. I constantly hear people say the player in the one seat is this and this totally right i hate that how much people say that because they often just have no clue try to collect those clear reads and be aware of what your read is and then make assumptions there how do we gather this information without huts so there was a long thread i made in the cash game content one or in a hand analysis. I don't remember about like what to start a hut with. And actually this answer is the same thing here, even without a hut. We focus on showdowns, things we see. Do we see him open raising king six off from the button? We know he is to lose. Boom. That's it, right? We can write it down. That player will probably be to lose from middle position as well yeah this is the one thing right just like the very easy things that we can see opening ranges three bad ranges someone three betting pocket sixes button versus cutoff is probably a little light we've seen the example where someone is flatting middle position versus early position but if i see something like fives there well I know something that is but if i see nines okay i probably nail it right that i he has what i'm expecting and on the other side having some kind of image that is created even without showdowns that's very very variance heavy short term but it's like is this guy giving you trouble a lot? It's like, is he raising small block bets ever? Some people are not. Is he just like passive and then folding or what? This is just an impression that you get while observing the table. Often, it's even great. I like the GG replay a lot to watch how they play versus other players. Every showdown is freaking valuable. So focus on those. Yeah, I can't adjust my range if I can't identify easily a villain's playing style. A hundred percent, right? We need to spot villains' mistakes and then take the best out of us by writing our notes. Okay, so how do you go about labeling, starting with them arranged to your villains at the table, especially life? Yeah, life is even tougher because of the low sample. But I try to talk to friends who played them already so this is a big plus and if not focus on showdowns even when you're not in the hand every showdown that you see you should have at least one note coming out pretty much live because there you don't have hotkeys or anything so so every sizing could tell you something just write it down make your mind up later what that. Something like that. You have plenty of time on the live table to do that kind of stuff instead of looking at your phone or watch like Netflix on your iPad on the side. Okay, and the third question, I guess I answered that slightly already from Tom now. Very nice structure of the question. I struggle myself structuring my posts in Slack, but this looks great. And he asks, I watch good players who put out free content, but it seems they don't always agree, but I assume are all winning. First of all, that is wrong. So not everyone who's doing content is winning, but yeah. I sometimes develop multiple personality disorder when trying to apply what I see these players doing. For example, I see some players, Jaredman, BannerBadBeat, shout out to them, very great players, that seems to try to focus on being as close to theory as possible, or so it sounds. Seems like a good place to start. So we have to put that into some context here as well. First of all, who are those players? They are really playing the game. They try to to make money with the game what they show you is not necessarily everything they are actually applying right it's like i know i have spots where i'm heavily overfolding but i have the feeling in stream i cannot do it because it's just like too much of an exploit and just like telling everyone this this knit always has it so this is why lots of those this type of content producers they do those because this is part of their studying as well and they focus on that because it's just their baseline why should they don't need to deviate they don't need to tell everyone they are playing against what their reads are so focusing on that is pretty great their thought process if you listen to jared man on those youtube videos awesome thought? Really nailing it down. That doesn't mean that he is never exploiting, right? Maybe it seems like that in the videos. I didn't watch all of them, so I'm not really sure. I just had a quick look at them. But yeah, this is something you can learn. This can be part of your how to study poker part one. What would be right? Look at that. What is his framework? which wardrobes does he build on certain boards write it down right it's like king seven deuce range bet 25 maybe he even says it right three bet pot out of position 10-5 deuce does he use 75 50 or even goes with a small bet does he explain the reason perfect input he can take lots of solver work away or or help you right when you don't use a solver or anything right it's just perfect i see some players the wacko that seem to take very uncommon sizes and lines but maybe just a more complex strategy right it's called the wacko show i'm not sure he enjoys the game he likes to put puzzles out there but i can tell you we are very very thinking alike regarding that i was always a multi-tabler so i was heavily into simplification he never was a big multi-tabler i guess so he's really looking at the spot and like trying to put out puzzles there to not exploit people to the maximum but play a very very complex pile wardrobe or something that makes sense don't want to say pile wardrobe so this is still something to learn from oh what is his thought process there could it work in in your world as well we started the session today with there are lots of correct answers there is not really a there is a wrong but not really right so far we can solve part situations and we have ideas Thank you. session today with there are lots of correct answers there is not really a there is a wrong but not really right so far we can solve part situations and we have ideas but it's not like that if someone else is doing something a little bit different it's not wrong right take my ace king for example from the content videos sometimes i'm using wardrobe number one sometimes i'm using wardrobe number two both of them are totally wardrobe number two. Both of them are totally valid, in my opinion. I think Jinj Pokeru seems to focus on very different aspects than others. I cannot comment too much on that because he comes over as kind of a field player. He definitely knows his basics, but I've seen like ridiculous faults because he just feels it. We're like, I was sharing hand histories with other recs. I'm not sharing hand histories but they they wrote me in in sky like look what happened here and what he said in stream we're like i don't know he i have some hands in mind where he just folds something ridiculous versus a bluff because well if i need if i'm like with things like that that are just untrue we're like if i call here i need to call down the river as if you put it in other terms and he's saying, yeah, people who are bluffing here are always going for the river and this is why I make my over-fold decision here. This is often the context that is missing because he comes over as like enjoying the game and fun and is not talking deeply about strategy. So actually that might be some exploits that he is not necessarily talking that in depth about. And obviously there's something to learn from as well. Write it down. What is his wardrobe in those spots? What is he doing there? Is he talking about his assumptions? Verify those assumptions for your games. Make your own mind up. Okay. Is it even worth looking at them from a strategy point of view or leave it to just entertainment? It's definitely worth it. This is part of your what could be right. What are people doing wrong? You can learn from all that. This is all great stuff out there. And yeah, it's not, you should never have the goal of I copy him and then I win. It's like, no, this is not, you can learn from it. Take the best out of it and build your stuff, right? It's your game that you're playing, your level that you are on. It's like your specific villains you're playing against. I'm sure, like if you just do what I do when I play higher stakes and stream it maybe, and you do it on NL10, maybe it's not really winning. It might be the case, right? And yeah, because, well, if I would play on NL10, I would play totally differently. Not only when it's the goose hunt, but yeah. Okay, let's wrap it up here. I guess that was the last one. Yeah, with lots of talking, lots of stories. Great that you all have been here. And I guess, yeah, let's keep going. I will probably next video coming out next week. It was a blast again. See you guys in Slack. I think I gave you plenty of reasons to start Threats talk about stuff together i will have a look yeah enjoy the process and see you next time
