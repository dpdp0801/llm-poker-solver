### TOPIC: cash hand review 1
 Great to have you here. Just right now, I have that two things on the screen that you should see. A little presentation where I'll show some hands and the Kahoot, I will switch to one or another once we really get started. Guys, today I have a little prize. So I did negotiate with Hannes to have a little festival t-shirt for the Kahoot winner because today we have some fun, not fun questions, but we'll have a look at the hands and we'll try to figure out whether those high stakes guys played right or not. And it's your job to find that out. I'll start with the first hand actually, because that is not part of the quiz. This is just the, maybe with that one, I will, I want to explain how we go through that. So I took 11 hands total. We'll have the first hand here and how we will work our way through those is you see, I just copy pasted that out of the two plus two thread is we want to do a couple of things. We want to first think about how did they play it? And by doing that, we want to think about, Hey, how would we play that hand ourselves? So every single time, don't worry about reading that right now you don't need it so far every single hand i will guide you through the hand i will pretty much play the role of one of the players that is interesting in that hand and guide you through one time like on the one side the decisions that i in that case had to make and the decisions I'm facing. And we think about, oh, this is freaking loud. I could kill those people. And yeah, you see how distracted I am once there is some freaking noise. But yeah, we will try to think about what kind of wardrobe I built there. Should I bet with my hand? Which kind of sizings do I want to use to then figure out, hey, does that make sense? So most of the hands I already ran in the solver and we can look that up. I have them and we will see maybe some, I don't know, mistakes maybe of those high stakes players, maybe some, let's call them exploits, right? Some clear deviations from a more or less optimal strategy and it's our job to find them out so every question will be the same in the kahoot quiz and it will be who did mess up i only chose heads up hands so you always have two players the potential answers that will be on there is both. No one were the two names of them. And then we can even discuss in the chat, which street they messed up, whatever, which sizing, which I don't know. And then we can look it up in the solver and pretty much guide through that ourselves. And the goal is to, well, have a little fun for sure, but to learn as well. Like what is a mistake? What is actually okay? What did they do? Which we maybe did not think think of but we learned that this is a cool thing someone's saying this one is three-handed well it's always heads up on the flop so here it's heads up on the flop let's let's start with that one i will take the spot of stefan here and what happens is a bit too easy open raises on the button, I decide to flat king 10 suited. We see that hand here, which is as a standard, a three bet. But we have someone behind who is a very unknown. I have never heard that name. And by seeing the showdown already, we can guess that he is more of a recreational player. So Stefan did decide to take a three bet into his flatting range, probably because of the person behind. So that would be a first learning thing that we can maybe think about it. So what happens next? The recreational player squeezes, the button folds and it's back to us. King-10 suited, pretty clear call in that spot. Flop, we check obviously on Jack-10-5, face a third pot c-bet. We call with our mid-peer. Turn is a brick. We check. We face another third pot bet, which I would say does not make too much sense, and we decide to call again. We might be behind. We might be ahead. Who knows? We have a mid-peer. We have, I don't know how good the king is, whether that plays a role, but we have a pretty good price. We river the freaking trips. The flush gets there. And now we decide to donk jam all in 1.7 times pot or something like that against the recreational. And I guess that's the first step that is pretty important to understand that this is just the golden move here to just get the money in against the recreational when you have it in the end against a probably strong range, a squeezing and then betting twice, where while in that spot, it actually makes sense from a theoretical standpoint as well, because in position shouldn't have any 10X after betting twice, but it's just pretty freaking important to collect those little $10,700. Yeah, this is how we will go through the hands. This is obviously against the recreational. So looking it up in some kind of solver doesn't make too much sense in my eyes. So I did not run that one. And yeah, but you see, we have some kind of deviations already pre-flop taking place here. And I think Stefan played that hand pretty much perfectly. And now let's start the next one. I'll guide you through the hand first and then I'll start the Kahoot. So your goal already is to think about who messes up. No one, both of them or which one of the players. And let's go. This time we start three handed. This is a clear rack war. All of them are playing those limits regularly. Stefan decides to 2.15x on the button, so chooses a smaller open size. And Oshpil defends. And okay, I didn't show the hands. I mean, I wanted to show. Do we see the hands? No, that's on the bottom. I can tell you the hand stefan has pocket aces and oshbiel has 10-6 offsuit so first thing we are seeing here in most of the hands like players are open raising like 2.5x or something like that and stefan chooses a smaller sizing on the button so we could think about why is he doing that oshbiel therefore needs to extend his defending range in something like 10-6 off. I guess it's very close, but is a defense sometimes. And now what we see the first thing is King 10-6 with a flush draw and think about how would you build your wardrobe? You are the open raiser on the button. Which sizings do you use? Probably it's something like a 25,30% sizing, maybe a bigger sizing as well, like something like 75%, 80%, I don't know. Stefan chose 150% pot. Ospiel decides to call his bottom two pair, turn is a brick, Stefan goes for another 150% pot, and Ospiel jams the whole show. So now this is the very first hand and I'll start the Kahoot now. We got 26 of you in there. Good luck, everyone. I think like this is fine. So you remember parts of the hand, but you see the Kahoot as well. So I guess that should work out. And yeah, let's see. Who do you guys of those guys messed up? Nobody, both of them. Did Stefan mess up at some point? Did Ospiel mess up at some point? Messing up really being defined as doing something clearly wrong if we look it up in the solver. That's what I consider a mess up. If it's like close or mix, that's all fine. So it's a little sad that it shows the right answer right away. You said both of them messed up. Okay. So what is really interesting is, I guess it's all about that 150% on the flop, right? So I ran that sim here. I don't know how familiar every one of you is with the Pyosolver. I use that because I can implement like my sizings there. Odin would be super great to compare as well. but here I really wanted to use the sizings that the players are using. So I decided on like a wider defending range to make sure 10-6 off is in there. That is a little on me, what my input is there, but now we want to check. So I force Ospiel to range check, which I guess is pretty standard. And now we have multiple options of bet sizings. I offered 25%, I offered 75%, and I offered the 150%, which actually is taken quite often, right? So it's the first thing when learning something here is, hey, I'm personally not using it. I use a simplification here and only use two sizings, one big one and one small one, because I need those two and don't want to have that further split. But it's still interesting to find out which are the hands that are interested in betting big here. It's like pocket sixes, pocket aces, king 10. and how can we think about those hands if you want to describe them a little i would say hey those are those hands that are pretty nutted right now but won't stay nuts over time so they really have the incentive to get the maximum money in right now so we figure out okay aces is actually quite a nice combo to go for the very big bet. And now maybe some more input on the exploitative side. Oshpil is known to be one of the most passive players on high stakes. His check raise frequency is like insanely low. He's like trapping all the time and not bluffing enough starting at that point, which, well, makes it way more interesting to take control over the pot size yourself. And I guess it's a great exploit of Ospil really using that size here, which makes sense in a theoretical way. And then from an exploitative standpoint against passive players who do not check raise any king-axe or something like that ever, where enough of of the weak draws well you want to charge that those a little more before there's the nine of states on the turn so the overbet 10-6 is a mix we can check raise that now we can call it now so all fine by by oshpil and the turn was the five of clubs again the check is standard aces can keep going with the overbet can use a normal 75 percent size that's all good stefan goes for the overbet again and ospil decides to jam now interesting to see that the one with a six of spades is just calling the one without should prefer the jam a little but whatever right so that as playing correctly. He had the one without spades, so all good. And now interesting is, I guess the most crucial point is actually this one, that this clear value bet on the turn against the check jam can be a solid fold. I didn't have all the time in the world for that big game tree to run in the solver. So you see that it still even says like like minus 85 dollars here but just seeing that the solver mixes between call and fold shows us well that will be indifferent in the end if i keep the solver running forever it will be indifferent in the end so call is fine fold is fine but actually overbet folding there your aces seems like a cool thing to be doing as well so yeah that was the very first hand and on the next ones we will definitely see the hands first i'm sure let's see who who were the two lucky people or smart people who got it right andres and mihua so perfect and now we got i guess is it eight nine questions total so plenty of room to catch up there and yeah if there are any questions regarding that, I try to talk as much as possible about the hands to really give you the idea of, okay, which wardrobe makes sense? What were those guys doing here? What were they potentially thinking about? We will see some clear mistakes as well. So don't worry. But if there are any questions, feel free to ask. It will feel a little like a rush to really get through those 10 hands. Let's keep going. Hand number two. So now I will guide you through again. I like to take Stefan's position because he usually doesn't mess up. One of the best players, in my opinion. He decides to take his small open race size again on the button. Tax here is Kevin Pak or Kevin Paké. I'm not sure. Dutch or Belgian. I guess Dutch player, three bets from the small blind, and Stefan decides to four bet. Stefan has ace-10 off, so that's pretty standard, some kind of frequency four bet, and Taxier decides to trap his aces, which in those positions is pretty much a standard play with high frequency as well. what we see now on the flop is interesting. We flopped ace, jack, four, and Stefan, or let's say I decide in position to go for 10% cbet. All right, so far so good. Tex here calls his top set, turn is a nine, and it goes check, check. River is a five, and Tex here decides to bet 30 of the pot now and i think all right guys that's good enough for me ace 10 does the job let's freaking jam that shit and get stacks in yeah i i hope i i think that's a fun hand let's see let's get to the to the Kahoot. And yeah, make up your mind who did mess up here. Taxier, Stefan, both or no one? While I try to load that in pile already. All right, I've got you again. So Stefan did mess up in your eyes and only two people decided that tags here messed up. So now, just now that you know that I have a pretty strong opinion here, maybe try to think about where did he mess up? Just write it in the chat. This is not part of the quiz. And yeah, so I cannot read the full name here maybe i can make bigger donk on the turn i don't think so because of the missed draws he bets aces he should check it on the river probably just calling the tiny sea vencer check raise flop bet large all right so you see this is the fun part how many things with the freaking super nuts they are still left to think about so let's have a look ace jack four first of all let's double check the ranges in position ace 10 off quite a high frequency for that out of position trapping aces pretty often while never trapping kings for example and well what what do we see first, no one was after the 10% seabed, right? And what we see is actually this is if I offer 10%, I offer 25 and I offer half pot. What we see is that in position should actually always use the 10% here. Yeah. So that's the first interesting thing. I guess everyone is seabedding quarter pot here or whatever, because that's the's the small size, but in some instances actually like even going smaller can be pretty cool. So ace-10, 10% nailing it. First thing, everyone who said we should check-raise the aces here was wrong, right? Aces have the freaking super nuts. We want villain to catch up to something that is like a second best hand. What we want to check- like ace jack that's more vulnerable ace queen that's more vulnerable so yeah pocket jacks unblocking the ace that that's a good check raise as well adding something like a two outer plus backdoor flush draw where that pocket fives here having the backdoor straight draw as well can be a cool bluff here that still has some equity so you see like lots of stuff we can look at that's a 0.01 we won't discuss that because that's the solver thing and yeah that that will disappear if we keep it running so no more jokes allowed about that we have the clear call we see the nine was it the nine of diamonds i guess nine of diamonds on the on the turn. And we clearly see no donking. So next step is, yes, ace-10 could check back, could bet small again. So this is totally okay. Stefan decided to check back. Ace-king check back would not be okay. So yeah, that's totally fine. And now the river was the five of clubs. And now it's the interesting point. I mean, so far,'t mess up it has to come now so that's the only option and what do we see here that 30 sizing does not freaking exist because it just doesn't make sense what's the main part of buttons range it's like kings it's queens it's jack x so is there any hand you want to bet small to to target i don't know it doesn't make sense right you in position has mainly medium strong hands we only can target them with a bigger sizing and now maybe think about well it's either dice or lookalike principle like every ace should be good enough to bet here right villain should be back keep betting on the turn with every ace king with every ace queen with ace jack it's like checking back ace 10 and then he has king jack offsuit pocket kings pocket queen so every ace eight a seven is good for a big bet and pocket aces you want to put in the same range definitely checking is way better than betting betting small. If we look at the EV here, you see the numbers. Betting, block betting just does not make any freaking sense. So we want to put our aces in the same range like our ace eight suited, like our ace 10 suited. That makes sense. Why doesn't Stefan call the river here? Well, I thought about making a mistake from Stefan as well, but I don't think so because tax year is using a small bet site that doesn't exist. So it's really that. And Stefan now has, like Stefan knows that that sizing doesn't make sense. And therefore it's his job to evaluate which part, which hands could that be? And maybe he goes for like, it can be a weaker ace. Maybe it's something like trying to get some small value out of something like King-Jack that doesn't make sense. Who knows? So I don't blame him for that race. I could make it a mistake as well, but I don't see it as that against the block bet. It's just villain can never have a better hand. Ace-Queen is a clear race, very clear race. Ace-King is a very clear a very clear race ace 10 is still okay to race given the solver output here so it's just villain chooses a zero percenter and then it's you can feel free whatever you you want to do as long as it still somehow makes sense and i think ace 10 he should never be beat if if villain is like somewhat competent so yeah i like stefan's race here It's a race pretty much no one is doing, but if Taxier shows up with ace-eight suited, he looks like the biggest genius. And I guess it's more likely that we see some kind of ace-eight, ace-seven suited than pocket ace. All right. Very, very fun hand. That's small to induce. Yes. Yeah. But the thing is, did he win something? It's like, okay, if he jams, well, every ace is a call pretty much. If he bets big, yeah, okay, ace-ten is just a call. But even against the big bet on the river, ace-ten is okay to still jam against that. But yeah, it's a fun hand. Okay, next one. This time we have a three-bet pot. Kaihan Mok is a regular. I think he moved up in the last year. I played mainly 1k and 2k. I played lots with is i guess he's from norway and quite an aggressive player he open raises he uses a bigger sizing than stefan on the button and stefan uses like more or less a standard 12 bb 3 bet from the big blind kaihan mock decides to call with his 5-6 suited and actually fun to see here is that stefan uses a hand like ace 9 offsuit we'll double check that whether that makes sense and then we get a flop of nine six four with a flush draw so now the first thing to think about is how does your wardrobe look like do you see that small do you see that big or check do you use two sizings in a checking range do you only use one of the sizings in a checking range? Do you check range? What are you doing? All right. So ace nine, Stefan decides to bet big here. And well, five, six obviously calls. Turn three, pretty much a brick. Stefan decides to check now. And we see a check back. River is a seven. Every five makes a straight. Stefan checks. And the Norwegian jams like 100, what is it 40 pot something like that and stefan calls so i hope the hand history is clear big blend versus button three bad pot stefan goes for the big c bet turn check check river check face a large gem call off your ace nine here and now i'm interested in your answers so no one with two correct answers so far and let's let's see we'll get the first one now who messed up all right finally we got them okay so both of them messed up is my conclusion here and we'll find out why. So five, five lucky winners this time, everyone rooting against Stefan this time. So let's, let's have a look. 964. First of all, this is pretty much the three bed range that the solver tells me against a 2.5 X opening range, which was pretty much the sizing he used. So like those offsuit aces sometimes make it in there. 12%. I'm sure Stefan is just playing something like that and is not going crazy with those. So totally fine. And yeah, in position, obviously 5-6 suited, always a call, sometimes maybe a 4-bet, maybe sometimes even a fold, who knows. And yeah, now let's see the flop, 9-6-4. I gave the option of like the sizing he used a smaller sizing or a check so what the problem with that board is that big blind has not advantage right now jacks tens queens kings aces are just freaking good but he will lose it over time right the position is just very strong here every eight every seven every five flush card, just like kills the spot a little for out of position. So what the goal is here for the big blind is not necessarily to bet big, but to get as much money in with those hand categories as possible. This can be a check raise or a bet, right? If you look, maybe aces are a little special because, well, they want to keep some hands in. But let's say we check, build in steps, and then you see that like kings and queens and jacks are just 100% of check raise. Even aces are 50% of check raise. So this is something to keep in mind. Well, those hands are just having the goal to get the money in now. We can achieve that by betting big or by check raising. That's small assist maybe for other hands like pocket nines, okay, 10-9, jack-9, some other stuff. And let's have a look at ace-9. It's pretty much the same hand category like pocket tens. So it's blocking the 9x, which sucks a little. With tens, we like to get it in against king-9. With ace-9, well, people are having that a little less. But that's the same thing. It's either betting big or it's check-raising mainly. So I like Stefan's big bet a lot here. And there's nothing to talk about the 5-6 suited call. Against the big bet, it doesn't make sense really to raise. All right. So I need to look up the turn card again. Three of diamonds. And now diamonds and we want to look at stefan's exact hand he has ace nine ace of spades nine of diamonds and let's have a look here ace of spades nine of diamonds always wants to overbet jam and there are two reasons right there is nothing good happening for the ace nine here like no card is is really nice to see we are unblocking hearts so when we use that overbet jam we are target like we are making flush draws puke so that's that's one good thing and now you see like the ones with a heart they'd like checking especially, well, the ones with a spade are the worst to go into like the checking mode because, well, villain is floating spades on the flop and he would bluff them now. But actually we are blocking them. So spades is really the last one you want to check here. I see where that is coming from. That like, okay, we checked like those ace highs, those ace queens. It's kind of a lookalike principle. But I made that a mistake because just the jam is, it feels like clearly being the better play. And now let's double check after the check. What we see as well as, okay, only a small size used by Kaihan Mok and five, six suited of diamonds here. And you can look at the V is just 100% that here, right? It's just, you're not improving when villain is improving himself. You just have the equity now and you want to fold out something like king 10 of clubs, like queen jack of clubs. You want to get value, like let villain check jam his a7 or whatever. Yeah yeah it's just you want to bet that and not realize so an equity that he definitely has against your hand while well does it help you to keep something in and then river your straight in the end well is villain improving to some kind of second best hand on a deuce or a seven not really right so this is like the clear mistake more more or less here it's we're we're talking about very high stakes so it's like if this is played on nl 100 i don't call it a mistake but here we have to be a little more strict so he did decide to check back river is the seven of diamonds again that ace nine that stefan has is a hundred percent bet here which just like convinced me to make sure it's a mistake. Finally, finding a Stefan mistake is strong. So yeah, the ace of hearts is the one he's always checking. The other ones are just a clear value bet. And he decided to check though. Villain obviously jams now his trade. That's a great move. And ace nine is just a fist pump, not a fist pump pump but it's like a call that you have to make so it's just about the turn play about the river not not value betting and for i guess i could make an argument for for the norwegian playing that hand correctly but i think the the turn that is just too clear to get him away with it all right let me actually load the next hand on the side already because we will still have Stefan involved. So more Stefan fun coming up here and get ready. We have another three bet pot. Actually, this more or less same spot we have. Oh, I think I solved that incorrectly. Damn it. I think I solved that for button versus big blind again, but okay. Won't actually change too much in that spot. Yeah. I, yeah, maybe a little, just maybe pretend that this is button versus big blind. What happens? Stefan raises and Immunist star another. Yeah. I think we talked, we had him before, right? A Russian high stakes rec. Three bets. You see, he is three betting a little smaller than Stefan is with his 600. Maybe he's adjusting to Stefan's smaller open raise size or whatever. We get a flop that is 6-5-4 with a flush draw. And Munis star decides to check. And Stefan takes his freaking set and checks back. Interesting, first of all. I guess most of you won't do that because we have a freaking set turn is the five of hearts so flush is possible and yeah munistar having aces with a flush suit is now block betting and stefan goes for like a normal sized race that's like two-thirds pot race munistar calling and then on a fourth heart on the river decides to donk third pot. Stefan takes his boat, obviously moves in and Munir decides to call it off with a nut flush. So yeah, very interesting hand, right? We see a check check from the aggressor, checking back a set, checking aces. We see a block bet on that five. We see a race with a full house and then we see a donk on the four flush on the river and stefan well i guess that's the obvious move to jam your your full house there let's see interested in your answers here let's see still no one with two correct answers so everyone's still in contention for the festival t-shirt who messed up this one? Okay, so you guys are giving shit to Munir Star. I decided that this is a nobody, but I told you already, I solved it for Button versus Big Blind. I think it doesn't change too much with those hands here. But yeah, so just to keep that in mind when looking at the sim. Do you have Odin to look at the hand? I did not use it here because Odin has preset sizings and Pio allowed me, I had the time to run it myself, right? Odin is the shortcut for your own sessions to look things up very, very fast. I used this morning to run stuff myself to make sure I use the exact sizings that people were using in that hand to not like make adjustments. Like it's obviously a small difference, whether it's 25 or 30 or 40%, but I just want to make sure that I use the ones. So this is why I'm not using Odin here, but for yourself on a big, big plus on Odin, just like to for session reviewing, that's even faster. Right? So I had the time to prepare that for you, but it took me some time. Okay, let's have a look at that 6-5-4. Let's think about all the situations. So again, now let's just pretend it's big blind versus button. And then 6-5-4 with a flush draw is just freaking nuts for imposition, right? So actually the aggressor, and you have to see we were 160 big blind steep here and that that outcome just means imposition has the clear nut advantage aces kings queens are not nuts anymore here it's five six suited four five suited seven eight suited four is five sixes which big blind never has so it's like this is imp position is the freaking boss so we arrange checking pretty much out of position and in position attacks that with a small bet and what we see here is well good mix of all kinds of stuff right tens are sometimes betting sometimes checking whatever the sets are mainly betting but you see the ev is the same and actually some of them are just checking back because well they have a reason to do so they will stay nuts if the turn is a king or a queen it's actually good for them so there's good stuff happening by checking back and letting villain catch up to a second best hand yeah so here it's totally fine it's not the highest frequency but given the the ev that's something you should do sometimes. Stefan decides to check back and the turn was the five of hearts. Again, flush getting out there is always a thing where both people improve to all kinds of more or less nuts, which means big sizes do not make sense. Big sizes force villain to only call or continue with a, But yeah, with just a few hands pretty much. And since everyone is protected with flushes, that's just not very effective. So what we see here, aces with a heart are a great block bet here. Let villain call his whatever jack of hearts and improve to a second best hand. Whatever, right? Give villain a challenge when you are bluffing yourself. Block bet bet and now interesting to see is we have a four percent raising range here nothing really makes sense to raise but the freaking check back pocket fours are the one so shout out to stefan here he found that race and it's easy to to see that as i have a boat i'm trapping but actually it's one of those boats that's still a little vulnerable, right? A seven of hearts, a three of hearts, okay. But a five kills you and a six kills your boat as well, a little. So that's the first one you want to raise to just get the money in now against flushes. And that's what Stefan decided to do. Aces with a heart are obviously very, very clear call. And now the fourth heart out there, the the jack of hearts i didn't allow too many donking sizings just the random all in and the small bet but we see that actually the aces with a heart want to bet donk bet pretty much every single time which is interesting right it's like okay the flush it depends all this is now very very very deep into the game tree where like, it obviously depends on, it's a reaction to the buttons turn raising range, right? And this is just now that every five X would check back now. And this is why you can donk your hearts here. And yeah, so that makes totally sense. The pocket fours are obviously the fist pump value gem and aces are indifferent to call. It's either a bluff or not. And yeah, you can sometimes fold that. You can sometimes call that, but I cannot blame anyone for doing so. So I decided that this is actually a hand that is pretty fancy, but both players played totally right regarding the solver, even though I typed in the wrong positions. Okay. I'll give you a second to read that hand history already, because this won't have a quiz, but just, I want to get some, maybe write me in the chat what your ideas are, why I did chose that next hand. It's just a pre-flop spot, pretty much. Pre-flop and then a small flop decision. Okay, so let's talk about that a little. This is Yasam Gale or whatever you want to pronounce him as. Ivan Galinets, I don't know. He is a very, very good creation high stakes player as well. And he decides to open raise 2.5x on the button. And now our friend Kevin, tax here, decides to 3-bet to $675, which is 13.5 big points. We have seen Stefan going to 600. We have seen Munir star going to 550 before, I guess. We are all that sizing differences obviously have a small change to risk reward. And this is what I think is very, very interesting here. And yeah, the creation guy decides to forbat to sizing it's like i mean more than than double like it but it's like of course he's forced to use a small sizing because putting out 1400 as a bluff here is pretty it's tough right because if tax year is jamming well he just needs to call,600 to play for a pot of 10,000, which is 36% equity. So it's really tough to end up with some typical bluffs like ace-queen offsuit, something like that here to then fold, right? If villain has potentially jacks and tens in a jamming range or whatever. So by just sizing up that much from the big blind, it actually kills the four bet range for imposition. And what happens is if you put that in a solver is that the four bet gets less and less interesting and gets more and more polarized in a way, right? That aces are still four betting small, kings are still four betting small. But what mainly happens is that something like ace king just jams now and builds a jamming range with something like pocket tents with some queen jack suited with yep just some of that i don't have a chart to show you now but it's just yeah ace king is not interested in calling against that sizing it's not interested in using a small four bet size, which you need to use a small four bet size here and then get called by all kinds of shit. So this is something that I think is really interesting because in that four betting range against that sizing, there shouldn't be any ace king pretty much. It's more like aces, kings, and some bullshit maybe. and then the question is is seven eight suited still a good call we're like three betting that with that sizing to then call it's i'm not sure whether that is making money i just didn't want to jump on that and just saying hey yeah it's a clear call this is because of this and that this is what the chart says because it's just every sizing and this is not something looking at the high stakes that we have seen very very good players using different sizings and therefore having different strategies already pre-flop button versus big blind so because there are lots of people who are saying yeah they are all playing alike this is like it looks like small stuff but it's actually from a strategic standpoint like very very very different stuff they are doing they are doing here. Now, thinking about the Croatians range here, I'm not sure whether that donk jam with the mid-peer from tax here makes any sense, right? 1.4 times pot against Kings, Aces, and I don't know what the bluffing range is like, right? Is it still something like Ace-Queen? Does he have that quite often or not? It's just a question I'm asking myself pretty much. All right. So let's get to the next one where we can look at the quiz. And that's definitely a fun one. So I will take the shoes of the in-position guy and I guide you through it. So my name is Flying Smile and I'm in middle position. I open race 10-8 suited and get called by the big blind. The board is really really bad for me. That's the big blind's board. So I decide to check back even my nut gut shot. The turn is as good as it can get turning like the freaking super nuts having a flush draw as well and I face a quarter pot bet. So I decide to raise a sizing that is actually more than the pot. I face the next more or less click back from, I could let you guys guess, but it's quite obvious that this guy must come from Brazil. And he's pretty much clicking back and I take my super nuts and decide to, yeah, sure. What else? Then clicking back again. And then the Brazilian guys calls. River is the jack of clubs. So the flush gets there. That guy checks to me again. And I'm jamming like pretty much pot size left. Get called by the 5-5 flush that had like a, I mean, double straight draw on the turn and the flush draw, obviously. I think this is a very fun hand. I'm not sure how much sense it makes,, I'm not participating. So this is up to you. Make up your mind. Sinhao is the guy who bet, re-raises the flop, then calls that click back and check calls that river with his five high flush and FlyingSmile is the guy who, who, well, is in position and sits there with a freaking super nuts all the time. Finally, Pascal, congrats for the lead. Two correct answers. Let's see who messed up here. Okay, so actually before solving that one, I was sure to click on the both of them as well. Like let's again do the the same thing, like in the format part before with tax years, ACEs, and just write me in the chat where you think, but I, I thought before solving it today that both of them messed up as well. So write me the answer for, for both, both of them. Where do you think does the mess up start? What is, what is the blunder? What is definitely not okay? Where are we roasting them for? Like just write the name and then write either for the check back, for the sizing, for the re-raise, for the river call, for whatever. Just something in the chat, feel free, just let's go. In position clicking on the turn versus 3-bet. Okay, min raise on the turn is props bad by Sinhao. I don't understand how he re-raises versus big blind yes see but small flop small for imposition i thought turn re-race mistake okay it's now fold should fold to large race so now small turn probe not okay flying small checking back flop but also raising turn with his hand all right sebarino here we go little spoiler spoiler, you couldn't be far more off from the truth, but this is how we learn. So great. There's correct stuff in there. And yeah, let's see. First of all, let's have a look at the ranges. In position, from middle position. In my cash game world, people are not having all the four or five suiteds, all the pocket threes here, for example. They have all the offsuit broadways. So 763 is really a fucked up board. While the big blind just has all of that, like all the connectivities around that. And that will lead to a strategy that actually the big blind could donk, which I didn't allow here because no one is implementing that. But that leads to a very, very, very small CBAT frequency frequency sevens partly checking back like 50 56 is checking back something like 10-8 suited checking back most of the time right it's just like we don't want to play three streets and open up open up our doors for a check race so definitely the check back with 10-8 suit is totally fine nine of clubs let's Let's get it here. So we see already Sin Hao. All the small bets. First of all, 25% to clearly attack something like king-jack offsuit, king-queen offsuit, ace-jack. All that kind of bullshit, which is offsuit hands. Queen-jack is like all shit. So it should lead to some kind of full equity. And five deuce, we already see it has like all options. Can play for a big pot and start with a big bet. Small bet is totally fine. So definitely not a mistake to bet small here. So small bet. Now, Severino said raising with his hand, not a thing on the turn. Definitely, it is 100% all raise here. And I offered even three raise sizes. Well, I needed that for the clickbacks in a second. but we see that especially 10-8 just loves the biggest sizing. That's more than a pot race. I didn't believe that myself first, just like having nuts disadvantage in position, but then raising very, very large with that 10-8. I think every bigger size is fine, but it's clearly, clearly, clearly, clearly better to get it in against something like 4-5 and 5-8 now before there is a one card straight. So we need to fast play our nuts on such a dynamic board for sure. That's very, very important. So definitely a good race. And now facing a race as someone who has the clear nut advantage being in the big blind, right? We have 5-8, we have 10-8 with pocket nines. Okay. So we definitely build a re-raising range against that. But what we see clearly is well, that click back is definitely not a thing. Right? Like that 1% will, will disappear if I keep that solver running longer that I don't know what kind of percentage that is that is not used either. So it's really, we see some, maybe some jamming even. And we see like some kind of, this is the two E sizing, the linear sizing saying, hey, you have pocket nines. I have a straight, let's go. Where, let's have a look what five deuce of clubs is doing. It's a thing. It's just five high, but every four gives it a straight. Every eight gives it a straight and obviously the flush card So it's something, if we raise now, well, we are kind of priced in with 5-5, or do we need to raise fold? I don't even know. So we could kill that option by just like jamming, which you see is like EV-wise quite an interesting idea. But there's one thing that we shouldn't be doing, and that's like the min-click re-raise that does really not make sense it's like the click back just does not fit to to any hand we want to play like that like what which hand does want to click back it's like it just doesn't make sense uh you you're just i mean you you have nuts and you have nut draws and you want to go directional in so why click back now and then leave a big bet for the river? It's like you take the same kind of linear sizing because your statement on the turn is pretty much, hey, I have more of the nuts. I go directional in. So this is what you should be doing with all your hands. That click back is just, this is the one that is not okay. And now what I thought is after the click back, that this is a clear call only spot against more raises that are, well, against more nuts that big blind is having. But actually the solver says, okay, the super nuts can click back again because they just want to make sure to get it in now, right? If the river is an eight, four or five won't stack off anymore. So that's kind of the problem. So I wanted to give shit to Flying Smile, I guess, for that in-position re-raise, but the solver said it's okay to do it. It's like maybe something we can simplify away, but yeah, it's very specific. And I unfortunately cannot give him shit for it. Click back, yes, is indeed more of an in-position thing. It's like if you click back out of position, it's more like, well, imposition can just call to see what you do next. It's like pretty much, this is imposition. You can, yeah, you have way better options because villain will check the next card to you again. And then you still have all options, checking back, putting out the next small bet in position. You can just pot control everything. So against the click back, now obviously we are in a game tree that does not exist anymore so i do this here and now again the five deuce again even against the click back what could be all kinds of is just jamming it's just like it's just too much equity it has to go in the middle in theory in the solver because in the solver well in position has bluffs for the click bag as well so i guess in game just calling here and trying to hit something is fine but yeah in the solver world it's like you see 110 more for the for the jam i mean we are in a game tree that does not exist and uh it's it's sin how who brought us there so yeah he calls and then the river is a jack of clubs i thought about whethering might make sense, but now we are really down a road that does not exist. So we see an empty screen pretty much. So why should we talk about it? And then, well, the 10-8 flush is a good jam. So that's okay. And yeah, so it was the Kahoot, I guess, pretty clear. We have our Brazilian friend definitely messing up here. I hope I explained it well enough that just his sizing doesn't fit to his range. Re-raising there, totally fine. Just the min-click is just some kind of bullshit. Yeah. Teneitsu checking 50% of the time. That was on the river when the flush gets there after five raises on the turn, where in the end you play flushes versus flushes and same hand versus same hand. There's like nothing worse that could ever call pretty much so yeah all right next one and it will stay fun because we have our brazilian friend sin how now still involved and i guess now he is playing another brazilian friend or definitely south america i'm not 100 sure maybe spaniard as well so definitely something going on here let me to you through the hand. This time I'll be in Sinhao's shoes and I'm three betting small mind versus button. My pocket six, you know, my queen jack suited. Queen jack suited. My fellow Spanish or South American friend Nutshell calls and the flop is jack 10-3. A pretty good board for me. I have all the broadways. I have Queens, Kings, Aces, Ace-Jack. So I obviously decide to c-bet that board with a sizing of 15%. We have seen Stefan with a 10% before. Now the 15%, I don't know whether it's cool or not. That's up to you to decide. And Nacho calls his pocket sixes despite those two overcards. Turn is an eight. I decide to check my queen jack here. I don't think I have three streets of value. And it goes check, check. And the river is a nine. So I have that jack. And I have that queen to make the straight. And I decide to bet 15% of the pot again, right? Risk those $252 to win those 1700s, get the value in, and Nacho decides to raise here. And well, I call with my straight, quite obviously. And yeah, I hope you already made up your mind. Let's see what's happening on the scoreboard here. Thomas, Evanor catching up. Pascal still in the lead. So good luck with this one. Let's call them both Brazilian. Let's give a big shout out to our Vamo players. That's a good Vamo hand. But who of them did mess up? Both of them? Is it actually fine how they played? Just one of them? Let's find out. Okay, good mix. Good mix here guys. And I thought about it, but actually I gave Nacho the thumbs up for that hand, or the solver did in a way. Now let's try and think about it again. Where did Sinhao mess up? Tell me, tell me in the chat, where did he mess up this time? The check turn, Sibarino says. Okay. The flop sizing, river bet sizing. All right. All right. All right. Actually, I forgot to load this one. Let's see. Where is it here? Flop and river. Yeah. Every, every street wrong. Where, where was action? What do you think about the river call? Is that fine? All right. So let's have a look. I actually, I didn't want to rerun that. I forgot the option of a bigger size on the flop. I only offered his 15 and a 30. A big bet, if I offer it, definitely takes place with some hands like queens and ace jack. But yeah, I didn't offer it here. But what we we see is clearly if we decide to only bet small or very small well the 30 is the favorite one and just that we can still range bet shows us that actually a bigger sizing should exist here as well and yeah queen jack suited it's just the small size is not a thing so ace king ace queen that will all be a be a mix. It all depends on your wardrobe, right? You can decide to only bet 30% and bet your full range. This is what we see here. That's totally fine. You can try and make it more complex and gain a little EV through that and build a bigger betting range that is like, again, consistent of hands that want to get money in now, but not necessarily later. Like pocket queens are a little vulnerable, pocket kings, ace jack. And then obviously you need to fill that up with bluffs, like ace king, ace queen, maybe with backdoor flush draw, whatever. So here that's, I guess I count that as the first mistake using a 15% bet. And now don't get me wrong, right? I called that let's roast them, but actually I actually i can't at all right everyone we are talking about today are great players and what they might be doing is just exploiting right it's like let's have a look in the game tree after betting 15 this year is in positions answer to that and you can see fold five percent if villain folds all his ace-eight suiteds and ace-seven suiteds, well, who is making the money? It's definitely Xin Hao, right? So they are not copying the solver, and I like that a lot, right? So it's really that they're giving interesting challenges. And Xin Hao chose that one time with a freaking clickback that't make sense in theory, but it's still a challenge. He's doing it here with a 15% bet where, well, you're not even allowed to fold seven, six of clubs all the time, which is ridiculous. But yeah, it's like, oh, if someone is over-folding here, folds his H4 suited, well, you make money because he's over-folding while you realize equity. But obviously, solver-, it's a mistake. Isn't Jack-10-X small and versus spot in a special three-bet spot where you can even over-bet or even jam on the flop? I mean, you can jam in four-bet pots there when you have like 1.7 times pot left. Definitely not in a three-bet pot. Over-bets can be a thing, but I wouldn't do it. It doesn't really make sense here. So yeah, definitely pocket six a very very clear call here. Now next step was eight of clubs and now we have two questions. How strong is the queen jack of hearts? Should it keep betting and if not should how strong or weak are sixes should they start bluffing? And now we are again in a game tree that doesn't exist which makes things complicated queen-jack is definitely one to mix here. It's not strong enough to go all the way. So I think Sebarino was you again saying the turn check is a mistake. The turn check is totally fine. And now let's see what happens next. Well, fours and deuses are weak enough to start bluffing here in position, but sixes still should have quite some showdown value just winning against villains ace five or whatever so that's a clear check so both of them i guess played the turn perfectly and the river i always need to look up nine of diamonds and a one card straight out there what we see is again both players have all kinds of nuts so very big bets are not allowed and yeah we see that small bet that normal, that normal small bet of 30% and that 15% bet. And actually on that river, the 15% bet is very, very cool. It's like you can value bet your set, for example, like that. I mean, again, we are in a game tree that does not exist. Just showing it like that. You can, yeah, you can value bet very thin with that. You can, whatever you do with your King, Queen is fine. And Queen, Jack fits in there as well. So yeah, the small bet. And then what we see is I could make that as a mistake, right? It's like, we see the raises from in position. It's obviously the straights, some random stuff. This year is not a value raise. And the sixes, I mean, I could make it a mistake. Sixes is not a good race i was i was very very polite with that one because there's like a little little trace play which i said i do not want to see and now let's think about that what's yeah let's let's ask that actually now if i could remake it it's a bad race and therefore a mistake but now okay i think it's close enough that you won't kill me for like making the quiz a little out of line there. But now the question is, why are pocket deuces a way better bluff than pocket sixes? You see pocket deuces are raising just all the time. Or a four or five suited. Tell me the difference between deuces and sixes here. All right, here we go. Deuces blocking fewer bluffs, right? We're not using big size here really to raise. We just need the folds. And we get them, folds, from? It's not, we're not using big size here really to raise. We just need the folds and we get them, folds from, well, not from the straight. We get some folds from the bluff catchers that decide to fold. And we mainly get the folds from, well, Dylan has air himself and folds. And now let's go back. What is he bluffing with? It could be something like six, seven. It could be sixes, fives, just in theory, even though it's not bluffing here. It's just, well, it could be something like six seven it could be sixes fives just in theory even though it's not bluffing here it's just well it could do it it's just like and therefore we are a little more balanced doing it with those deuces right so that's just the thing think about what villain could be buffing the a6 suited right a6 of diamonds here somehow is a bluff and yeah if we have sixes well that's a bluff that is folding to our race that is missing unfortunately with deuces we make sure we have that little frequency all right so that was that and let's see what is the next hand let me look it up oh next one okay we got great hands let's first have a look here any more no one pascal what is up click click the right. And it's two more hands, actually. I had three more hands. I forgot to save the last one, actually. That happens. Okay, so let's have a look at the next one. And we have Davy Jones and Sir W. Helmets playing. So Sir W. Helmets is a very good rec from Estonia, I guess. Davy Jones, I guess, is living in the UK, but is from Spain. I'm not sure. Pretty sure about the UK flag, though. So the spot is Davy Jones. Let's say I'm Davy Jones. I raise the button. Now Sir Helmets is raising in the big blind. Again, we see the difference 550, 600, 675. We need to adjust to that. And I obviously decide to call my Queen-Jack suited jack suited here villain decides to c-bet that deuce 3-4 rainbow board with 40 pot and i use a very very small race size with my queen jack suited just going total bananas i get called then the turn is a seven and yeah he checks to me again i decide to check back i give up my bluff the river the flush gets there i river my freaking top here and i face like a 140 percent jam i have top here i call so that's the whole hand who did mess up here what about the c-bet what about my click or small race here what about the river jam of of ace, ten of hearts? What about my call with my river top here? So Miguel got lost. Okay, let's do it again. Miguel, we want to have you in contention. So we have a three bet pot. The three bet or sir helmets decides to c-bet 40% pot on deuce three four rainbow davy jones raises small and gets called turn goes check check and dribber the out of position players now jams 130 140 percent pot which gets followed by a call and we see the fancy hands that both were full of shit all the time but david jones river is the top here all All right. I hope you have your answer already prepared. Time plays a role here as well. So who messed up? Out of position, Sir W. Helmets from Estonia or our friend Davy Jones from, I guess, England. Or both or nobody. All right. So we see like the number of nobody messing up decreasing over time. So I like all streets by Jones except on the turn. That's a very good one. Yes, definitely. Davy Jones messed up on the turn. That's correct. Maybe at other streets as well. So now this is a big question where I just said, okay, it's a big question about Sir W. Helmets, how to build your wardrobe on that flock. You can work with a big sizing, you can work with a small sizing, you can work with a small and a big sizing, or you go for some kind of trade-off. So I just gave him the option of betting those 40% and just saying his wardrobe is that trade-off, that's the only sizing he uses. And then that leads to a certain like 50 frequency ace 10 of hearts being totally fine as c-bet backdoor and flush draw gut shot obviously nice an ace and a 10 which is fine so that here so race sizes we could talk about having different race sizes as well i just said okay, okay, Davy Jones chooses that one size. It makes sense to just target villains here in the end. And yeah, so let's have a look what can race. Pocket fives can be a race. The sets are never a race. Jacks and queens can be a race. And all some kind, something like seven, eight suited, but something like jack 10 suited, queen jack suited can be fine race and all some kind of something like seven eight suited but something like jack ten suited queen jack suited can be fine as well right ev says it's like even to the call we definitely need to continue those hands and the race is fine we have good stuff happening for us villain is folding king queen villain is folding king jack we get called by ace highs that we have equity against. It's like, it's okay, right? So the race is happening. And now out of position, well, let's have a look at the ace tens. The one without the backdoor flush draw is folding. The ones with are clearly calling and call is the only option. We can fast play some of that stuff like pocket sevens, just like trying to get it in somehow against fives now fancy play some of the bluffs being like ace queen ace jack but okay so ace ten very clear call here and now let's see let's think about what is the calling range let's have a look the calling range is oh let's make it that again this time we're still in a game tree that exists calling range is broadways ace highs six x and thatx and that's about it. Another turn is the seven of clubs. Donking is not really a thing, like the seven does not change anything and mainly, that's why I showed you the calling range out of position, it doesn't interact with that at all. It's not a broadway card, it doesn't improve 5x or 6x. Where is it? Why does jack, do jacks like to raise more on the flop it's just more value it's like pocket jacks are sometimes raising pocket nines are not really making money and yeah the only difference is like yeah jacks have more value and against the next part that is interesting the raising range like that you mean here yeah it's it's just the stronger hand you see the ev but it's very close it's just yeah but yeah let me get back to that point here on the turn that for in position it's now the question he's full of shit pretty often but whatever he's targeting is like ace king ace queen king queen suited some kind of 10-6 suited and that doesn't connect with that seven at all so it's time now to really fuck villain up and facing that check what we want to see is really that small bet that attacks villains ace highs king highs 10-6 whatever this is a value bet with pocket fives right protection value bet and we can look at our, jack of spades. It's like it wants to bet. It wants like now betting small, that amount has fold equity, gets ace, queen, ace, jack to fold. We are pretty much cleaning our out if we river a queen or a jack. That is definitely the first mistake here. And now, okay, it goes check, check. And so far, Sir W. Helmuth is playing perfectly, right? And River now is the queen of clubs. And what we see here is now the ace-10. All of them are clear bluffs. And ace-10 of hearts is either a normal big bet or a jam. It's like, and he did jam, which is totally fine, right? Let's have a look at the jamming value range. It. Kings, aces, pretty much everything that beats a queen. And something like, well, the flushes. Well, that's all the bluffs. Whereas 5-6 maybe sometimes, ace-5 sometimes. And well, the flushes we are having. And now that's interesting. If we think about the cards that villain is having. Because queen is a river top here it's not beating any value hand and it does not have any blockers and therefore what we see here is that well queen jack suited shouldn't be in that range because it should bluff the turn but if it was it's like the clearest snap fold of all times it's really burning money call where yeah it's just it's not blocking kings it's not blocking Kings. It's not blocking aces. It's not blocking a straight. It's not blocking clubs. It's all blocking ace jack suited, which is a bluff, right? So it's really queen jack looks like a nice river top here, but it's actually a horrible 0% call here. So yeah, that's, that's a pretty clear. So we found the clear turn mistake and the clear river mistake from Davy Jones here. He won the hand, but still congrats to Sir W. Helmets who showed us how to play the ace-ten of hearts here, like the solver. So a pretty nice one. And now I guess coming to the last one. So I hope some of you got that right. Coming to the last one is this hand here. We have Nacho and Davy Jones again. This time Nacho being on the button. Open raising 120. Davy Jones defends by calling. The flop is ace 9-5. And Nacho decides to check back his pocket eights turns the, and now Davy Jones decides to start off the betting with a 150% pot bet with his top two pair. Nacho decides to just call his turn set, and the river, yes, Andy is raising his hand, just write in the chat, or if you just tried to try that button, that's all cool, just write in the chat, I have an eye on it davy jones goes for the 150 on the turn nacho calls his turn set and then on the three river i don't know is it a brick is it not deuce for a suit it gets there davy jones goes for 150 pot again and nacho jams for like i mean they started with 110 bb yeah check back. We have overbet, overbet, and then all in. What do you guys think? Let's first again, where is it? Look at the standings. And this is the last question. Let's have a look here. Thomas. Oh, Pascal. Yeah. Thomas in the lead, I guess. Pascal and Souray can still catch up. Maybe Fabs as well. Miho, I think we'll be close. So good spot for winning the festival t-shirt. But try your best now. I hope you all made up your mind, especially place number two to five. Make sure to click as fast as possible to have a chance and get more than 900 points in case you are correct and yeah so davy jones the guy out of position not sure the guy in position maybe no one is wrong maybe both are wrong maybe one of them is wrong and good luck all right so i won't show the total result before we we talk through the hand so maybe you have the sweat still on who won and again i'm after david jones here messing messing up a little and let me show you why yeah, I only offered one seabed size. I guess the small sizing on that board texture is quite standard. Let's make that big even. And we see pocket eights are definitely fine to check back. Would be a good seabed as well, especially having a club. So having a club likes to seabed a little more, but both options are fine. This time he decides decides to check back and the turn was the eight of hearts. What we see here now is well 265 in the pot. The one it's like a low betting frequency but when we decide to bet we go for a large bet 150% over bet. Ace-nine goes for a check which will end up in like being a check raise or in the overbet so turn who was it davy jones nailing it with a 150 pot bet definitely totally fine let's use that now pocket eights calling raising all cool let's go back we are in a game tree that exists so pocket eights calling raising all fine well. And river was a three, right? Three of spades. Okay. So six, seven is to the straight that pretty much just out of position has. Deuce four gets there that pretty much only out of position has. And now what we see here is, yeah, go big or go home, right? Deuce four suited is the clearest hand of all times that wants to get the money in. And you see the big EV difference even, right? It's like $60 difference between betting 1.5 times pot or all in, which is like four times pot, more than that, right? So it's like he has the nuts and villain will never have it. 7-6, freaking in his face. More than $100, up to $150 difference to just have that in your arsenal. And now we have the thing. Ace-9 is the same thing. Thank you. in his face more than 100 up to 150 dollars difference to just have that in your arsenal and now we have the thing ace nine is the same thing it's just like betting now to only get raised by pocket eights you won't get raised betting 150 you won't get raised by nine eight and this is the value you are missing here so you see clearly the the ev here again you're you're pretty much leaving 50 60 dollars on the table given you block everything checking is fine to to go for the EV here. Again, you're pretty much leaving $50, $60 on the table. Given you block everything, checking is fine to go for the check raise to balance that out a little. That's a fine move for ACE9, but just that 150% is just not a thing. You want to go big or you want to go home. And yeah, that would be the move. Once you only decide to bet that amount, pocket eights are obviously a very clear fist pump value jam here. But you see already, this is where you're like out of position is missing value. Ace eight is just calling. That's $3,000 you are not having. If you jam, ace eight obviously hates life, but needs to call most of the time. So this is very important to understand when we have runouts like that. And yeah, he should pure for, actually, I agree, right? It's like, I mean, in theory, some of the ace nines should check back the flop actually in the solver world, but right. And we see the river, river jam is like pocket eights, pocket aces and ace nine. And this is why ace and some bluffs, right. That contain eight acts. And this is why ace nine is a fist pump call pretty much. In the real world, I think this can be a great fault because villain will just always have pocket eights. But yeah. So yeah, I hope that that was a little fun. That was the last hand. And let's see. I guess there's maybe one more question here until we have, that's it. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. So lots of, lots of correct answers. Suray, congrats. I will message Hannes to make sure you get your festival shirt. So, so congrats on that. And maybe something you can take away from that, that is publicly available. Just Google for two plus two high stakes thread August. That's a new one every, every month. And it's super fun to read through that and even use it to learn, right? Did they use some wardrobes you would never think of? Some sizings you would never think of, right? Post that even in the hand history, in the hand history, say like, hey, I've seen that hand, I don't get it. I don't have the solver. Can someone write an Odin for me? Can someone, I have a solver, but I still don't understand it. Can you tell me why that is the case so that's something to on the one hand make fun of some some fancy place of some people that mess up maybe and at the other hand to just learn from the very best that are playing like 5k and nl 10k on a regular on a daily basis in the end and yeah now one last thing is obviously i want to announce my giveaway winner but but I guess that's everyone knows about that already. The little blog story I wanted to see about, well, people dreaming of winning or participating in our Poker Code Festival Bratislava. And yeah, Tim, I mean, I'm speaking to you. I'm not even sure whether you are here, but after you like put out the first post on the first day, no one, I mean, we had i liked a lot but it's just like yeah i mean tim you got the festival package i will see you at the bar there and that was just a pretty insane performance so yeah if if you didn't see that to all the others there is a special festival stefan giveaway channel in slack make sure to check out tim's awesome post there and yeah yeah, that's it from my side. And definitely meeting Tim at the bar for a beer and hopefully many of you more. And yeah, then I guess the next community coaching will be the week after the festival, I guess somewhere mid of September. And yeah, as always, give me some feedback in the feedback thread regarding that kind of coaching. There was more play style, more fun with the quiz and less of the, of the dry theory. I try to keep the mix. Maybe next time will be some more dry theory again regarding some, some spots. Until then, good luck at the tables guys.
