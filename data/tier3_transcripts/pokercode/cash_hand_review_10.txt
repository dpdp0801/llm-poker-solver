### TOPIC: cash hand review 10
 Alright, let's keep going with our review of MrPower2311. Again, I will stop at certain timestamps where he thought there was an interesting spot and he was unsure and will read out loud what his thoughts were to then discuss those. So far I'm super happy with this play and let's see how it continues. Here in the pot you see we had a small seabed and then discussed whether an overbet or normal bet is better in that spot on the six of spades. He mentioned the number of straights that the villain improves to which changes the whole structure of who is better doing in the nut region, who should be more inclined to build a huge pot and here it's actually a pretty okay card for for villains so i like the decision to only go with a normal sizing and here we are in that pot and let's see let's see a river or a fold fold would be great actually pocket five is obviously standard race and then it seems like there's quite a while of not much happening let's see or not too interesting i will still find stuff let's see all right we got the fold on the left and the fold on the right as well but i still want to comment on the right monotone boards are super super super interesting because well we have like different parts of hand groupings right villain has lots of flushes villain have has flush draws with every one diamond cards. Villain has pairs with a diamond and pairs without a diamond. Lots of different hand strength. And then obviously there are two cards that are neither a pair nor a diamond, which on those board structures are just super, super, super, super shit. And here actually, this is something that we can make use of. If we have the advantage, which we usually have as the open raiser, we can attack the weakest part first which means here we can use even smaller sizes i've seen you use the third part here i'm super happy if you go quarter part or if you even go 20 percent or that might be slightly exploitative because people are not adjusting their quality and raising ranges here properly to just go with a min bed for example right that allows you to see better at a higher frequency while still be protected so yeah something to mention here now let's see what's happening the next five six minutes until the next time stamp i mean four easy fold getting a walk is great jack three suited is close against the cutoff definitely a defend against the button depends on the rake environment i guess on lower stakes jack 3 suited is close against the cutoff. Definitely a defend against the button. Depends on the rake environment. I guess on lower stakes, Jack three suited is just a fold. At least some tank, I like it. So let's see that ace queen on seven, six, two. It's a board that is not really great for us. All the straighty stuff is more going for villain. And then I want to click the stop button if he bets here so nice so I like the check back seven six deuce realizing how good the board is for us or not villain has more 7x has more 6x if the turn is a 5 4 or 3 villain will have more straights if the turn is an 8 or 9 or 10 villain will have guess what more straights we have lots of offsuit broadways which are not really good here and now that means already we cannot bet super high frequency and the question is what do we want to bet though and usually we like to bet hands that benefit from getting both calls and getting folds at the same time which means something like pocket eights get called by seven and fold out jack ten offsuit right it's like both kind of good here ace queen yes we have enough draw at least right so we get called by worse hands or we get raised by worse hands or potentially worse hands on the river that's good but against flushes we still can get it in at any time by just like using large sizes on a non-peered board to just put the money in so that's not the biggest point it's more important what do we fold out and here we fold out random ace highs and random queen highs if we bet here a villain folds queen jack and this is a big downside because those are hands that we are actually like dominating to incredible like it's just queen jack with no diamond or with diamond is just kind of drawing that to us Right. He has like two outs the two non diamond jacks if he has the queen jack without so keeping that in Like quite promising now we hit our diamond Mainly see first what a villain does and then we should start betting small here We are attacking what we start to attack weak part. We want to fold out balance queen 10 we can start quite something here so i like to see the small step with nuts here another check would be fine as well but yeah so really like seeing that because this shows me how much more you understand than kind of random low stakes players right it's like you have a flush draw, you bet. Well, in general, that's not the worst thing, but here you understand the spot way more and see how ranges play. And I would say like that, you definitely make more money, even though betting and not flush draw is not a real mistake, obviously. Right, A7 suited, standard open. Jack five of spades, an open race first in as well Ace-nine suited sometimes a three bet or a call against Ultra tight player movie extra. I tend more to the to the call Yeah being a little more polarized with my with my three bats They are not expecting to get too many a7 suited calls there that it dominates so yeah so yeah this is very very interesting villain has the like one of the clearest range check boards of all times like the flush makes it super easy for us in position and the 763 just makes it very very good for us with all the straights. Ace-9 is obviously not the best hand. I think we still should float here, but with other hands we should be prepared in our mind to build raising ranges, to call and build the pot later. Villain is probably betting something like pocket-9s without a spade for protection if he's a bad player that just plays his hand in a way and doesn't understand the spot. So this is that is maybe ahead now but has huge troubles on all runouts and to target that we need to float all kinds of stuff obviously it's still easy to navigate here with having spades with having over cards or not backdoor straights yeah i think the fold is rather weak but not a real mistake call come on ah that's what i what i thought was so good before was really evaluating the board and then make like making the hand fit into the strategy here i mean i didn't read your thoughts here you didn't write anything regarding that spot i just see you struggle pre-flop where it's like yeah the spot screams like let's freaking wait and see more what's happening. King Queen of diamonds standard three bet I can see against this 3x here to sometimes actually just flat because 50 big blinds it's so awkward to three bet fold and it's just like not really the price to three bet call against not very aggressive players so yeah see it adjusting to the risk rewards that are building their king queen off would be actually a very i mean if we three bet that with a proper sizing we just have to call off and yeah now i like i like the way you played it here I think Jack off being fancy. No, just the call. Seven, five, three. Oh, we're three way actually. Could be if we really want to be crazy aboard to sometimes dunk.k, but yeah, not not really a thing Now it's just the question right it's like we have the advantage on that board after a round of check arounds We have four six suited. We have fives. We have threes. We have sevens How do we build our check raising range or betting ranges? Obviously King Jack has value but is it really two streets or is it more like one one and a half streets? We don't want to... Like, is Villain good enough to understand the spot and sometimes check back Aces and Kings? Well, that kills our value a little. If Villain is just calling down Ace-Jack, well, then that makes it tough as well. But anyways, with definitely a fish in the small blind tag, I think I want to take the initiative here, have the chance to get two streets from him and just pray for villain not to have ace jack and start betting 75 or here something like that here i think you run the risk of being a tail box here with your sizing i'd rather keep one sizing i've seen you bet 75 every here and there now you go like what is that like 60% i don't know just guessing something like that and yeah i don't like having that it's like so easy to be unbalanced to always click the the smaller one with the with the weaker size with the weaker hands and the bigger one with the stronger hands not saying that anyone is picking up but in a spot like that i like not to give away anything right so i want to have one size that i have here with strong hands with weaker hands with like whatever i want to bet yeah it's just something that boom like just like makes click in my brain that i see that 406 and it feels like yeah that's kind of king jack maximum not that i know your hand now but it's just not pocket fives just like no way ever so yeah actually his click is pretty cool in my opinion yeah wallet king six definitely find check back and now we have a call and pretty much 100% call nothing else we should do here so now on the right side I hope you don't start donking on a card that doesn't change anything. Check, check, ace, jack, yeah. He was scared of like facing the double barrel himself. So you got in the end the same money in as if you go for like normal bet size and then block bet. Yeah, I'm not sure what triggered him here. Like I think his play doesn't really make sense because it opens up the door for lots of re-raises i would have loved to re-raise with a very polarized range there if you bet your eight six suited and someone does that i'm kind of all in right not on the not on the turn just moving in but like saying hey i have actually the nuts here and then like re-raise linear sizing towards all in sometimes bluffing the river to really tell his ace-jack to go his side. So, I mean, king-six, nothing we can do. Check, check, here he double barrels, we have a nut draw, we are super protected with ace-axe and river at nine-axe trips, so yeah. So, what we can learn from that king-jack hand is be sure to not be sizing-tally there. Maybe you only use one sizing, I got it wrong, but it just felt that way. And to mark that guy that he's just like face up clicky playing his hand and to target that. Right, so now I finally see that we are playing NL50. So yeah, nice. Queen-2 suited, you open raise smaller now. I've seen you open raise bigger before, so I don't know why. Tight passive, no, what was purple? Let's go back quickly. I want to see that again yes the purple bad drag so but if bad drag means over folding big blind I love that right we have a knit in the small blind we have maybe a bad drag which could mean over folding big blind as well and you size up to allow yourself to play higher frequency I would love to see that exploit and yeah so good to see that you're not like super strict with your chart poker with like open sizes this just shows like clear thinking player adjusting yeah always great to see 7-8 off should be a mix first in I need villain to really be a good good rack that is potentially better than me to not open race here yeah maybe we have higher rake structure on l, that we need to tighten up a little. That could be a thing as well. Queen on off, high frequency three bet. I hope you roll your dice. And let's see, soon there is a timestamp again. Aces is a very high frequency four bet. With high, I mean, 100%. There's no reason for trapping in that spot here I have no clue why you go that big I mean you could say okay if he's a bad rack or a nitty guy he always has something and doesn't have a folding range this is why we go big but if you are ever bluffing which I like doing against the small blind especially because in the small and usually people are not too tight because three betting is mainly their only option. I want to use my bluffs to kind of kill your risk reward here. Like this is a very big four bet size for in position so if you had a reason that's cool if not I think this is just too big. Queen nine no other option than calling. And now the right side hand will be something we will discuss in a second where he gave a timestamp i mean now villain on the left side keeps betting on that card where you have any queen in this world i guess he needs to downsize quite a bit here sometimes betting bigger is definitely okay but just like something that is important to spot and now if he has anything that is not a queen he's just deeply in trouble but yeah okay now let's talk about the right side we see a four bat pot where i think you use quite a big four bat sizing and then we have seen a triple barrel let's just scroll back a little and double check on the sizes because this is what you are referring to in your comment and i just read out loud for everybody again i went for geometrical sizing on all streets which is about 40 to maximize villain's calling range yes maximize his calling range i'm not sure this sounds kind of exploitative so whenever we build a range that is either nuts or nothing geometrical bet size is our friend because this just allows us to make use of our our stack the best right villain is forced to always call the right frequencies like it's good to make maximum examples there if we don't do geometrical sizings it could be anything like we bet 1BB, 1BB, and then jam the river. That's way worse because Villain has way less decisions. So this is just the game theoretical background that linear sizings optimize your EV when you are the player having nuts or air. Here, this is the question what our range is. So your sizing is perfect if your range is pocket aces and deuce three offsuit all right then you bet aces all the time with linear sizing and the deuce three offsuit you add just like with the right proportions now we have a different spot because your range should be like kings and aces maybe some ace queen maybe some king jack suited maybe some ace king maybe some pocket tens even stuff like that that have we have different interests combined and it's not necessarily that we have only nuts or air because well what is our bluffs something like ace queen well that has freaking 25 against pocket jacks that villain could have so it's a little different so our goal here on the flop is to use a sizing that makes sense against villain's range and i think we can easily get away with the range bet here and i don't hate your size it's just like the geometrical doesn't make the most sense for me i like to choose a sizing that hurts villain the most so it would be interesting to see is villain flatting seven six suited but to attack that you see flatting pocket sevens eights nines that are just like on this board because they either have two outs or they only have 75 against our overcards so something like that knowing something about villain's range just does he only have like ace queen and ace jack suited whatever so i like to go slightly smaller here and then have like the polarization spot where i start attacking villain jacks and queens where i mainly say hey i have kings aces or something that then doesn't have much equity anymore on a brick turn this is where i start going into linear sizing and this will often be like that like finding on the flop a small size that attacks like the weakest part of villain's range if that has equity against some of my parts like here six seven suited for example against my ace queen and ace king and then start polarizing which means linear sizing on turns which is pretty much nothing else we do in single ice pots like starting small and then start over batting stuff like that so yeah but on that specific board actually i like the slightly bigger flop size just pointing out against the theory of the geometrical size a little more and we have seen that already see did we get the call while watching the hopefully getting the call there on the right we should talk the left hand as well because you gave a comment here on the river. So we faced a half pot bet on the flop. Turn, we faced a three quarters pot bet, which makes it very easy for us. We continue probably our two pairs. We probably, I mean, we have infinite queen next, so we are protected. Usually that means villain has something. And yeah, on the river, your question is, not sure if I have a river value bet with the queen there when the board pairs thought having the nine allows me to be greedy since i block many full houses and i can get called by jack 10 or 7x agree 100 right it's like not that the queen 5 is a clear value bet villain might think oh you bet any queen anyway so i check jam my boats which means again he needs to first bet a two-pair or a set on the turn, which I do not really see. I think we are free-rolling here in a way and can have, like, a normal bet size with, like, some super-nutted boat and some, yeah, like, I'm not sure whether I want to have some overbets, but, I mean, I'm betting this one here. Nine makes a difference, definitely. Or or any read like that this guy is just face up and probably never betting is set on the turn could be a read we could have all right getting that call down here interesting people like calling i mean the queen smashes your freaking bluffing range so his Jacks are just I guess a very bad call on in those positions. Okay waiting for the next spot here we go okay. Ace for offsuit, easy open I mean it's close already but still easy. Easy open. Three deuce, pretty brickish card so I want to see high frequency c-bet here for sure. Jack six twos. Yeah, one of the so-called trade-off boards. We cannot see that very high frequency, but we shouldn't range check either. It's like a mix. Ace-10 is okay to build a pot with. We have the 10 of diamonds. That's an upside. We have two nice cards for the ace and the 10. So this will be a clear mix between check and bet. Something like the the ace eight of clubs would be more of a mandatory check and yeah now going from there i guess ace 10 still is like no value bet against other ace highs or no reason to fall out like not really and therefore it's a check and then yeah mainly just a fold just important that to realize even with good hands that the four is not our card either to build like check raising ranges here as well to still have like somewhat strong hands to check call. I think the ace ten is yeah it will be a sometimes a call maybe in Pio but doesn't have any nice things really going for it. I think that was already the spot you were talking about here with the timestamp I thought villain could easily be over bluffing on the turn and I didn't block any spade backdoor flush draws although the ten of diamonds is not that great so thought I could bluff catch turn blank rivers like the four of clubs. Yeah it's the question why is villain starting to bluff the turn if you didn't start to bluff the flop. It's just one of the very very typical under bluffed spots it's not like there were lots of offsuit straight draws that just started going and it's not a spot i love bluff catching and your hand is more like super random like yes you don't have spades but is this the one that villain starts betting all the time it's kind of random i think i don't like my 10 really but if someone's over bluffing yes your call is great thing is i king-queen again, having clear six outs. Like, villain is usually not really bluffing on that ace-river, so would you donk it to get some extra value there? If you river a 10, you're still just purely bluff-catching, so it's not that great either. Yeah, I'd try to really... I mean, we can look it up in Pio, and it will be just a random close 0 EV call, but I just think that this is more an under-bluffed spot. never be great will never be horrible like one of those spots okay seven six suited on the right sometimes squeeze mainly am i wrong i mean i can see the fold with that strong flap behind but i cannot fold the suited connector three-way we shouldn't fold the suited connector three-way. We should fold the suited connector three-way. King-10 of diamonds, let's see. Sounds like a pretty three-battable hand. Maybe not against a nitty small blind though. Okay, so do we have a spot here? Okay, so now the pocket tens will be the interesting hand. Let me read out loud again. Originally, I wanted to bet small with pocket tens to allow villain to check raise all his drops, but I rolled very high, so decided to protect my check back range this time. Turned not sure if I should have raised and started puking at the river wanted to raise because i was afraid i missed a lot of value but in the end decided to just call since i would only get called by eight x especially since i blocked most of the two pairs which might sometimes bluff catch so yes i think again we have a board where nuts will change this is a main factor when nuts change we freaking need to bet our super nuts. Just imagine there is the 8 of clubs on the turn and you won't get the money in against deuces. This is the worst thing that can happen. So stop the excuses with the randomizer to sometimes check back a hand like that. That's especially on lower stakes. This is burning money. So a small bet, have him call his freaking king queen, hit a king get the money in. Small bet, have him check raise a hand that has low equity against you with a draw, then call and let him barrel. That's fine. Bet small, get check raised by pocket deuces, start building a pot. If the turn is the five of hearts and he bets big again we freaking jam our nuts to be sure to get nuts over nuts in. When boards are dynamic, protection is not really a thing. You can check back some jack nines here that you have nuts on an eight. You can check back some eight, nine even if you want to have nuts on those cards. You can check back some low flush draws to be somewhat protected here. But don't use the super, super nuts to protect right so this just does not really make sense and i'm just saying as well on l50 no one is going super crazy for your unprotected ranges so yeah definitely don't don't don't check pocket tens here that is kind of this is why i try to be so strong like really talking in a strong way about that. This costs EV and this is one of the problems when using the randomizer to a certain extent. There are spots where the randomizer can help. We are unsure and we don't want to bluff catch 100% or 0%. We don't need to go black or white. If we don't have a read, we can say we only we only exploit a little we overfold a little or not but the main decisions should be kind of pure so yeah and now against half pot with super nuts again very very very mandatory race you want to get money in against deuces now before there's the eight of clubs on the river that's so here absolutely mandatory race everything else is just burning money and that half pot is just never a straight so we can use a big race anyways all right so we burned some huge money on the flop we burned some huge money on the turn now hate our lives and have a bluff catcher with a flop super nuts half pot into size up like this is a random eight all day long uh yeah i think we don't have a race now anymore. King-jack, random bluff, okay. Alright, so against that hand we maybe won the maximum, maybe against a small bet he check calls and then we go from there. But really, this was like this, I love the play so far, but this nuts check back or the thought in one of the first hands, or the first part with the not raising ace- those are massive massive punts just maybe you had the example there yourself with a pocket aces right if you trap that for some reason and do not get the money in against someone who is willing to call down jacks in that spot where it's like really really really tough for him to be winning i don't know what against but yeah so yeah this is maybe the best example to just make sure to build the pot when you have it there's no reason in those spots especially to protect something when the board is actually quite dynamic so now we have the next spot small blind versus big blind stingray's pot checked through river. I thought pocket deuces doesn't have much showdown value anymore and turned into a bluff to fold out 4x, 8x or better pocket pairs without a diamond. I like that. I think maybe it's a little overdoing it because we could have like... I mean no actually all that is a little connecting. I just like it right. It's we are not only folding out maybe better hands but we are preventing villain from bluffing right he will probably fold his 10-7 of hearts that he was too scared to be bluffing but if we check to him he bluffs us off and we obviously cannot call so yeah i like the bluff seeing on that board that we are i mean maybe it's not our nut low but i'm just i was thinking about like three five of hearts stuff like that but we are probably betting that before at some time we were checking an ace high board we were checking an actually very good card for us on the turn so it's really tough to get there with with really air and we can have a nine six of spades sure but i like it it's very tough to be over calling that spot and yeah he has a diamond that's fine I guess the left-handed table might be the last hand. Let's see. All right, jack, eight, seven. Boom. This is a three-bet pot. Wow. We have sevens, eights, and jacks. We have nine-tenths suited. Villain has sevens, eights, and jacks, and now is the difference. He has a very high frequency compared to his range. He has nine-tenths suited, seven-eighths suited. Willen has 7s, 8s and Jacks and now's the difference, he has a very high frequency compared to his range. He has 9-10 suited, 7-8 suited, all the flushes, everyone has everything. This is like, alright, break here, right? We need to slow down, it's super easy for Willen to react. Obviously it's not wrong to put in a small bet with ace-king here, but anything more than that, I think check is more the standard. Monotone boards are lots of mixing and yeah then we go from there that small bet now we fall out pocket fours without a diamond that's about it for now again it's important that there's not only one bet sizing right it's not that here three bet pot is always bet bet direction all in 75 is our only option what is there to attack still pocket eights pocket sevens pocket jacks nine ten suited king queen suited king ten suited whatever four five suited for villain five six suited yes we block the ace of diamonds in theory he has all the nut flushes as well but we can block that again for example we can check again and now maybe a little hint here because now reading out what you thought here i was not sure what my line is here on the turn torn between check jam bet 2e or even smaller choose a sizing so that exactly pot size is left on the river to maximize fold equity then this is a good idea so i don't like the 2e sizing really because it doesn't give villain any trouble i don don't like the check jam for the same reason. And maybe one hint here is always that your hand needs to fit in certain hand categories. So I won't use the lookalike principle here. How would you play a nut flush? The answer is you don't care, right? Maybe the ace king of diamonds you want to check a little more to have villain's bluffs going. Maybe the ace five of diamonds you want to bet more to make sure king and queen of diamonds are paying so nut flushes can be all in any point doesn't matter how do you play pocket aces with the ace of diamonds that is another look-alike i don't want to get all in here not at all so this is not an option check jamming is out of question here for me for that reason pocket kings with or without the diamond i don't know i want to charge a little more from villains ace jack of spades king jack of spades queen jack of spades eight nine of spades pocket tens with or without a spade so i feel like checking is cool and the small bet is cool a big bet narrows my range down to pretty much nut flushes and this is very thin like yeah so i like i'm not sure didn't run lots of mono boards lately but i rather see a small bet and then go from there and a check with the option to check raise small maybe even and play all the streets but definitely no 75 percent bet here or just a check jam this would be i think overplay let's see how the hand continues that's like i don't see you mentioned like maximize fold equity by betting like exactly the size to have pot size left on the river to maximize folding. Why is that the case? Why is it pot size on the river? I think taking a size that makes sense for another range part of yours makes a lot of sense. And then you can still value jam the river. Maybe it's or like not value, but like bluff jam for 150% pot. And then you are like, okay, until the turn you can have kings and aces. on the river maybe it's or like not value but like bluff jam for 150 percent pot and then you are like okay until the turn you can have kings and aces on the river you are representing the nut flush that's it right this is what you do with the ace of diamonds so yeah maybe this is a board that makes a lot of sense to to to be running to learn something from from it i'm not sure about how theory is in that spot myself 100 it's like going with my little little guidelines and trying to make sense of the hand there and yeah anyways as a little summary overall we have seen some great plays right some lots of easy spots or like rather not not easy spots but frequent spots that you played rather perfectly we have seen one or two in my opinion big puns which was trapping trapping with nuts on dynamic boards i will repeat that three times don't trap nuts on dynamic boards get in nuts over nuts right now make sure to get the money in people love paying more than they love hammering on on weakness yeah this is something you can do as an exploit against very specific opponents but not in general don't use the randomizer as an excuse to do fancy checks or something. This is, I don't need that playing 5k. You don't need that playing an L50. This is just get the money in there, right? To exactly the king-jack hand. You had pocket tens, villain had king-jack. To get that exact money from his hand, any pair was good. Like you wasted your pocket tens. You used a top set to, in the end, bluff catch end bluff catch so yeah this was like the wrong candidate maybe you triple barrel something that gets called and then it's actually behind so it's like misuse of the hand in a way and besides that i liked everything i've seen i understood in your comments that you have a very very good fundamental understanding of the game just the things you talked about were really really great and actually i like the format a lot thanks for the footage mr power and yeah i hope everyone else could learn something from that as well enjoyed it and maybe you're the next one that i give a little little review here and see but yeah main point is we're learning all from that and yeah thanks again mr power and everyone else good luck at the tables whatever stakes your plan
