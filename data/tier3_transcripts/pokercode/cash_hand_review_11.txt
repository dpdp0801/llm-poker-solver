### TOPIC: cash hand review 11
 all right today i have again a another type of video for you guys one of our very loyal cash game recs here just posted his stats again i didn't have a look at them for now because this year didn't look too promising 40k hands like slightly losing huge losing red line i don't know would be better to have that in bb per 100 actually this is minus two so this has to be like minus 10 something about that which is probably not too wild but before just like because he even mentioned like where is it yes i overfold to three bets randomizing a lot and not always calling my sevens middle position versus button or my jack ten suited cutoff versus big bind so like the typical things i mentioned in lots of the database reviews i pretty much answered him like just send me the hand histories of one typical sessions to have a little more of a deeper look. And what I want to do today is just actually have a look at the session he sent me. It's 496 hands. And I write down stuff that I think is like maybe a mistake, maybe not, or something to look into to just have tendencies. So we play like a 28, 24, 15 style, which is incredibly loose. 500 hands doesn't mean much. I will open a little list here and just write down bullet points that I feel like, okay, maybe this is a tendency this guy has. So we can then double check them whether that fits to the stats or not, right? A little different way of how you can figure out things yourself a little to just combine things. And I hope we're getting something here. So I'm actually just clicking through all the hands I'm having where something happened so this year rather standard obviously let's make it big ace five suited open race won't be using the stats actually let's kill them all right so we can range bet that board and villain starts to check raise on the larger side I think it's obviously a standard call like I'm just folding the ace five of hearts where I have no outs against his two peers and so on but with the backdoor not flush draw I think we have a mandatory call on the turn his size I think is not great he should have the clear jack nine and six nine advantage so I think he can size up here and we have a rather clear fold just especially the two pair thing that just like we don't have three outs against this ace 10 a7 really sucks yep so far so good jack 10 suited using small bet a larger bet from under the gun here on that board would work as well this year can define his range a little more forcing him to check raise more of his jack 10 pretty much that we can hammer on him on the turn definitely want to see that over bet here so yeah multiple options that seems absolutely fine pocket tens against an mp flat i think on that board against an mp flat i prefer to bet yeah it feels like this is a blind versus blind play where we could bet a lot as well i think i'm just betting smallish against nines eights and so on and then start attacking like his ace jack king queen whatever he might have here and now i'm freaking blasting or going for the check raise i have the nuts now i think i prefer blasting actually not i'm indifferent but just like i don't want to see like a three-quarter pot bet now okay this seems fine like blasting seems fine to get max out of like queen jack type of hand if he is the type of guy who has pockets all the time i might check again just like two outs to then win a huge pot is still something but yeah definitely not going something weird there okay ace king versus a cutoff flat yeah more or less mandatory check here check check and i think now we should start betting people are not checking back flushes people sit on pocket eights pocket sixes pocket fives here when they flat that all day long so i have that equity do you want to check call here not really i think this is a mandatory bluff to be honest and now i was scared that you check call here because we see it but he doesn't even go for the value bet i go for like three quarters on the turn and then blast pretty much any non-spade river maybe one thing right so let's write that down on that list missed delayed bluff as aggressor right so just something i write down we find more like that and then we have something proper going on the others are raise and take that's fine let's go to middle position all right so we have a six suited small blind flat i think we can just keep betting here it's tough to like do we have reads on the small line flatting range here it usually is like broadways and then it is pockets i think none of that folds right now so it's more like yeah we can keep our range together and keep betting or we have a plan and just attack his sevens eights nines and barrel twice i think this seems to be a fine check and now could be a bluff or just an easy fold this seems reasonable open race is for suited facing a three bet from someone i think this is mainly a fold actually where is it i have a pile on the side here it's slightly different sizings button versus cutoff three bet pot this is the out of position flatting range if we were i think this year sizing is using like 2.5 and then like 8.5 so relatively this is a slightly smaller three bet which makes our call slightly better this is solved for zoom 500 break zoom 100 break or whatever this is is higher than 500 so i think we are just good just folding stuff like that and then villain has a rather easy range bet on that board and we have a pretty indifferent like ace four of hearts would be a fold already and ace four we can check raise that we can check call that but not with a lot of hope so it's a thin call but once we are in there this is just what i mean like just folding that and not playing spots like that when you're not like crushing the games right now anyways i think just makes a lot of sense no clue what this guy is doing then just calling the block bet um so maybe this is our reason for the preflop call that this guy is just a whale i don't know but yeah that would obviously make up for that and i think post flop i'm fine with that okay six seven suited same thing cutoff versus mp but you mentioned that already cutoff versus mp you mentioned that you roll that in it should be in your calling range like 19 of the time where if i look at in theory we're not open raising at sevens like we shouldn't open raise it in that rake structure in yours even less somehow something that is yeah i'm not really understanding too much why that is the case probably just not enough equity and once we face a lot of three bets not the greatest of all hands so what happens here is i'm 100 sure you open raise that 100 and then maybe you roll 50 50 and then you end up 50 with that hand in that range while you should only have it like 19% according to those charts here. And we are again, higher rake doesn't make it better for you. So just knitting it up in those spots or if we say the open race for sure is plus CB, then we can just overfall to three bets because we had an exploitative open race. If this guy is just a bad player and we have a clear read where our money is coming from, for those hands, it's like either paying us off big time if we hit which i don't know like aces and kings should pay off or he's just like more playing face up with ace king ace queen that we can navigate a little better or find nice bluffing spots that would be more the stuff where the eb has to come from that we can play profitably here and yeah so just two times the same thing i write it down call three bad out of position high rake structure rather light okay and then maybe take a passive line in the pad right this is what i mean with the ace four of diamonds that is a hand that is like a 50 percent check raise if you only have it like sometimes in your range that's kind of your four acts look alike with the backdoor flush draw added and yeah you went for the check call which is like because you talked about the red line as well obviously if you just blast that and end up bluffing your stack off sometimes here you will do something for your red line not saying that that is better but i'm just writing it down right so we have a check call here i think check raising on that parrot board is not too cool turn king obviously terrible card him checking back shouldn't happen often here so it just clearly means he has showdown values so i'm not sure whether i like the block bet here too much i think it's more of just to give up even though it hurts but on those stakes just folding something out is not really wrong to try so let me just see where is it cutoff versus mp let's just run that one quickly. Jack of club, jack of spades, nine of spades. I just take my sizings. It's fine. And we faced. Okay, so this is like 30%, I guess. And we offer ourselves block bet. And let's just run it quickly. All right, he raised. Okay, that sucks. Maybe the 10 is just like, what is it checking back on the turn? Like a weak king, a pocket queens, pocket 10s. That's just like the best card in the deck for him. And I guess we just can't do anything about it right pocket fives big blind three bet this is 2.2 not 2.5 he makes it 12 not 10 not 11 he is like this i don't know i show again one range that i saw like the friends of mine solved for high three betting ranges from the big blind where is it the button versus big blind where you see on the top right the zoom 500 charge for button versus big blind three bet and you see the same we're like i'm saying button doesn't matter you see in position this is why i called it this year in position instead of button versus seven percent where pocket fives is more like of a ten percent call just to have it in our range if villain like makes any reads on that and could like know something post-flop, that we just mix all the pockets and that even pocket tens are indifferent. And this is the spot we are facing here. I think villain is even, yeah, most likely having less of a range than 7%, which makes it worse. And the bad thing is that he gives us such a bad price, right? We could argue like, okay, he's so tight. We stack him if we hit, but if we have to pay like $9.80 to see a flop every time, it's just, no, won't work out. So I'm a big fan of just folding every single time here. And obviously this fold is good, right? So even though I know, you felt like I give you shit for that, so I write it down anyways. You wrote in the thread that you have those mixed folds. Like we have put in position, call incredible price with low pocket, right? I'm going to go We can see that. Fine half pot on that board seems fine calls on the turn we want to have hearts we don't want to have diamonds too much so clear check i guess we have showdown value river another value bet nice hand ace queen offsuit small blind flat whatever that means we can start betting our hand anyways turn pretty clear bet i would say and yeah nice hand again that's it we got so far four bull points that's not too bad and now let's have a look at the jack jack nine hand so first of all see how tiny that six seven suited here is we check we face the range bet our six seven suited on a paired board is not too interested in check raising so we are rather check calling with our flush draw turn was the king of clubs obviously no donking villain should bet a lot on the small side which means well his check means something it's like tens and queens i talked about eights and sevens would be the other hands that just want to check back we block sevens eights yeah he needs to have it in his three betting range obviously and that's it so this will be interesting on this river card ten of hearts where seven six suited is just yeah it's like kind of expected we check 76 we are on a give up we can't even bet a queen really so we are like polarizing to a boat or nothing in a way because the card is so bad just have a look here runouts ev comparison to see out of position ev on the certain river cards and the 10 of hearts okay nine would be even worse oh another jack villain has lots of king x yeah another jack is even worse jack and king okay so 10 9 is just not as bad as a jack or a king that makes a lot of sense okay cool all right middle position done let's go to the cut of them or let's write that down like you know what i mean with a zero percent like bluffing something that you cannot really bluff and this is the one like i just write it down that doesn't hurt right it doesn't hurt just like trying on those stakes usually is a good idea so i don't want to talk it out of you but yeah okay this hand limper iso someone over calls we face a min dong call it's like a check around villain min dongs the turn not min dongs but like that's smallish whatever that is i raise okay and for half put left nice nice donation pocket eight it's a very very very different spot here 220 to 12 like here we need to pay 830 instead of 10 dollars 80 that's a major major difference in in like risk reward so here again this hand in the chart is indifferent but yeah it's like i'm way more inclined to find the call button here and this year against the big blind range this is just a freaking freaking freaking fold like no clue how you want to make the money if you don't bink the eight on the turn right so i've seen that in the preview yeah it's like okay let's write that down low pocket against freaking strong big blind three betting range so like where's the return from this here coming from like yes he can have ace king which has like incredible equity against you anyways he has king queen he has whatever and even an eight is not giving you the the nuts like yeah no this is a horrible call even though pio will tell you it's zero eb but pio will have a different three betting range here where there's some king seven of diamonds that will check fold the turn so yeah big fan of the the flop fault here is five suited with his three bad we could sometimes we could four bat we could call both fine check check on that board and then double flush draw here actually this is one where i always mess up right now these days when i look up double flush draw turns how to stab check of diamonds seven of diamonds five clubs i think i'm mainly checking this one again yeah i think i'm mainly checking this one again that cannot really hurt i'm just thinking about which sizings overall i'm using how much i'm polarizing here that's why i'm not 100 sure about this type of sizing here and then on the jack i think we have a rather clear give up with our hand so that's fine just an unfortunate river card yeah let's see let's see i mean if i'm unsure it will be somewhat fine but let's just see what what the play is here jack 10 suited all right check call right so here again this is obviously one that we could check race right this fits to our take passive line with indifferent hand do you put out of position right maybe double checking this game tree a little how much you want to check raise when do you want to check raise especially those hands that have tough time on the turn and this hand would like to see two more cards and you cannot check all turns you can check jam clubs but that's about it now we could talk about a donk but not that much because it's like we don't block anything and he has a range bet so all kinds of queen eggs in his range and yeah this is exactly the problem that we would try to find a way around with a check race uh just to do it sometimes right so first let's double check the jack seven five check villain obviously should bet a lot his ace five check back okay check check turn was jack of clubs and we have our ace ten of diamonds where okay right what do we try to do we go directional in or we block bet and say we have a random peer like pocket tens pocket nines your 75 percent is not or a 70 percent or whatever it's not the preferred one ace 10 of diamonds can fit into any range kind of a joker here yep block bet to make ace king ace queen different right away represent a peer represent something nutted fold out that certainly and having equity against calling issue makes a lot of sense i guess but just a little off size in here but this is not a pattern or anything yeah because it goes so fast let's double check the jack 10 as well whether i call bullshit here or not just offering a couple of more things to have a look at the turn again to have villains half pot size here but yeah pocket aces three bats small c-bat keep going vault pocket jacks four bats sevens interesting like okay check check yeah not doing anything here nice hand king ten of hearts again where is it the same like the ace ten suited i would say let's have a look at where's my other pio i have two piles open I thought to have a look at ranges maybe cutoff versus button so this is a cutoff versus button for betting range all right probably you're mixing anyways but you ended up calling ace-10 suited and you ended up calling king-10 suited which is both like a clearly more than 50% for bet and this is kind of a typical scenario why I like three betting very very light because people under four bat a lot this is for different sizings so maybe the big sizing that you use and I'm mainly using remember I'm doing that against linear ranges if the button plays a flatting range here as well and four batting smaller I think you did like 24 last time so just to have that in mind but like it seems like something might be slightly off not four batting a lot which I see the first pattern maybe you guys can guess it already right just like yeah think about it for a second which pattern are we seeing here i think that we see that you put yourself into a non-favorable spot right it's not being the aggressor as being like calling three bets out of position you call with hands that were indifferent between calling and folding i found you in this session just calling all of them now i found you with indifferent between calling and for betting you went for the call as well both leading to a scenario where you end up in a three-bet pot out of position with a somewhat speculative hand instead of having the fold equity on your side right it triggers in my mind i see the red line right away just because of that okay let's just double check and then the next thing is the flop as well right going for the check call but i wouldn't hate the ace four of diamonds to check just check fold like it's like slight ev to check call if villain has the perfect range there he played his ace king kind of weird so i think we can have a read that he's a weaker player we're definitely not folding but not seeing that check race and then here let's see how often range bet jack 10 of clubs right it's like not even 50 it's like 40 but again a pattern right you can obviously tell me that you mix all those and i was just lucky or unlucky to find always the passive line or we have the first clear pattern right i would say all those mixes you probably call a jack 100 you probably call ace 10 100 just my guess, right? You probably call ace four suited 100 You take four or five suited sometimes and then it's just those 12 percent check rates are just missing where this actually gives villain trouble Like what is he doing with an ace king queen right away with an ace jack with an ace 10 offsuit? What does he do with the pockets? What does he do with the suited aces people are three betting that cool check eyes doing limper all kinds of sizings are fine aces take it all right so cut off clear patterns i would say but this was a horrible button there's some more i think we mainly get the seabed through but anyways just flick them through quickly king eight suited c-bet i'm just range betting here seven seven x is still fine with the backdoor flush drawing two overs we need to call this is absolute garbage that he is doing there this is even worse and then he hits a queen okay okay i'm just thinking about yeah we should have show on value but we want to we want to beat ace five ace three so it's like bluffing that all day long as well he just messed up completely and you got owned by that that's cool nice hand from your side not from his so okay pocket nines three betting against the 3x guy hold okay iso limper i think about both i think about bluffing river and i think about bluffing turn it's like what is villain floating villain is either having something like a seven a six a ten nine or eight right a nine or eight is probably folding on the turn like an ace eight type of hand or he has like some high cards with a heart like a king queen of hearts king jack of hearts we fold out like dominated stuff so i think my queen jack just triggers as like the the lowest over cards you can have being dominated by other over cards like just think about how happy are you about a jack on the river after check check on the turn. How happy are you about a jack on the river after betting the turn. Like it's a very very different scenario. So I'm like very heavily in the bet turn camp here. I mean I could hide his hand to not be biased there. The next time probably works. So yeah I write it down anyways. Missing potential good double barrel. The river bluff is kind of whatever I guess. Next limper here here again against limpers i just start doing something against that sizing i see one more mainly but i totally understand that the fold right if he makes it 850 i'm folding as well this is just i see more i like to see more cards maybe he tells me his hand oh he even tells us the hand just because of the sizing though wouldn't call that a mistake though ace five offsuit what happens here 220 340 okay boom check check not doing anything against this okay this is the money he gets okay that's fair enough next limper here cheating going large i like it king deuce facing a donk call that's so stupid that we can't see the sizing in that position. Yep, the deuce is pretty much a brick. I can start having a betting range that is built around like 9x plus. That wants to go big. And then we can use any sizing we want on the river. Like we can go all in on the river, for example. Yep, nice. Check 10. 3 bet. Fold to 4 bet important. Against pretty much anyone. I think it's suited. Not necessarily range bet board. But against most players on those stakes, it should work out. And here, I mean, it's a pretty much anyone. King-8 suited, not necessarily range bet board but against most players on those stakes it should work out and here I mean it's a pretty clear check. A small bet would not hurt too much and here yeah okay. Pocket aces take it. 8-6 suited against min-3 but that's a good table you're playing here. 5-6 suited. King-jack offsuit. This is half-pot bet. Okay, I like it. Queen-jack. We could size up here a little as well. Our 7s, 8s, 9s, 10s want to do that. Small bet is fine as well. Okay, so not too interesting from the button. Only raise and takes. So let's go to the small one then. Okay, let's see. Pocket kings, open raise, 4 race four bet and this can be small bet or an open jam i prefer the small bet just like people mess up more against that here and now let's solve that i think it can be another small bet or a check obviously yeah that card sucks smaller versus big blind i think we can block that again i like ace is so strong for us we could even size down if if we want. Size down even further. Jack of hearts, broke diamonds. Let's just see. This is just those boards where we have king, queen offsuit. We have ace, queen. We have ace, king as like hands that we have in our four betting range. This is why we have a jamming range here with 1.5x pot left. We do not have many hands that can bet fold. Just imagine you swatter here. Villain jams on you and then you sit there with like king queen ace queen ace king you are priced in this is why you jam yourself in spots like that and you can build a range around like less vulnerable hands and super bullshit right you can see that small with ace five suited you can see that small with pocket jacks and then like kings aces is kind of like kings is in between i think queens mainly want to go bigger ace jack king jack definitely want to go bigger so let's just have a look so here this is what we see blind versus blind the all-ins ace queen ace jack ace king pocket kings being indifferent actually between the half pot and the jam that makes sense yeah that this is better than the quarter yeah and then the small bets are just around like sets like invulnerable stuff and this full that can easily bet fold so if we do that which we should almost never do and then get the ace of diamonds we shouldn't have kings but if we have it we can actually like here that 10 with exactly that hand let me show that or we can check that's cool check and yeah against that this is okay right this jam is just showing that he doesn't know. Like in position, not playing those two streets in such an ugly spot is just jamming it in, making life easy for you. Your kings are indifferent. I think in the real world, they are just a fold. And yeah. Okay, here, blind versus blind, three bad pot. Okay, check, check. Oh, damn it. Yeah. Not even even like this guy can you mark him as a fish please i mean like he is not value betting anything okay nice hand queen jake suited with three bet c bet small here i think that works against lots of players but with a tiny bet yeah why not facing that race now is something where we need to find out how we play back, right? He is risking 8 to win 24. If we just fold all the time, we don't have anything. That's some trouble, but this hand is a fine fold. Okay, Ace, Queen, 3-bet, large-ish, like half pot-ish size. Fine. 3-axe heads up, okay. Ace-8 I think is too strong to check back here. Well range should be built heads up around weaker ace x i'm not 100 sure i'm not 3xing there and if i check that back like i'm freaking blasting here i have the super nuts and i value betting the river as well like yeah this is someone who doesn't play lots of heads up you have the freaking super nuts on the turn all you get is like a half pot bet and that freaking three on the river doesn't hurt you too much actually so some misvalue but that's that's about it king jack check call fine check check no one's value betting here jack yeah not a range bet board necessarily but this hand definitely fine all right which just giving up five of clubs. That's important and build some kind of checking range. This is a clear turn check, winning against all kinds of ace highs and a clear fold. Four, six suited. Almost range bet board. This hand definitely wants to go a little crazy. I mean, it's the worst hand we can have on the turn, but at the same time, it's the best turn we can have. So I think I'm checking and bluffing river, but putting out a block bet, I wouldn't hate nice do you have that board now i want to see that's like both is credible that i check like a good 10 or a weak jack here then block bet it on the river or that i just keep going with everything i'm having i think that that both makes sense and i personally like my instincts tell me it's like okay i go with like zero zero zero equity i check here and let me see where it's blind versus blind i should find something like a jack ten board hopefully this year jack ten four rainbow okay let's pretend we have five six of clubs now this is range bet board boom paul turn is the offsuit queen so we can bet a lot and our like nothing no nothing nothing prefers to check now. Five, six of clubs. Still has some maybe check, check. River is any card. Deuce. And then we have a pretty, pretty straightforward bluff here. Yeah, not a big deal. Both fine. Yeah, it's not a range check for it. We can definitely bet something like seven deuce not being connected. Betting this ace deuce is cool. Turn check. And now my theory wants to check call because we want to play it like ace highs i don't hate block like against this guy especially i don't know i mean he's not value betting anything either is he bluffing at all like it feels like on anal 100 i want to block bet myself to just get ace high calls because i don't see people bluffing maybe just an idea just an idea how we can deviate here okay that was it for the small blind that seemed pretty fine i only yeah didn't write down anything here. Just forget the heads up hand here. Like that ace eight is like, that was not good. Okay, and then some big blinds. 10 out of clubs, okay. Mainly call, we're check raising more through the weaker stuff. Frequency wise, we can put it in sometimes. And yeah, that seems fine. Looking at that, how often 10-9 suited is a three bet right we're falling out so much like king 10 king 9 offsuit that is a great effect probably missed a very high frequency three bet here in position okay i just write it down because this is a spot i definitely want to be on the gas here jack 7-3-4 i'm not sure whether i want to polarize here on the turn i want to bet all kinds of things we can split here but like the problem is that the four is so good for us that it gives incentive to villain to check very strong hands so he's uncapped which would mean an overbet is not really what i want to use i start splitting the river if you just check false the turn over betting turn and then the full brick sizing down. Like your story just doesn't check out at all. Like I'm not sure which hand whatsoever you're representing here. There's not even a flush draw that you wanted to max charge with your queen jack or so on the turn. So yeah like I'm not sure. This is a little... let me see whether I have something like that. Unfortunately not rainbow. we can take jack six three rainbow here to have a look I mean now you don't have the gut shot which kind of sucks so it's a little different but anyways right villain that small we call turn is a very good card for in position but it is rainbow it's a four so he checks and here this is what we see right there's no freaking over betting happening because on that that four villain is incentivized to check very very strong right seven five goes into a check pocket jacks go into a check sometimes the sets go into checks just in theory right here you're polarizing representing one specific thing where what do you want to represent i don't know and then you represent something else on the river and he calls you down with full shit actually i'm pretty sure if you size smaller on the turn you get that through it's like you're representing something I don't know and then you represent something else on the river and he calls you down with full shit Actually, i'm pretty sure if you size smaller on the turn you get that through it's like you're representing something I don't know something strong and then that makes this for a good blocker like that story doesn't check out weird story Sizing wise maybe use one size only before the river. That's always a cool idea, right? If I say okay on that board i'm stabbing small or i'm stabbing half or whatever and that one size fits all trade-off is a good one then we cannot get into this this mess up spot okay in theory we could donk here on boards like that multiway and here i think how much is in the middle and i mean we clearly plan to jam on the turn i go more like 2e right if he calls now we have 30 in the middle and he has like 30 29 left so you have like pot size on the turn and this is like far away from being pot size so I don't see a reason for that pattern we just want to stack his pocket eights pocket nines pocket tens yeah if we are sure they are jamming anyways that's cool yeah it doesn't make sense to have like that super small sizing there against his like I mean he flats in position. He has pocket eights, pocket nines, pocket tens. If he has a fish with all kinds of these hands, which it seems like, I don't mind, but your hand especially, like I wouldn't mind with eight six, but your hand especially is one that is not on the flop, but not on a lot of turns, right? Any six, eight, three card kind of kills your strength. So I want to rather get the money in now okay calling a four bet this is very very close to zero ev once he doesn't have enough bluffs which means he has a lot of over pairs your hand is a clearly minus cv just to keep that in mind i need a reason to find that call it's not standard just because the chart says it you play well against his bluffs you play well against ace jack off against king queen off against king nine suited but you don't play well against jack's queens kings and aces so you need to find the right ratio there where people have those hands a lot that you play well against why this is your board now such a great turn card he sits on like random ace kings ace queens whatever with the spade that he doesn't really start bluffing but yeah you have all kinds of potential bluffs this is just a very very mandatory bet here and yeah now making up for it playing against ace king like yeah no no no no no no okay let's let's solve that one maybe i'm wrong in the solar world but my heart is bleeding button versus big blind for a bad pot aye aye aye aye we have value sir and it's not like if you check your ace queen of spades here because you block the world that's fine but he might just sit on like ace of clubs king of spades that did or like something like that that didn't see that flop to not get check raise of their king of spades equity and this is what you need to charge here well there's plenty of reason to catch you can have queen jack suited queen 10 suited jack 10 suited and so on queen 10 offsuit float small bet shouldn't exist maybe it's a tell here on that board here i don't understand the small bet really like it's a good card for him in theory he should barrel a lot when he checks he rather represents like a nine or a three or a deuce that we want to attack so again i would go like half quarter or three quarters and now over bet like you are playing hell of a fancy thing here. Like, instead of just taking two normal bets and represent the world, you go like small representing weak to now like representing the river straight. I don't know. Yeah, whoa, he has a three. He bet small on the flop, checks on the turn. I mean, yeah, maybe you made him call here now by not representing anything again. But I don't understand the small turn bet bet to be honest. Let's first double check on that 983, right? So we obviously check. Villain's check back range is this ace-king type of hands with spade, without spade. Clubs want to check the most apparently, okay? Ace-queens, king-jack, whatsoever. Check, check, turn was the five of spades and we have the six-seven here. Yeah, I just want to bet all the time just this check here villain needs to like it's so like wild in a four bad pot like that people check back and then start bluffing with their king queen of nothing here that they start bluffing their ace king now on the turn their ace 10 i just i like betting myself and yeah let's say check check river was like a jack or something we're now going for the gems obviously not a mistake but it's like i like whenever it's value i want to dictate the size of the pot myself like every time in those things we're like your sizing patterns see a big blind in position two times i both didn't like um and the four bad pot um being tricky there when someone checks back is people like calling way more than they like bluffing So three bad pot heads up again. Okay I think you can almost range bet that board heads up because villain has all the offsuit broadways and they don't hit That check check another check What? It's like I mean I see that I mean you really are probably not a heads- player, but I look at that board and I have the nuts. I'm ready to go all in here. I bet like three quarters or something like that. We can bet small as well. Then if it goes check, check, I'm like blasting it here on the turn. If he bets small here, I'm value check raising. And on that 10, like if I'm in his shoes, I have the easiest value bet of all times with pocket sevens. This is wild, won't comment on heads up hands here too much because that's that's not the point here it's just something maybe you should skip the heads up a little or or like dive a little deeper into that those two hands were not good queen 10 here sometimes a three bet sometimes not so good to see it happen half pot is a fine sizing on that board having hearts makes it a probably good double barrel yeah not not being scared of check jam so i go with my equity hands to barrel super cool squeeze fold i'm so happy to see that fold okay king it off already close to defend here but yeah larger size doesn't exist on that board which means he has it or most likely has it okay i've seen you use the half pot a lot on like this type of board or like you had you had like something slightly less than half so now you're cheating with those queens which first of all i like but i just want to say i hope you are aware of it that like whether you only use that size or half pot or you want to cheat on on purpose and when you just have it because they have like inelastic calling ranges okay queen jack nine the board you can bet a lot on i think we have yeah it's a mix we can bet we can check everything is fine and now i actually like that fold this is already close like what are we hoping for not a queen 10 maybe the The three jacks that are not a diamond and have no implants. I think against half pot with an uncapped range behind. With that stack death, we can actually just fold. Yeah, I think we can just fold actually. I mean, it's close. It's seven of clubs. i think this is a little strong to start but the clubs are a little tempting i mean i have ace deuce ace three ace five that start before that ace seven just wants to go get your showdown so badly and not face the check race that's maybe wrong hand selection here actually see jack eight four i've seen so many jack x suited boards let-7-4, I think that's the closest. Jack-7-4, and then we have Ace-6 of backdoor maybe. Check, and we have Ace-6 of backdoor. We see the Jack-7-4 here, a villain checks to us, and we have the Ace-6 of backdoor or the Ace-8 of backdoor. It's just a very clear check. Yeah, I didn't offer half pot, but it's like in between those two. The check raise hurts hurts so much and it's actually a hand that doesn't benefit a lot from from betting so maybe just the wrong hand selection but besides that i like random stabbing on that board without the backdoor flush draw we can actually fold that right away okay what happened here yeah I mean if this guy is a fish we can cold call. Nice. This fold is important against half-court right away. Queen-9 suited. Cold call okay with a fish. I'm block betting all day long myself. Like I'm blocking all the Jack-X, Ace-X, 10-X, 9 x 9 x I don't want to like use this hand to bluff catch like what is he bluffing maybe he value bets worse we have folding okay nah this is a clear block bet min bet here no money went in the middle so far he can sit on a 10 he can sit on an ace he can sit on anything he's value betting the same hand for sure i prefer the block next best is call next best is fold raise is not good okay jack eight this year is again missed potential big blind versus small blind three bet did the queen ten of hearts in between just mentioning that it's something we we forget often and yeah nice hand okay so here we go here's our list and now let's have a look at your stats again. Okay, so first of all, we see, let's go with win rates. Win rates, they really, really, really, really suck, especially early position, middle position. Cutoff seems then okay and button is shit again. So early position and middle position, what does that fit to maybe? All three bet out of position. This year you knew about this one. this one three red pot take passive line this is both red line and maybe those positions through an in position call incredible price with low pocket is burning money maybe floating in this spot right so it's like the three bet pot in and out of position here and that's it pretty much okay so this can be a small explanation for that we didn't actually see too many of the standard hands we open big blind defense so i would like to see a little more there in theory or to take a deeper look here where like there must be money missing you must be open raising someone calls and you have to play that that board well but yeah so let's keep going raise first in seems absolutely reasonable small blind and button like slightly too much in theory but i like that three bad pre-flop 10.68 seems rather normal maybe we can have a look at positional mp actually like on this rather tight side cut off slightly tight maybe we can loosen up here slightly just because people as you are not for betting enough three bad success the pre-fall and fall i don't never understand that went to showdown very very low which is includes lots of folding where yeah like the pocket sevens come to mind but that was weird one at showdown so you really make sure to win at one showdown 68 in the small blind okay this is insane let's see i'm not sure went to showdown 26 one showdown 57 one dollar went seen flop 45 this is this big point somehow that where is it button cut off mp like you i just gotta double check yours i'll sort it the other way around button cut off mpep button cut off mpep my numbers are way higher than that it's like are you putting enough pressure on people from early position from middle position or what we can see as well that we wrote down hey i get too often in bad situations right this is only one dollar one seed flop if you fold your pocket fives pre-flop and your seven six suited pre-flop and your you four bet your king ten suited you put yourself into better positions where you win the pot more often post-flop instead of seeing a flop check calling check folding check calling check folding not going for the check raises that you could go for sometimes. This is probably a big point to just put yourself in the like positions that are likelier to win the hand, right? Represent the stronger ranges in the end. C-bet flop, whatever, c-bet flop success, check raise total, very, very low. We have seen the three bet pot out of position. I don't know. I guess you work on the blind versus blind and big blind versus something we didn't have any hands regarding that really sorry total check raise flop no that makes it better 11.2 is a different world than 9.4 and then turn river can be less that's that's actually okay see that turn is incredibly low oh wow 37 you should get the 40 somewhere so maybe like that queen jack find some more of those right hands that you can double barrel instead of checking back and then folding to a river bet especially like bluffs that have something good going for them right i mean that we did have a couple of sessions that betting big and polar i think is a great session with those little boxes and ideas which hand categories we want to have within our double barreling range to just get that number up. cbet turn success call river efficiency okay so yeah this is like actually this call river efficiency is too high it seems like you are really folding the world which i like in most spots but not something like the pocket sevens or like the jack nine heads up where you fold hands that actually beat value that probably you should have bet in the first place. fold to preflop five bet, this shows very very clearly that you're not bluff 4 betting at all, which is something in those linear positions like cutoff like MP is actually a good thing to be doing. Yeah, fold to preflop 5 bet, just this shows me clearly that you're never 4 betting your ace 10 suited, king 10 suited here and the problem is that you're instead calling which puts you in like a bad red line position. This makes you red line actually like starting to 4 bet here. 4 bet preflop, yeah, like small bind, Like you're not calling which puts you in like a bad red line position this makes you red line actually like starting to four bet here four bet pre-flop yeah like small bind like you're not even value betting against the big blind value for betting that's a little wild so this i guess is the very very clear explanation of the red line maybe missing a little aggression on the turn clearly putting your like i don't want to say missing aggression but clearly putting yourself in the wrong spots there, being this out of position caller all the time. And then obviously big, big, big topic was those like sizings that actually did not really make sense. Like big blind versus small blind, what you were repping, where I think one big piece of advice would be to just cut it down to one sizing until the river that you want to use for your range. And then make the hands fit in there because this really looked like you make up a story in your mind and then change the story between turn and river where yeah it's like yeah it's fucking up villain as well but in the end it just doesn't make sense yeah i hope you guys enjoyed that and found something that is for you interesting as well and yeah thanks for the hands mr geduld bitte and yeah i hope you enjoyed that until the next one have a good one
