### TOPIC: cash hand review 12
 Here we go. We got the first one in here. Michaud. Hey, Michaud. Everyone feel free to say hi in the chat. First people should be coming in here. So far you see, hopefully, our two faces. Like, Jeroen just chilling in the, like, some kind of oasis in the desert, it looks like. Yeah. I'm in my... Who the fuck actually did that random cap on my stars trophy here in the back? And actually, what you can see, like, this is what I do more at the moment. Like, some kind of laundry making here in the office. So like one of my jobs as well so let's see i'm trying to find the loom and your document this is here on the side and then i'll share my screen as well four people we need more people dj hey dj hey johanna hey eli Where do you see how many people? Oh, there. On the right. There are three participants and we are the two panelists. Hi, SÃ¶ren. Hey, Sue. Hi, guys. Glad you all made it. So something about you. Jeroen is like, I know one Jeroen and he's Dutch. You seem to, like, since you don't speak German and you, like, maybe I hear a slight French accent, I would guess like Belgium, but I don no it's just Dutch yeah it's just Dutch okay yeah but not close to the German border no one forced you to learn our crazy language I studied for five years I think in high school so there's some German make sure to not give him too much shit in the chat that's what I'm here for exactly okay you did the linking with the hands i'm glad to read that so as always i'm just waiting like three minutes or so for some people to come in to not like repeat everything five times what we are doing but i'm really i hope you can hear it a little i'm super tired that's what i hope you don't hear but i'm really thrilled for that session because it's pretty cool hey kai hey pavel josh fabi looks good some more to your background what's your typical schedule what are you playing like what stage oh yeah yeah I talked in the loom a little bit about it so I mainly play live played live full-time for two years then did my masters and now I'm playing full-time again but it's a bit on the edge of like being enough or not being enough so and definitely online like so i played like 100 now regular tables some months ago and then played a lot live again so now just switched back to you know lower stakes like 25 now and 50 now to just get into the online again so like one midterm goal would be like the same for many of us to just like move up to something like nl 200 games to like be a little have like a healthy win rate to get like really another hourly going compared to those lower stakes well actually like one good thing that i can take ahead here is like that this is like from your thought process and what i've just like felt and heard so far just like it's absolutely possible to actually like just clicking one button like to like as you said like you have those play fine think about tough stuff tough stuff like we're really tough stuff just means it doesn't matter in the end because your thought process is right and if we think about like making zero point something ev here or not doing it there then we are already at a certain stage this is what i felt but obviously if we punt 100 big blinds every now and then right i always have 100 big blinds punting it once every thousand hands is changing the win rate by 10 big blinds so everyone can do the math and this is like from maybe playing minus three to plus seven it's like yeah obviously every punt is not worth minus 100 big blinds just like we can make crazy bluffs and still have fold equity but actually some of your punts were worth about 100 big blinds i'm pretty sure of that so it's kind of fun there wow sounds like you yeah so i think it's actually really really really yeah good hand selections by you because lots of people can hopefully refer to that it's something that yeah like the main thing maybe we get to your goals that you presented like how we end up the session as well or what we try to achieve is that lots of people get stuck actually in things that do not matter just like maybe you hear it in all my live videos so that i have a very clear picture of just no way okay here it doesn't matter here it's just a small spot we can do this or that while then like doing something super crazy out of line in like the big big spots where actually not messing up would just be the thing right it's like i make fun of those zoom 200 players those regulars where all they do is just like not messing up right they are a little too nitty that doesn't cost them too much money but like they are not lighting money on fire, which, well, you did sometimes. Love the selection. Super interesting stuff and that you are not afraid to discuss. Yeah, big shout out to him to show the puns. That's the first thing. We are here to get better. There are lots of people who share stuff to only look good, right? Obviously you look great here in the picture. That's for sure. But I mean, some hands maybe do not look great. And yeah, I'll get a feeling for how much shit I can give you for it. I try to start on the peak level and then see where we end up with. Very curious. I thought you were so excited about that. I thought like, okay, we're getting there. Yeah, sure. All right. So I mean, you have seen my comments already. I guess let's get things started. Just reading over it. I'm sharing my screen. Let's try to find the right one. Oh, what is here? Oh, Poker Co. This is a good site you could check out every now and then okay let's see all right so we have something goals for the session hand review see in which way and how much to deviate from the solver so actually i just wrote privately with jerome i just told him like what you gave me as like pinpoints here was actually what i just built yesterday in my head actually i talked to talked to some of the grindhouse guys I met yesterday, like actually about the coaching. So I hope maybe some of them, they probably are totally wasted by now, but yeah, maybe some of them will tune in a little later. And this is pretty much the idea that I rank a little. We are, are we in the solver world? I have actually in my sheet that I made, I can tell you already, where is it here? You can already see a little ahead, but there in the end that I made I can tell you already where is it here you can already see a little ahead but there in the end I have like two things that I don't want to forget that actually answer some of the questions we're like I will pull out paint for all the paint lovers out there visualize your thought process that I felt like is there and where it was lacking and like I called filter picture I don't know whether this is an english word that breaks down a little when we narrow down ranges like you did something and we will see that that you like we have an information then we have the next information next information and this is how we narrow down ranges what you did every now and then was taking one information restarting the hand forgetting this information and start with the next one. We're like, just like maybe for example, the big blind three bet very smallish where we could know like, this is a fish already. We call all pocket peers. And then we go for the float where we could already say like, okay, it's a fish three betting from the big blind. It's like aces, kings, ace, king kind of thing where then, yes, then we play GTO on the flop again, but we did not really think about the first part but let's get to that a little later i don't want to have like too many people not having a clue what i'm talking about right now so this is definitely something we will look at pinpointing your worst tendencies there's one clear tendency that we will work at flaws in my general approach we'll see but probably see, but probably not too many, like some small stuff where there's just room for improvement. There's something that you might have never seen before, how a game tree works in like certain spots. Floss in my reasoning to make puns, that's the same like the tendencies. There's one big tendency that just is actually every single one of the puns was the same punt in my eyes. Discussing how to best work i would say discussing how to get better quickly actually because your game is pretty good so this is a little outlook and now i guess let's start sounds promising i want to have the chat on the side we're already here we're only at 5 a.m so yeah got some more beers in okay solid thursday night and this is gonna be your roast by the way you can top it up a notch i think i can sorry say it again if this is gonna be your roast level you can top it up a notch i think yeah yeah no worries no worries i'm like super nice so far okay so i hope you don't hear the sound there when i click on it i'm looking for the timestamps here we go i just go like step by step with how i started them and. And then I talked to Jerome in the beginning, just like he will interrupt me when he sees we run out of time to definitely hit the most important ones as well. But I will try to mention as well when something's really not important to not lose like all the time in some bullshit detail. But the first 10, I will definitely have a look at because yeah, there's actually one mistake that I think, or it might be a mistake and that is overlooked very, very quickly. So just a quick rundown of the hand. We're not listening to you here again, because some people have watched it already and I have watched it. So what is happening here is we three bet ace king from the small blind, the button flats. See, is there actually the option to like move a little ahead sometimes? can't skip the five seconds i had down there the five yeah the five right maybe i make it even bigger it's better so we go for a small range bet which i think is pretty standard and yeah as always just feel free to interrupt me in the chat write something there ask questions and so on and now your own first challenge for you tell me your turn strategy with your range not with your hand where are our advantages which sizings are we using how much are we betting more or less just a little breakdown yeah well actually i have to admit like i looked this one up before i made the loom already so i kind of saw this one as well so i suppose like our range should be more about the like kings queens jacks type of hands where we have the advantage which button doesn't have so i didn't think about that in game but i think because the ace is paired i think that's a way bigger factor than if it's just like a6 deuce or something so yeah i definitely did not think about that in game and I would not think about that too quickly, I think. Absolutely. It's one of those big spots where blockers matter so much, right? Just think about it. If we have a bluff, villain has like an ace, like double as often, right? If we have the ace, he pretty much never has an ace or like just 50% of the time compared to the one where we have a bluff. So it's something where, yeah, maybe check out on the platform. We did a little toy game there in like one of the first videos actually, where I built something where this is exactly what you can see that like, okay, if I have it, it's like very unlikely that villain has it as well. And the other way around. And how do we find like the right way to like tackle villain, right? Because it's like, okay, if we bluff all the way through here with our, sure, we can bet big with a flush draw, then he calls down his ace-axe and is maybe just slightly overfolding. Maybe it would be working for like 150 bigs that villain actually only needs to call down ace-axe. It's kind of that trap that we think like, yeah, let's bet, bet, bet to get it in against something like ace-5. Like we should find all kinds of ways to get the money in against other tricks. So it's really, where's our other advantage? And it is, as you said, kings, queens, jacks, and they want to do something else, right? They want to tackle villains, nines, eights, sevens, king high floats, and so on. We can check here. We can bet small here. It's actually what I was referring to, Pa referring to was not the dice principle it was the ace king queen i'm not really focusing just on the ace i'm just saying against the ace we get it in no matter what we can check check again check jam whatever right so something like that and now actually i pulled out because i want to show that to you this is a game tree that lots of players play wrong and now not only that we want to play that correctly but even more that we understand what people are doing wrong right that like if people are betting here big they just always have it right we don't need to call down anything and if they bet small well it's very very likely that they just have exactly the hand they represent and we can go pretty crazy after them for example that this is just a pattern that people just mess up and this is the reason because it's very very natural to just take that ace king and bet big where my comment to that hand was actually the one for everyone who tried to link was the gto-ish but likely misplaying turn completely just like not using that sizing i'm just working on it to find the right sims we have the ace ace two sport that i definitely have in here because ace king especially with the king of diamonds we see the range that first is actually the one hand that is fine betting a little bigger right so it's definitely not like a mistake but the whole pattern is like yeah we check a lot we just check check check a lot our advantage is like here we can bet small we can check and like one of our game trees is definitely what do we do with queens like check check we like it river brick kind of we get like a normal bet in kings jacks the block bet tens nines eights and maybe this is the same thing we want to be doing with ace queen so we could ask ourselves yeah our competition is definitely not doing that so there's like let's call it as it is like a fucked up game tree everyone misplays so there's lots of room for exploits would we like a 10 turn c bet here no we need to attack peers maybe we can have tiny bets on like a king or a queen when really his peers are worth way way way less but we have more value than 10 percent bet check jam would it not blow off future potential we are not check jamming we are trying to get directional in over three streets but put that ace king into a range that makes sense for us instead of well we're splitting range go directional in with ace king ace queen is what lots of people are doing and then check all the other stuff and actually they are way too weak then that's a little little the risk but yeah actually this is something right i don't want to go into detail too much here because obviously we could make like a 30 minute lesson about how to proceed on the turn on pierre board it's in a three-bet pot but that's not the goal of the session so this is the first mess up and then here i loved I loved all your reasoning, right? The river is the jack of diamonds. Your hand is still partly GTO on the turn. So it's like the solver can tell us what to do. Your reasoning was here that, hey, actually it's like very, very tough. That villain doesn't have anything, right? Obviously he has weaker ace-axe. And I think we have a clear block bet against that. Jamming would definitely be overdoing it. Because villain just has, there's one ace left. It's the freaking ace of diamonds. And off-suit combos villain has is like, okay, ace-queen, but then it's ace-jack, which is a boat. And then it starts that villain only has it suited pretty much, which is just not many combinations while we run into all flushes of the world. Which we can look up as well. If big here six of diamonds we bet big now this was probably too big what's the that's the sizing he uses so let's take this one represent jack of diamonds and we actually see like this mix between actually it's just a check it's so weak it's like indifferent between check or bet where some comments in the chat in the discord even said like i would just jam because he can call ace queen we're like we're seeing that a jam loses 50 bucks but if you have the ace of diamonds it's losing less but it's still shit villain can just fold everything right it's like you broke down his range to like ace x pretty much on the turn already and flush draws now one of the main ace x gets you with the jack and the flush draws get you like your hand is not worth a lot we are playing a 408 pot right now probably a little too small for you to see and we have value of like 170 so kind of like definitely not a value bet really and once we check and villain jams i like the thought process a lot right you thought about okay what might be gto how do things look like and then even said like okay what we're bluff catching right? You thought about, okay, what might be GTO? How do things look like? And then even said like, okay, what, we're bluff catching situation. Well, you thought about what does villain need to bluff to make that a plus EV catch, right? And you came up with that sevens, eights, nines, that he needs to double float first, or I would say like super unlikely, and then bluff it instead of hoping to win sometimes. We're like, okay, if we check here and villain j the king of diamonds because of that blocker we win 15 out of 750 a villain plays perfectly right ace king without diamonds is just losing so yeah i love those type of folds just saying okay this is the bluffs he needs to find i know there's no way they find it because either they fold the turn or they do not jam the river or like do not do it on that frequency so here this is the hand that maybe the turn play aside was discussed on a level that i could discuss with like one of my buddies just like playing the hand on 5k versus someone right it's just okay we know more or less the game tree we play like the solver and then talk about those little things, like do we make a zero EV catch or a $15 EV catch or not? And actually the $15, because I always add a zero, is actually $1.50. So just maybe put that into perspective. And yeah, so it's really a high level hand to discuss where we can learn, hey, write it down, double check game trees. How does it look like on king-king deuce on the turn game trees how does it look like on king king deuce on the turn how does it look like on queen queen deuce like those feelings that we always have like we have aces on queen queen deuce we have kings on queen queen deuce where do we start checking or block betting because just going for stacks means we are running into trips all the time so it's like but this is how i try to learn from those hands we create a problem we made a slight mistake or didn't know something and now we learn something new and it's like, but this is how I try to learn from those hands. We create a problem. We made a slight mistake or didn't know something. And now we learn something new and it's way better to remember that. And this tiny discussion here, this is like really the high level where this is not where you win or lose the money, right? We can say that already. We're like, you can forget about those. You can say on your stakes, realizing this is more or less a zero EV catcher. So you're just folding it every single time. That would totally do the so yeah off to the next one i would say all right okay and you said the timing tail thing is really not important i didn't listen to that what was that about oh no i said like i thanked my old time bank empty on the river i thought you said something about timing it doesn't make a big difference you tell villain that you really have a decision or you just took your time to go to the restroom okay obviously you shouldn't have timing tails but just on big river decisions for stacks just always taking 20 seconds cannot hurt right the full-time bank okay this sometimes happens but it's like how easy is it for you to read into someone taking it full-time back do we actually look to to go directional in on any runouts? Or is that a mistake to think like that on the flop? Maybe you misunderstood me there. I want to go directional in, but the way directional in is not necessarily bet, bet, bet. So I'm thinking about what is villain betting? Can I check race here? Or can I check, check, and then check jam or something like that? Maybe I can show that to you as well. That if we take that line, we we block bet the turn let's say we do that with ace king or with ace queen the block but the turn river is like a perfect card for us like even a king then it's just like we are going with the dice principle right we try to fit everything together where he actually ace king we are block betting because villains should raise every ace where i would be the first that would be happy to overrule that because people are not necessarily raising their ace five here so i would be happy to just go all in to just do the job myself this is like something that we can manipulate a little us having so much kings queens jacks tens this is our advantage just gives us very very different incentives to like play away and we want to have ace king in the same way we could look at that here as well equity right it's like on the top end we are doing okay we have a little more ace king but actually this is all the ace x we don't have our advantage here our advantage is this bullshit here us having queens villain having eights us having jacks villain having king queen like this what we try to target. Maybe this explains things pretty well, that we try to achieve a point where we play our top 70% range versus villain's top 70% range. This is what we try to aim at. Instead of we have ace king, and now we want to stack his ace 10. We're like, this is what villain should take over. If we represent something like mean, he should take over and go directionally. Okay, I see already. Will will spend lots of time on a couple of hands, but let's see. You already tackled, I think, what we want to do in the ace-10 hand. Yeah, absolutely. Let's take that right away. Is that hand number three? Yeah, hand number three at the 9-0-7. Oh,7 so misha you check ace queen or worse can villain safely shove ace queen with the idea of folding you from a split he will never put you on ace king i mean it's just they should get the money in with ace queen because it's a freaking value crushing hand it's just everyone is a little too nitty there and we need to find out like, to not miss out that value with our value hands when we beat them and maybe design the game tree a little, right? Against people that are not aggressive. I'm totally fine with going big bet, bet, bet with ace king to just get the money in. It's absolutely fine. Just we want to do that while understanding that actually another game tree would make more sense, right? If villain is never bluff example on the river i can just block block block my kings and then fold every single time right this is just the freedom we are having okay case 10 let's move to the next hand hand number three okay i wrote down some things just reading through that so you explained a little against certain player type you go to like a bigger open race size can you maybe discuss that a little yeah sure so what i thought was like i'm now playing in the zoom like 25 and zoom 50 and i will and i feel like a lot of people are so nifty they really don't defend their blinds enough so when one of the two is like let's say the average is like below 20 or something as vpip i open to 2x and when they are above 20 or like i feel like they defend quite enough i go to 2.8 because i feel like people don't really adjust from 2.5 to 2.8 or whatever they just they kind of the same so i thought maybe they make some more mistakes there okay right have a clear reasoning. You want to make use of them over folding with having a wide min raising range against this player type and then going to a large race where like, actually, is it still correct for them to defend something like King nine off against 2.8 X? I don't even know. Right. So probably not, but people will still do if they have that right. As you said, not adjusting. So I like that. It's an idea. You can play different styles pre-flop. You can simplify. You can take a 3x. You can take whatever. Here's like, in theory, not an EV difference as long as everyone reacts correctly. But you can force them to play your game tree. So I like something like that a lot, especially when villains are potentially weaker. So now we went with a range bet on the flop, which is absolutely is absolutely fine obviously and now we have the first turn decision that you discussed and now with taking your knowledge from the last hand into play here what would you say here is the correct turn play so yeah ranges are a lot wider of course here than in the last example but i still think like going big and then big again would target like the same like trips again so yeah i think probably in theory go smaller kind of i think here in game you discuss whether you want to overbet or go normal right and the answer here is to definitely just go normal right overbet is just not a thing because this is the blocker issue again. Like which bluff do you want to overbet running into all kinds of ace-axe then? It's that blocker issue. When I have it, you can't have it. If I don't have it, you will have it. It's really that just think of a card game and one of you has the joker. Here there are two jokers in the deck. If you have none, well, okay. It's just like just like he will have one very very often so this is where we need to find the trade of sizing where we can attack something that has not the joker in it right so here obviously with ace 10 we don't want to go huge ever just because well i want to invite him to do something crazy right to like check raise his combo draw or just at least chase his flush draw that is drawing dead and so on i'm always betting like 75 percent here maybe against some players we can like sometimes check back as the full trap but again that is a road we would take if someone is ready to still put the whole stack in on the river which is just super unlikely if we are still playing a nine big blind pot, right? If I'm playing against Michael Adamo, if some of you are following the Triton games, who is just throwing around like five X overpats left and right. Yeah, this is the perfect guy to sometimes have the super nuts as a trap. Let him hit something. Let him hit his freaking seven nine with a nine of hearts that he floated on the flop and then hit his six. And then he just goes all the way because he thinks we're capped and actually we are not well that would be great but in all those player pools right check makes so much sense like people's minds because trapping feels cool but we are playing freaking 25 nl 50 nl like people are chasing their hands they call they are they are not aggressive so we definitely need to build the pot here and i think the check would be a big big big mistake well let's just see how much that gets proven by the solver Thank you. They call there. They are not aggressive. So we definitely need to build the pot here. And I think the check would be a big, big, big mistake. Let's just see how much that gets proven by the solver. The range bet, I think, is nothing to discuss on that board. Villain calls. We could obviously look at what you should check raise. It's probably not happening like that. But it doesn't matter too much. And then on the turn, we just clearly see that overbet is not a thing. It's just not a thing. And this is the ace-axe issue, right? If the board was unpaired, if it's like ace-10-deuce and then the turn eight, then we go like 150% all day long. And here it's like ace-10 obviously is the first one that we could check back, right? Villain improves to something and then gets all the money in the middle. Let's have a look at that game tree. Let's get a nine out there. And what should happen is like, villain block bets. We raise small. Villain should go over the top with queen jack. Villain should go over the top with something like 10-9. Villain should sometimes bluff something. And so on and so on. Is that happening? I don't think so. This is why I like to take control of the pot size always myself. But the only sizing that is an option for us is the 75% one. Willem calls and then we have a river. And here I want to ask you as well, seven of hearts. So you did end up betting 75% or 66%, something like that, like a sizing which I like a lot and then seven of hearts what was your play what do you think is the best play and what would you do if you can play the hand again yeah so my thinking was like okay flushes should raise now so probably just size down a little bit again just taking a normal size and I was debating like jamming because i thought i'm not sure if that really happens and yeah i think like in hindsight i think like i can probably best just jam and just see if he can call or not like he probably calls a lot of stuff that he doesn't raise like if i just bet small and he doesn't raise i just lose so much whereas if i just jam they might even call i think it's a very very tough spot especially like more amateur or like not very experienced people see like that i try to induce now where like if someone bets in position on that board where i have everything like i just revert all the flushes and he like no one ever is going for thinnest of all values, just like throwing another 30% bet out there because they are scared of the check race. That's the most nutted things because I'm just like reading it. The 30% that can work versus crazy maniacs, right? Great read. A reason to bet smaller is exactly to play it, like referring to the ace-ace-deuce, to play it like the other part of our range that actually cannot go big enough right what do we do with ace king ace queen ace jack they still have value against weaker ace x but actually they run into some boats and they run into some flushes so just like betting pot doesn't work checking back seems too weak so we can actually use a smaller size and then should include this year. But now again, we are on NL 25. And I would say that like we have some kind of like inelastic calling range here that no matter our sizing up to a certain point, when villain has a flush, I don't think people are check raising a random flush here against the 75% bet. So I just didn't agree on what you said in- game. I mean, they shouldn't. That's the main point. Maybe they are. I wouldn't agree, but that's guessing, but I'm sure no one folds a river flush up to like two times pot. Like it's just definitely not happening. So there's a certain line, which is like a value we get for sure against the range part villain has for sure. And obviously villain will still jam his boats. Like we don't lose any value to that so if you think about that if you bet like 30 percent how much action villain needs to do to make up for that right where we can look at the sim and we see that in theory our ace 10 wants to bet exactly that i offered 50 as the smallest i'm not going smaller than 50 in spots like that and i offered 75 we already see that this is what ace king wants to do and it's like yeah it's a clear value bet but like winning five dollars more it's like already on the thin side and then ace 10 wants to do the same thing obviously to then this is what should happen right actually the king high flushes are not even raising so once villain is doing that it's a massive overplay and actually what villain should be doing is bluffing with ace x like this is where our money comes from which is like okay yeah villain i mean he's jamming ace eight and a seven and ace five and ace four are his bluffs so you already see it if we take that line definitely not the same money like from the solver will go in the middle. So it's like villain should jam his ace five and then we fold our ace queen. Like, no, it's not happening. So I actually would love a huge sizing and then it's kind of a guessing game which sizing is the best. It's just, if I bet 150%, villain in theory is indifferent with king high flush, but I know he calls every flush that he has. So I know there's a clear mistake. No one ever folds his river King high flush here against 150%. Can I stretch it to 200%, to 250? I don't know. So this would be my reasoning where I say like, this is clear dice principle, river game. I think about what is the next worst hand? Where is my value coming from? And I maximize against that. Going small maximizes value at the same time against his crazy check raise river bluffs that we can discount almost 100%, I would say. So yes, some people have their 10-8 and they take that to check raise. That's fine, right? But that's about it. Yeah, actually hand, you played a GTO. What did I did i write down there gto-ish but likely messing up with bluffs that's something i added that they always take the hands that want to bet those 50 or like smaller sizing on the river but the bluffs just click the next hotkey that we used before when i face that bet it's either super nuts or it's like exactly the hand they wrap like ace queen something like that here is like my read playing against that where obviously no one in l25 and l50 thinks about that necessarily or just doesn't have the experience okay any questions to that hand yeah i think actually the main thing i really up there is like thinking a flush should raise for him and yeah that clearly was not the case so then i think it's just like missing a lot of value by not going like mainly the answer always is like okay just build the pot yourself because they are not doing it so i think that really applies here then as well okay i write that down for later because this is definitely part of our summary build the pot yourself when you have it right it's like don't rely on they bluff this they do this whatever like they are not but they are calling right they are not like when they hit something on the river they are definitely not folding they fold when they show weakness so yeah then let's get to the next hand and some people might it's this jack seven of. And some people who have seen the loom might already have seen it. Hey, Damien. And maybe I want to ask that first to the chat. Whoever did the linking game, try to link this hand to my comments. You can participate as well, Jerome. What do you think was my comment fitting to this hand? I'll get you the flop that you know better as well. So it a flop that went check check here with jack seven of diamonds turn is an ace and we delay over bet and i wrote a comment down there i think it was one of the easiest to find out johanna is saying what the fuck super random lighting money on fire might be the case but it's actually not it's not the one i have the same ones it's in the red area you have a second try anyone else in the chat it's the what the fuck why or the why with the question mark i know that's more like the caps lock is used for like big spots for like big spots where we punt stacks turn sizing doesn't exist okay yes that might make sense but misha got it it's the absolute dog shit fancy play syndrome, right? Like why do we freaking start over betting at some point where actually we check back first. So absolute dog shit fancy play syndrome. Let's have a look and break it down because it's okay to do that. Like actually your reasoning, like people will do that. And then the turn, this is one of the parts where I think the overall strategy doesn't make sense but you are attacking weakness you're attacking weakness especially on the turn and this will end up in fold equity so it's not burning money this is maybe a logical mistake but not losing a single penny i would say right this is the big difference i had the dog shit for the queens yeah that's one of the what the fuck why it's like definitely cap slot the pocket definitely caps lock so nine five deuce ace and you even talked about the reasoning here which makes it better for me right you say like okay you expect people on that ace to mainly take over initiative with their pocket deuces with their fives with their three four suited and this is why you have strong aces you can overbet them to attack weak aces and all the peers there's a logic that made sense that's i guess if i remember correctly more or less what you said during that hand and i'm just saying well i'm pretty much checking range on that ace and i'm like check raising the shit out of you if i have my deuces 5-3-4 and this is the reason why big sizings are not really allowed for imposition because there's a rather high risk of getting check raised, which the solver agrees with. But if your guess is correct, then it's the absolute fine thing to adjust. But yeah, like would be something again, like the ace, ace, deuce for our little to-do list that I try to always have to get better in single individual spots it's just write down delayed game low trade off whatever board it's like what are the sizings how to play on high cards what to do on a six on the turn if he checks to us what to do on a four what if he block bets on a six what are the hands I'm raising it's like the whole understanding that delayed game tree that's this just shows just shows me, okay, probably we don't know this one, which is absolutely fine. And then we learn that and know at some point you're at 150% bet. So let's have a look at what the solver says. Yeah, I actually, because you did the probing video, right? So I thought I really remembered that one. Like, I'm not sure if I remember correctly, but I remember like people shoot 4X probe or something on that board often. I thought like, okay, that's like what people are never doing, but maybe they actually go more often with a check raise than with a probe of 4X. So then the adjustment is wrong probably. The thing is that like probing 4X or, I mean, it's just more like 2.4X, I guess, to get directional in, something like that. Or 3.2X, I'm in the wrong spot, but whatever. Or check raising, that's the brothers, right? Their goal is build a pot directional in. And whether you overbet now and make an ace indifferent or you check, let the ace bet first and make it indifferent then, it's kind of the same thing. It's like big blind making a statement. I have a set, I have a straight, and you not. So this is the main thing. And we can look at that pretty easily. I offered a half pot and I offered the over bet that we sometimes like on that board. Jack seven can do anything. Diamonds likes to invest less money, obviously. So we go for the check, check. It's super fine. Turn was flush draw, turn was flush draw right ace of hearts and this is what we see here 31 in the middle it's the 2.4 it's the 74 the only size that wants to be used this is directional and take our 3-4 50% of the time that house plus car key get a river brick and then jam 3-4 right and then villain sits there and yeah is indifferent with ace jack actually right and so it's like this is what's happening just saying i have it right but it's the same thing works the same way if you take your three four and you check villain is not really over betting like this will disappear if i keep the solver running but single race bots i was on the very very nitty side with running the solver so it should like bet normal maybe and then you do exactly the same thing right this is again the 2e sizing raising to 125 going all in on the river everything indifferent that's kind of what's happening and yeah so the main sizing we can have a look here jack 7 is a totally fine step we don't have anything going for us so usually staying on the lower side if you have like a flush draw or like you have the freaking queen four of hearts and over betting is not really a mistake because building a pot is fine but you have a hand that is not interested in building a pot but the card is so good that we can do something small sizing middle sizing this sizing mix is just because of i didn't run that long enough so if you want to run that a little longer it will be more one of the sizings which will be the normal one or like actually a little smaller than that maybe because this cannot be cool to take this sizing already make 9x indifferent i guess that's too early so maybe something like half pot would be better but doesn't change ev so again here right you did over bet bet villa needs to defend still some 9x this is what i meant with like you were not burning money this is fine if you want to go crazy and people are betting when they have it which might be absolutely true on some stakes then they are over folding and you make money maybe you make more money with the different sizing but it's not something where you lost your win rate or something you need to work at it's something on your little to-do list maybe look at that spot understand it better know your sizings know your game tree right we're like actually this part is way more interesting for me six of diamonds villain goes crazy block bets what are we raising are we raising jack seven of diamonds or not like how is villain playing and so on and play stuff like that correctly when we take over the initiative again. Yeah, the probing video, I think we discussed there a lot. And yeah, it's a cool hand to go a little crazy. I tried to explain why it doesn't make sense, but it can be the case that it's definitely not burning money. The river though will be burning money. There's like nothing up there. Willem can have like ace five. Willem can have ace 10, especially. So there are like some snap calls and we have nothing going for us. So on the turn, you attack weakness. On the river, you attack a range that is bluff catchers only. You get snap fold from king high flush draws and that's it. That's not much. So it's one of those spots. Like lots of you attended the paint coachings where it's just one of those spots where i would say we choose a sizing this is villain's range we choose a sizing where we need to make him fold like we can do the exact numbers we risk 92 to win 24 so this needs to work 92 through 116 this needs to work 80 of the time right so this is pretty much the orange is like 80 of this range and villain's range is a little structured like that he has like snap calls which is ace 10 and maybe some other two pairs then he has no snap folds only the king high flush draws that's on the right side that's folding for sure and in the middle there's like bluff catchers right so this is the nuts this is the bluff catchers and this is the snap folds let's say like san francisco snap folds here so you created a situation where you force the lunch just fold every single bluff catcher and if you find a villain who is like not believing all of a sudden or like yeah like 30 of his love catchers then you're burning money you found-reward spot that is just like not really promising while there's no chance that it's printing. Just villain has ace-10. So that's kind of my logic and the spot that I don't want to go for. And this is the pattern we will see a couple of times more a little later. And now somehow everything minimized. Yeah, when you put it like this, it seems really problematic. Johanna johanna we obviously made him fold right because we are great players and we sniffed it out the weakness and he ended up folding he followed ace 10 we're pretty sure about it okay so now let's let's do a very quick one ace jack offsuit you just ask that question you always hit your life range check board over cards, actually pretty strong. Not a backdoor. We have the ace of the backdoor. One suit, like just blocking the backdoor flush. I don't know whether that helps. But this is just easy to look at the solver to have a good feeling for it. I don't have 9-6-5. I don't run blind versus blind. But as you might know, I have quite some boards prepared for blind versus blind and we will find something similar not six five five but it's easier to find it like that let's take like a nine nine six four right it's a board that is actually better for the small blind because there's no like better than the nine six five because there's no straight yet and we see already okay this is a trade-off But if we check, and we check a lot with our ace-jack, no diamonds, and villain bets big. I offered 30% and 70%. Villain in-game did bet 66%. So that's very close. Our ace-jack, no diamond is just a crystal clear fold. But actually, the one with the jack of diamonds is already close then, right? Winning $1 out of a $52 pot. So if people are not bluffing enough, just folding our ace one with a jack of diamonds is already closed then right winning one dollar out of a 52 pot so if people are not bluffing enough just folding our ace jack with the jack of diamonds is totally fine as well that's the spot i'm not interested in and we want to let go give us the next spot that's not not ours and yeah quick quick hand quick hand yeah yeah we are at quite some minutes already like how long were you thinking for for this session i need to wrap up at four so we have like 90 minutes total so we're in like 45 minutes kind of with like first five minutes talk okay so i think maybe to just go quickly through some easy ones because we have the list here for everyone who's seen the loom or wants to watch it afterwards we have this check flop facing a bet all right this is where we are at right now clear fold we had the ones before then the second hand was a was a bluff catch there was like a button versus small band three bad pot it's a gto plus slightly winning bluff catch just because blockers it's a pure bluff catch it has positive blocking effects so it's just the situation is villain over bluffing or not in this very spot i don't want to pull it out now because it's actually not the most interesting one i would say it's likely that people are over bluffing and i would make that call quite often on all stakes but this is the evaluation i want to know it's like zero eb more or less and then it's just my decision which catchers do i want to call or not and yeah go with that go with like some reads i might have and now i want to know what villain had because i feel like you ended up calling yeah i i ended up calling and he showed jack 10 and i was kind of surprised it was like just the the top here almost no kicker right yeah i thought like okay so i feel like i'm almost always folding like in this spot but here i thought like with these blockers and stuff i thought like same as you like probably they have some a lot of missed draws and stuff so they might be over bluffing maybe so i call this one yeah but still i mean always when i think they are over bluffing they still often often are not so i'm still like on the and they make a mistake like that i mean ace nine and king 10 should be the same hand here right so it's like your king 10 should be a bluff catcher as well and he just took some random hand to just keep barreling but yeah yeah that's absolutely fine i was surprised but yeah yeah then we have this year as the next hand yeah in today's times i don't believe villains are over bluffing yes absolutely in general not but there are some spots where just they end up with too many busted draws in some situations so that 10-9 board in a three-bet pot where villains have king jack with a double gutter queen jack and potential king queen offsuit and everything busts that was one of the spots where and you know that i'm i'm like big in in my my folding game is is big and this is one where i'm fine like or we can say like we are unsure let's roll it in 50 something like that so that we we make the decision ourself that we do not call or fold but we can say we decide to overfold slightly and not like crazy like in other spots that's a a chance that we have as well okay that hijack versus big one three bad i just go through three four hands quickly before because then we want to spend the hands that are really interesting and have like especially for jer Jerome, the biggest learning effect, I hope. Let's just see here. We have the pocket threes and we face this here. This tiny three bet from the big blind where I'm already, okay, this guy is more or less a recreational player. So he will always have it from the big blind. And then I didn't run that sim, but everyone who has ever seen a sim of like that spot is just like the low pockets they want to float you explain perfectly why having the diamond is better because not of the vector flush draw maybe a tiny amount but like your two outs are super clean you draw to the nuts more or less instead of like hitting a set on the three of diamonds wouldn't really help too much so it's an okay float but i'm not sure whether it fits to the pre-flop thing that we call all the pockets here and he probably has a very tight range and so on that i'm just yeah if we look it up in the solver it has like zero point something ev and against the correct range so it's like yeah maybe we can just let that go but it's like that's what i meant with the narrowing down ranges uh in the beginning it's like yeah we tried to hit a set more or less because of the good price and yeah you didn't you didn't include if you said like if he's likely tight then it would be a mistake you just went for the small sizing and yeah that's it's only fine right it's like a gto play against someone where maybe we can exploit something but i don't know why it's just my general thing that the big blind is three betting too tight here yeah so i think first small blind i think i mentioned that as well first small blind i like this more because absolutely yes people have their bluffs first big blind i should probably just let it go we we are we just need his freaking six seven of hearts that he c-bets and then check folds and It's just the high risk that he doesn't even have in his that he doesn't even have it in his 3-betting range okay next one pretty easy as well 21-33 yeah we're pocket 9s we are 150 big lines deep against a cut of 3-bet I guess yeah and yeah we are absolutely calling here and villain does the correct thing using a large size on that board and actually if we solve that hand let's just have a look you say like here right away oh this feels ugly it feels ugly which this is what i mean like you're feeling everything is kind of on point when when you when you make those statements which gives me a really good feeling about about you you going forward there it's just what you're just saying is that where's 10 4 3 but actually against the big sizing with that stack death villain using that almost range betting our pocket nines are indifferent so i wrote down here in my sheet that in being indifferent means we can choose especially on the flop right it's like he's not under bluffing he will bet his king queen suited so i want to take the line where villain more likely makes a mistake or i'm likely to not make a mistake right so if villain has slight has slight edge, maybe even, we face like something very good, I just fold. I'm not giving up EV. If someone is really bad and is very likely just betting ace king all the time and then checking down, cool, I take my pocket nines and maybe squeeze out the block bet value on the river. So it's like, both is fine. It feels bad. It's the perfect statement you can make on that flop because it's just it's just what it is right and then the board you end up calling yeah and the board comes with a backdoor flush draw low and you're like yeah it's a pretty clear check yeah i mean it's a mix we can block but we can check i sometimes do even bullshit like a 10% block bet here, just attacking his ace high because, yeah. I mean, people are not bluffing here. I'm never check calling. Someone in the comments said, like, I call up to 75%. We're like, yes, then you just allow villain to play exactly the pot size he wants to play, right? He checks back some 10X on the turn maybe but he's not checking back his king queen offsuit to now start bluffing that's not really happening but obviously can always happen but again we think about is villain bluff heavy i would say very unlikely if if he has a reason to start bluffing again he has clubs and if he had clubs he bets the turn kind of so it's like like a zero EV spot in theory. I like to find a way around that with like tiny block bets sometimes but check folding is absolutely fine and flop you would already fold because this is just a line where you're likely making more mistakes than a villain or no i'm folding if i think villain is very good i'm calling if i'm thinking villains is like worse than i am yeah okay so in a 50 i would probably always be calling yeah okay i see so just because of that right i bet here four dollars on the river he calls his ace king and he will never bluff against it that's like the extra ev that makes it from zero ev to winning five dollars something like that yeah i see okay okay pocket queens 25 35 so almost similar spot someone was a chicken and only called a three bet with pocket queens but gave the explanation which makes it absolutely fine that people are not really attacking under the gun and like the four bet especially slightly deep does not really yeah have a great effect for us so just calling and now something kind of weird happens we get a dry 10 high board and villain does this here and i want to know from the chat what do you read into that bet size try to write down hands in the chat which hands do you think villain might be betting like this this is like a 22 c bet which no one is in this world has this hot key so it's like what could that be seven okay we see sets first we see pocket nines first pocket aces queen jack ace king pocket 10 so we see something nutted and we see some thin value which is interesting because this is exactly what i'm thinking as well i think this spot is it sounds so weird but it's very very similar to how people play the river a river in your-ten spot on the flush board. They size down with the super nuts to have action or have exactly the end they read. I'm not expecting any king-jack of clubs here, to be honest. Like, this is just a hand clicking a hotkey. So it's something. Like, ace is trying to get you in the pot with, like, some floats. Maybe maybe the pocket 10s, maybe something super strong. So actually I ran that board as well because this is just something I needed to learn exactly that way. You learned it here myself that it's just not our board. And the correct thing is to say, thanks for the cheap price. Let's see a turn card and maybe the board gets better for me that's so villain we see it here i offered both sizings and the small sizing is just absolute shit right so the small sizing is absolute shit people do it maybe with checks that they don't want to check back like pocket nines or eights because they want to fall out king queen or they do it with like super nuts just because yeah it's kind of a reasoning in our head to like induce action or whatever reason might be where that is if people are doing that it's not tough to solve that but then it's like still we are not starting it doesn't mean weakness necessarily but it feels like it but it doesn't mean it so something like queens is not necessarily race it's like still we have 117 dollars ev and 200 pot yeah looking at the numbers doesn't make sense when the line doesn't exist but it's just like we should say thank you for net not having to pay 107 all right 107 our ev is just 66 dollars here so it's just like we see more cards for free and then we can we know our range better on a nine on an eight on a five on a six we add more stuff to defend properly and this is the right thing what i like then is because i mean you can guess already that jerome ended up check raising here you build a pot out of position in a spot where you have a disadvantage then you get one of the worst cards in the deck for your hand not for your range and you realize that and just check folded which i'm actually loving that right this is like so freaking disciplined and it's again proven right it's just your feeling was on point here right maybe the sizings are not the same but and the the thing here does not exist villain calls obviously on the jack it's a good card for our range the main play should be a block bet but i mean we are discussing range that does not exist here we check villain bets actually bigish or queens are indifferent right this is just the yeah and we'll have villain have the floats you talk about that very unlikely so making this fold instead of losing another 32 big blinds i love that reaction but this is just something else for the little to-do list understanding okay this is not my board saying thanks for the cheap price seeing that turn card and now just think about villain's hands that he might have he hates his life then you check call 3.5 jack of spades on the turn you might have 9-8 you might have jack 10 suited you might have pocket jacks and from then on it's just way easier to play with your range so that is just a little hint there just for a quick note i feel often like like first this size and then i roll low or something which means aggressive for me and then i feel like i in theory i should do something here you know so then i take a line like this and i'm just lost and i think that's often quite problematic i mean this is the summary the last sentence i will say pretty much it's always like that so i can tell everyone already this is the biggest biggest by far leak in all the hands that when you don't know you go crazy aggressive punting which is like it's like the clearest pattern of all times where this is the only switch like this switch will just like and it should be that you need to do something to like be proud of those moments right to just like this will increase your win rate by six big blinds or so. Like for sure. It's just like, whenever I don't know, stop investing money, right? If you know, okay, it's for sure, I need to continue. Take the passive way, just the other way around, right? Instead of, yeah, we'll see the big puns. And there's always, you attack strength. You attack strength and try to make something happen. Here, the small bet doesn't necessarily mean strength. It doesn't represent it, but it actually means it in a way because he changed something on a board where that sizing doesn't make sense. So Willen has a plan, kind of. This is tough to realize, but we will see other hands. Whenever I don't know, stop investing money. Absolutely. Same here. If I, like, I had one rule that I started in in tournaments i'm never doing a decision in the last second you know that i'm lost i'm lost time bank time bank snap click something last second whenever i don't know i'm timing out like i don't make any bluff catches last second which like maybe you've seen it in my life videos i get caught like not caught because i always have it in those spots. Like they always call last second, which is like, they can't help themselves. They invested so much time. It feels like an investment. You need to do something about it where just this is the worst decisions we're making. So that's a very, very, very big advice there. Okay. That's a good one. Yeah, for sure. Okay. Let's get, I keep going as fast as I can. And now happened no where i lost the i lost the time here at the time stand you want to know the next one i want to go to the second next one like 34 actually because it fits to this one okay again actually you started talking like that if i remember correctly you defend ace jack off suit here against middle position and then you go like yeah i think those top pair top kickers are sometimes check raise i don't really understand why because i don't see the value then you look at your randomizer and you end up check raising we're like okay we are somewhat i mean not lost in that spot but somewhat lost when it comes to knowing the check race ranges building it and understanding where they come from the only reason is then that we sometimes make the nuts and cover some cards which is not true here because we cover the ace already with king queen check races so ace jack is a really bad check race here and not having clubs is a really bad check race as well and it's just like something we check race not with the goal of going directional in to not always be super polarized when we check the turn again we usually check raise a kind of polarized draws or nuts range and this is like add-ons that we do not always have give-ups on the turn if we are checking so yeah here obviously villain can have queens kings aces as well and uh and uh just i have that sim as well just a quick look don't want to discuss that too much this is this is a big punt here right this is a i don't know what was my comment i can look it up in a second so villain even used a 40 sizing not a tiny sizing we see our ace jack without clubs it's like you see some some traces right but that's about it and then we check race and actually you hit your two pair which is all you can hope for and you realize right away it's a freaking bad card for you right so it's like here i don't know whether it was that suit but in my sheet i asked like i made a big where is it here range check turn question mark horrible card right it's like okay this is what we see here and you just kept going with what lots of people are doing just like trying to get value when actually there is no value and then somehow decreasing the size and just somehow playing the hand right now this is we go three quarters on the turn to then going for a ridiculous half pot not knowing even what worse hands should call like okay if you find the ace seven of clubs or the jack ten suited one combination then it's fine right but we are running into like 16 king queens into tens into jacks into aces into sixes and so on it's just starting off with bad check race continuing with investing money in a pot that is like absolute like it's like it's kind of the same pattern it's really investing money into villain strength again just because of our hand it's you're not playing the range if this like you're you were talking about ace king ace queen here what i want to do against ace king ace queen is here to have a safe check check see a deuce on the river bet 75 and i reach the pot size i want to once i face a large bet here i hate my life already and have like a somewhat okay catcher maybe maybe not so it's it's more like that right same pattern but yeah now speeding up a little to get to the most important hands the small ones we can just confirm quickly for everyone who watched the loom i don't want to skip them because it's just so easy to give some little input king nine nine uh that's here we discussed villain check raising the flop and you said again it's so fun this is a tiny spot and you give the perfect explanation like we can overfold here a lot it's a paired board villain has lots of nine x you have them yourself you're protected actually your hand is indifferent already with the queen of spades it's pretty insane this is a paired board hitting the jack doesn't give us the nuts it's yeah it's a standard float but it's already like not winning not losing so once someone is not check raising enough, it's just a fold. And you're not losing money by just folding something like that, which I know it's a bad feeling to be such a nit. And yeah, now on the turn, it's small bets only. We are not attacking anything with a big bet. All the 9x are actually splitting. So it's a big reason big reason why villain should check nine x as well and then we are just attacking his whatever eight seven back like ten eight whatever give up so the big size does not really make sense here and you started yeah in a way hunting money into strength he started check raising on a pair of boards here and then he starts like check calling or something and then yeah happy that you didn't didn't uh go crazy on the river what what was his hand actually 10 9 yeah 10 9 right so yeah there there is nothing we can attack but like just give ups i i would check that mainly back on the turn because we are just crushing his range that gives up and we he's not check raising king x that's just the the fact yeah tiny thing but just i want to just comment on that flop play we can fold the shit out of it it's it's gto kind of do i have it here ah i had it but forgot to save like sometimes i ran it and forgot to save it uh okay but believe me i was actually i was surprised that with a spade we were still allowed to fold that's just like the the pair board where maybe he hasn't even offsuit i'm not sure about the ranges there but yeah okay then let's go six four suited 37 49 yeah one thing on the on the investing money into strength i think a big part of it comes from like how can these guys never check raise bluff or something like i i really don't want them to be so nitty you know because it makes it less interesting to play against i think that's the mental pain i think i kind of feel often what helped me a lot there because i i absolutely know the feeling and i i've exactly made the same puns like throughout my career over and over again like we want to make something happen we don't like just folding is boring just like what helps me is really just speaking things out loud right I have a kind of bullet points like maybe double check the the exercise videos I did like having a session focus right it's like it can be just like fold every zero eb bluff catcher can be your personal session goal what you need to create is an environment for yourself that rewards you for making those folds folding feels bad instead you should have those rewards or not making that punt right it's like it's just like you can make the challenge next time someone raises you on the river laugh at them and throw them the second nuts in the face and fold like exaggerating right but like instead of going over the top mr pocket queens right it's like like yeah they have it they have their whatever and another thing is to always think about both sides so we'll get to that hand where you talked a lot about yeah i think he's never checking back a flush here he's never this that talking about the Talking about the value side only. Not talking about the bluff side, where the only talk about the bluff side is, yeah, he never has a bluff here. Like there's no bluff. And if you can cut down his value combos to like 0.5 combos, if you still compare them to zero bluff combos, it's a hell of a bad call, right? It's like that reasoning of like, I don't find many things many things we're like it helps to do database reviews as well river call efficiency we're just filtering for call river race and then being wrong 18 out of 20 times helps as well to just like you know it you know what your past all the hands you played tells you how they play no one is like teaming up here to to change game style in the future. And now we are going after the Jerome guy because he just did a database review and he will end up overfolding rivers. This is why we're bluffing like crazy. That's definitely not happening. Okay, this one, 6-4, we can discuss the flop strategy here. I don't care. I use a half pot bet here on that board. I think someone on Discord commented commented as well he would use another flop sizing i think here we are not attacking too much with the tiny size but it's absolutely absolutely fine to just split his range into check raises and have a weakened check calling range that's cool turn is a clear check check on that eight of diamonds very bad card for us and on that king of diamonds river he bets half pot so yeah we can discuss two things how much do you think i like this spot to race rated one out of ten for the chat jerome is part of the team as well ten is i love that spot for raising one is i would never race in my life here just get some answers in here three four two one four okay i talked you out of it with my here me show nine eight one okay what do you think now it's getting tough the nine and eight makes it harder i mean i thought like with this hotkey i thought maybe you know i i don't know i'm experimenting a bit with this, so I'm really unsure, actually. I need a number. Like, no bullshitting around here. We need a number. Okay. But I think, yeah, probably like three again or something. Okay. It's at least an eight. So this here is the first spot where your hand is okay, not great it's the first spot where we where we have a chance to attack weakness guys this is like he check all that freaking board he doesn't have an eight he doesn't have a flush he bets random half pot bullshit on the river he's full of shit all the time or has a 10 or a weak king of clubs it's like i mean this is the first time we have the chance to attack weakness this guy is freaking full of and you're like yeah let's let's let's let's let him let's let him go this was what i thought in game but yeah yeah so i i mean i try to take hands that are not blocking his snap faults like he can have six five he can have four five he can have six four the solver is actually fine with that hand because the solver perfectly splits up and this sizing bluffs should be more something like queen jack and never those six fours because they are over betting going with the look alike to their eight six eight four i look that one up this is something i don't want to even go into but this spot here is let's write it down it's it's first of all it's a totally different risk reward you risk 15 to win nine i guess 15 is your race here something like that we could go even smaller i don't care yeah i think i was not sure about the size but i thought if i have a flush or something or kings then i probably go quite big so yeah if you wrap flush or kings or yeah yeah it's fine but we risk 16 for nine so this does not need to work 80 it needs to work 64 that's different right what is villain's range here let's write it down or let's let's paint it oh freaking crying in the background again killing me okay so we have like nuts in that half pot range okay i believe in one trap there are freaking no nuts let's let's let's it's like that then he has like potentially he can have here he can have queen nine he can have six five he can have the busted clubs with a freaking half pot hot key so i make at least this year right and we have the bluff catcher part and with our sizing that we choose what we need is like fold equity like not like 80 we need like 60 so we need him to fold some bluff catchers and all of a sudden our hand is good and if he like our bluff is good and if he folds more bluff catchers we start printing this is the spot this is why i give that an eight or so right it's like it's no way that it like there's no chance that it's burning money it's very certainly okay and there's a solid chance to printing money yeah i love that spot okay let's do the same now let's go into bluffing bluffing mode we're like we get into the punt punt punt uh actually let's go with oh that's time is flying 40 36 i go even quicker for the not interesting ones i mean actually it's pretty interesting but i just want to know the results so small c-bet here middle position versus big blind sorry for the rush it will be on the platform you can re-watch it but i that's like the hands are so interesting so i want to go through almost all of them ace eight suited normal turn but again you thought about an overbet which is okay with the nuts always okay but on that spot which range do we want to overbet still villain can trap some eight x we can overbet kings and kings only if we have a queen again we are kind of blocking calling range i play 75 only and that's it yeah i see and the river is the freaking quads and yeah guys in the chat guys in the chat we need a sizing johanna you start what's our sizing because i say i say guys in the chat so sorry for that johanna you're first to Sorry, 35%, Philip, 200%, 20, 75. A little hint this time, no bluffing for me but we have quads maybe you missed it but we have freaking quads 20 if we are playing in l10 that sounds good 50 what the fuck are you doing i was sure i get 10 times the correct answer here we're speaking one e barino one e barino is like you know the one e sizing micha knows the one e sizing pavel knows the one e sizing all right so we end up doing it and you give the perfect explanation and it feels like crazy. Willen does not check raise twice against normal sizes. There are not many 8x left. He sits on a queen all the time. We have kings, we have aces, we have 8x. Here's one sizing. Here's one sizing, guys. One freaking sizing. And that is obviously the freaking all-in. And yeah, it's not even close. It seems crazy. I know, Philip, you want to go 30 percent that a queen check raises again or to make sure to get called by ace high so uh i don't know i don't know you don't like money somehow pot second best no second best would be one cent less than all in all right so let's let's have a look let's have a look if you crazy, oh, fuck, I missed to save this one. But I looked at it and there's no, like not a mix, it's printing money. There's only one sizing in the SIM. So maybe someone can run it later and post in the Discord. This is GTO sizing because it makes so much sense, right? So, and the way you talked about it and you gave us the little little cliffhanger you you will talk about like the hands i feel like we got a call so can you can you tell us yeah we did uh it called with queen nine or something so johanna you're fine with an answer winning 111 big lines from a freaking queen nine and i mean finding bluffs not tough, right? I would go with spades just to make sure to have the lookalike with my ace eight of spades, king eight of spades, seven eight of spades, nine eight of spades I would have. So I'm just going all in with spades here mainly. And yeah, nice hand, stack for us, stack in our pocket. And pocket. Actually, I'm never bluffing on LL50. I'm crazy. And again, we can draw that. Where's the spot? This time it's obviously great because we have value, but still it's the same spot. I will post the result on the Discord so you can see that I got the call. Nice. So villain has no nuts. Like one trapped eight. Villain has no air either because calling twice on that board, there's no air. So actually villain has only bluff catchers and we attack that with a sizing that needs... Let's do the math. Let's do the math. We have enough time. Villain should fold 87% of the time. Okay. So that is our sizing and this is villain's challenge our sizing is always villain's challenge he needs to find those folds so if he chart starts to call bluff catcher once we are freaking printing if he starts to call a bluff catcher once our bluffs are freaking burning money so now you could think already about do i want want to be bluff heavy or value heavy in that spot? Right? So here, I think I want to be eight out of 10 bluff heavy here. I want to be 10 out of 10 value heavy. And here I want to be 10 out of 10 value heavy as well. Yeah. Spades, but we are not bluffing on L50. Perfect. One Ibarino. Cool. Next one. Great hand. Seven, eight off. I i skipped this one this is just a turn fold you defended seven off two light against the 2.2x open check call an open ender and then check raise an idiot open ender with an idiot flush draw yeah you didn't know you went against strength i didn't even watch the end of the hand you probably light your stack on fire i don't know or you got the fold i take hold of the river but still nice perfect we are working on our red line so but you see the same pattern it was like just attacking strength being lost attacking strength we skip that okay now with three hands left in eight minutes we can do 10 or 15 minutes but punt punt, punt, punt, and potential punt. Okay. So 46, 46. I think the roast is finally about to start now. I mean, we started throughout already because you have seen the pictures. We three bet pocket queens. He calls. Flop is king, jack, six. We can use a big bet and a small bet. We can range bet small if we want. Pocket queens are totally fine. We go for a small bet. Turn is one of the worst cards in the deck for us. Obviously, a 10 of spades would be even worse. But we have a clear check. Nothing else is an option. Cool. We play it like that. You explain it more or less the same way. River is a six. Obviously, Villain has a six-five now, which an ace-six suited, but the six is more or less a brick. We are indifferent between betting small against a check or checking and then being indifferent against the bet. This is what Pio tells us. So yeah, we are really like on the thinnest value we can have because it's indifferent into checking and uh so we go for the block bet i do that all the time villain it's more likely to make a bad call than he is to whatever make a bad bluff i would check fold if i'm checking and then villain raises and at first you start you started talking you know like okay he talks himself into a bad call like it's not a big race and you were thinking about what value could he have like i mean i'm just looking at six five a six i mean sure i'm raising that uh which is just the most natural hands of all times i would say and it's a cheap price okay right it's like is someone bluffing like that floating pocket eights pocket nines with a spade now choosing that sizing is there a chance he's bluff heavy we would need to call 20 to win like a full hundred that's a pretty good price or obviously i mean this is just so insane i don't know this is just so stupid it's like okay we are first i'm i'm thinking my my thought process was about calling is oh fuck it minimizes again it's about calling and i need to be right 20 of the time so i'm thinking in about a situation 20 this should represent 20 80 does villain have enough gloves here value all right and you are going for instead now're fucking minimized. So now we are risking 102 to win 40, 60, 70. This should be the math. We, instead of being, trying to be good 20% of the time, which would be ridiculous, badly call, I guess already. We try to be good instead 60% of the time bluffing it off because this is like the spot where people are definitely raising thinly for value to then have an easy fold. Like to make that a play, you need villain to raise king, queen. Which would be blocking king, 10. This is just like that thought thought process is just so ridiculous it's insane let's say okay we try to have that like okay do we call here if villain has 20 bluffs we're doing let's try to call this year that's good but no let's try to try and make him fold all his value where by not calling we already make the decision that this year already looks more like Thank you. and make him fold all his value where by not calling, we already make the decision that this year already looks more like, like we're saying by not calling that he has not enough bluffs and it looks more like this. And yeah, now, I mean, you see the point, right? This is, this is the strength where like, this is, this has 0% chance to ever get like close to zero ev it has zero ev chance to get printing and it has a hundred percent chance of of like burning money right this is in those spots we can think about okay what is like having those pictures in mind can help a lot right to just really really know okay what is the best case what is the worst case okay the best case is villain is crazy over bluffing or he is believing me the top boat and fold second boat but you realize then while speaking that out loud that this is bullshit that like okay maybe if he's over bluffing then call is the best option and that's about it i mean the the thing that went through my mind last second was kind of like okay i sometimes have jacks or kings and what will happen be my bluffs or something? And I couldn't just get to it. So I just, I don't know, went all in probably last second as well. Right. Being lost against strength. So we tried to do something. If you are here and you are like, okay, I have my king nine suited that I three bet. That's a lookalike to my kings. This is my bluff. Sometimes this is why I roll my randomizer. And has three bad that's a lookalike to my kings this is my bluff sometimes this is why I roll my randomizer and if it's lower than a 15 I'm going for it I'm not saying anything right but it would be something that okay would be like a gto thought like I don't want to be bluffing in that spot he has it I want to be better because he will not be race folding anything like maybe some six five hearts even and this is what we are going for but yeah yeah Thank you. i want to be better because he will not be race folding anything like maybe some six five parts even and this is what we are going for but yeah yeah okay let's go to the next 10 and see how much that fits in here as well is for suited you start with i'm not like i knew already something was happening you started with i'm not sure i will check probably pretty often i still see the subtitles here and like then you roll something and whatever it's first of all the right answer is you could write down to your little to-do list mono boards out of position three bad pots the right answer would be we can bet small we can check doesn't matter same thing don't blow up a pot check full turn right you said that it's probably full i mean we have nothing nothing we have full bullshit air okay maybe the ace of hearts with the ace three suited blocker triggers a little i don't know villain does not step small he goes half pot he prepares something here even and we take the full full shit to go after strength like why are we not just falling i like this is i don't know this this is someone who like who like plays play money games or nl2 who just like wants to waste some three minutes like this is like there's he's incredibly protected we don't block anything if we block anything it's his fault and we don't have any equity against anything if you at least take the pocket sevens and say i have two outs just in case okay okay we can be crazy but we don't have a read on anything we don't have a reason we don't have a we could look that up in piyo it's like but before in small hands we looked up in piyo and see like it's like slightly minus 0.1 and slightly plus 0.1 we can find a reasoning and here we're just going for like an easy minus 10 big line play in piyo or something like that i mean it's like the best part is that he calls down a ridiculous hand as well. We're like, yeah, he called down King nine of clubs and we splash it in on the river as well. We're like, yeah, I don't, that was next level. I like, I don't know where this idea comes from, from all the other hands I heard you talking. This is like your, your drunk brother was taking over the computer. I don't know. I wish, yeah. Now I represent the six that I check raised on the turn. Nice, let's go. I don't know. I was thinking people should check back very often and they don't, so they stab with a way too weak range. That's where it came from, but that that is like think about your range in that way that you like start investing money from the top right you start from the bottom here like it doesn't get worse than that it's like yeah if you take your ace jack with a jack of diamonds at least it's like yeah if you want to go crazy right or you just check fold because it's like it's like yeah he showed strength it's 50 it's not 25 if he bets 25 and it's not preparing it all in i'm not saying too much actually right because then it's that big difference attacking weakness attacking strength right if you bet step small i actually agree that people call their sevens and they don't know what to do so they step small instead and then they are lost right we're here okay like it would be better for my speech now if you just had nine ten of diamonds he had king nine of clubs which somehow for him seemed to be the nuts but still like that that turn sizing changes everything for me already oh yeah nice now we got the next one wow 54 52 so we have the next mono board so first we get the great result here a 300 big blind pot even okay yeah it's the offsuit better to come from a base of being too aggro than being too passive puns get punished and teach you a lesson when you're into absolutely that's the best way it wants to coach it's so easy for you to let them go in theory now i hope you find like some notes that you can pin on your computer to just maybe shorter sessions or speaking while playing we have so many tools to get rid of that so next mono board it's like little hint for like maybe you can you can study a little mono board spline versus spline but you explained it pretty well already you start with like just treat it like a rainbow board and say mono is always evening out a little or actually improving in position a little that's all 10 6 7 is a range check board out of position mono we start with the range check seems like a fair fight we can bet small which is fine as well right so you ended up checking and you ended up check calling that's cool and yeah villain uses what does he use which sizing uh small i think one third small yeah okay now the turn gets interesting because there is an eight eight is the obvious calling range now you can have every in this world, which means he shouldn't overbet ever. He does overbet instead. And now there are two options of reasonings. One makes sense, one doesn't. One option for the reasoning is he tries to get max value out of an eight because an eight is calling anyways. Or the other reasoning would be, he tries to make an eight fold by going all the way because he represents a flush which do you think is more likely i mean i spoiled it already but yeah it's like always there is a like i call that there is a face up calling range and people size up this is when they just have it and when they just have it what their only bluff would maybe be the ace of hearts like for me i take the ace of hearts here as my personal security just knowing i sit here with eight or nine nut flushes and he just punts it into me like cool so i can just fold right so it's like i don't get the price it hurts but it's again yes you have a nice card you have a kind of a nice hand if not this action is happening villain in the most ridiculous way goes massive strength and gets rewarded by you punting into him by just check jamming we can i mean we are risking here what is it 95 big lines to win 25 obviously we have some equity so it doesn't like we don't need the full fold equity but uh what is it 95 to win 25 so it's this math if we didn't have equity we need 80 fold equity with our 20 equity that we have or 18 that we have against flushes something like that we need a little less but yeah it's like people show strength get rewarded right like you just gave three people who played ridiculously bad a stack i mean not this pocket sevens was not ridiculously bad but uh like all the others like this is like this is really that moment laughing at them laughing at them folding sitting there with a nut flush and saying like if you jam your nut flush here because you're scared of the king of hearts coming up i'm loving it i'm loving it right so this is like them telling you their hand and that's it all right let's this is the last time actually i kind of skip this one we're here the main question is you started donking that board the main question is do you know that game plan better than the check raising game tree donking here is fine on that board and then donk re-raising is the same like check raising. So it's absolutely fine on that board. But the question is, you put yourself into like unknown waters where if you say like everyone is blind in that spot and you are somewhat seeing something, that's fine, right? Letting them play your game because you can do it on that board. But it would be more something that you prepared. I prepared my donking game my donkey game on that board i fucked them up instead it's just easier to just check and then go with a check raise or a check call and then it's just easier to not mess up because it's a more natural game plan where uh well villains won't mess up either we're like you are going in the dark streets of where are you living uh it's the netherlands okay it's in somewhere in the netherlands uh netherlands seems so friendly always maybe they have some some some dark streets there as well this is where you're going to then like have like a little fist fight against an unknown we're like i'm not sure whether that is where we want to go so um yeah this is just it's questionable after that i think actually the hand is fine and your plan was fine because i just translated for myself into i check raised and go from there it's same spot and yeah actually i mean i mean i'm rushing through you feel that but i think it's fine just want to want to have that like answer those questions right so gold for the session the hand review see in which way and how much to deviate from the solver we heard really interesting discussions and reasonings that all made sense whenever the spot was small it's like really like there that was like an nl1k to nl5k level just discussing that which hands should we bluff there what should we do there what is the sizings we are using how do we build our range and so on there's little little work here little work there like what i meant with the little to-do lists which is absolutely fine right i have to-do lists for me personally every single day pretty much right where i knew what i could improve in that's a great thing to have but like the standard was very good the thought process was very good and then well we just let our drunk twin brother take over every now and then somehow always when the spot but ugly and villain showed strength that was actually the only thing right even the things were like the the dog shit fancy play syndrome the jack seven of diamonds i'm 100 sure that didn't cost you a single penny right it's like fine this pocket queens cost you 80 90 big blinds we're like okay this is what we maybe just don't do it that's like the the biggest uh biggest advice i can give pinpointing your worst getting aggressive when lost against strength. Floss in my general approach, not really. The general approach looked good. I could write the same thing again. I absolutely don't understand the motivation. Maybe they can't be so bad, kind of. It's like move up to where they respect my raises kind of is swinging a little around there we're like just like no we should like laugh at them and fold when they have it yeah i think when they show strength they have it when they show sorry i they have it. When they show weakness, they don't have it. Most of the time. Yeah. I think it's just very frustrating to me that they, like, it seems like they are so obvious that it just annoys the shit out of me and i'm just still feel like i'm not ready for the higher stakes so it's like that i had that as well that it's so obvious and i do something that it's so obvious on those stakes that i have to have it we're like really it's that not accepting that we just lose some hands where the right perspective would be oh they are so stupid this is why i lose so few chips in a hand like that that it's like i should lose way more in right see that what i mean with like laughing at them and just fold i'd like i fold my ace of hearts if you bet normal i check all if you bet the river normal i might sometimes check check jam bluff and you have an easy catch with your flush well like you just messed up big time and this is why i win big money against you right so big money the there's like i would say two parts right so little to-do lists because whenever you are not lost this right so it's just a big goal to not be lost and 3.2 chain of mindset not let your drunk twin play it anymore it's it's just like really this laugh at them and fold right hammer on weakness right really just like that have pain pain thought in mind in bluffing and catching spots right risk reward that would be something for the next maybe you can do that for the next sessions you play just do the review and every time you put out a big river bat or a river race double check on your risk reward like end villain snap calls villain snap calls and so on yeah um that would be it right playing with rng we try to not use it too much it's fine when we when we know it doesn't matter then it's good when we are lost it's not a good idea to use the randomizer right because then we use it as an excuse to do something bullshit right then take the passive way yeah this now i need to wrap it up here a little but i think that's it i'll can answer that in private to you later but yeah i want to want to say thanks to the chat for everyone who participated. Big thanks to you again for letting, yeah, for getting roasted a little. And I hope everyone could take away something from it. Let's keep the discussion going in Discord. This is so much in those hands. Jerome put so much effort in it, which I loved. So we can just keep discussing the hands there. You said you share the results uh maybe another little loom with just like a little fun results of the hands whatever you are up to and yeah now i'm off to a crying baby i guess and i have finally some some word to eat last words are yours jerome okay well stefan thank you so much for for this really in-depth coaching I think I got so much out of this. So it's really, yeah, this is the best I could wish for joining Polka Code. So thanks a lot. And also to everyone, I really like that you guys appreciate my punting. So that it really, yeah, I know. It feels a work, warm, welcoming words from everyone. So, uh, I think that's great for everyone as well to just show anything you doubt about like, PolkaCode seems like the perfect place to share it and to get better from it. So yeah. Thanks guys. All right. Have a good one. See you later. Yes. Ciao.
