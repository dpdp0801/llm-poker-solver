### TOPIC: cash hand review 13
 Hello to the first participants here. Let's do it. Hey, Alan. Hey, Andreas, Frankie, Pavel, obviously. Some more early birds coming in in a second, I guess. We are still working on the Kahoot that Kai prepared for us. So super thrilled for that. It's called, what is it called? Fun Poker Live, like something like that. Yeah, today I'm trying to focus on the more lighthearted aspect of poker. It's live poker. It's the definition of vacation per se. So the Kahoot today will be about guessing the showdowns i think stefan you mentioned the instagram influencers who sometimes ask what did villain show and we have four or five questions and the winner of the kahoot tonight or today will get a month of discord nitro courtesy of hannes so that is pretty cool okay that sounds good i don't have it like i i thought like hannes never gave it to me so i i'm fighting hard and chose my nickname wisely for that so i don't know whether you we are still testing because kai doesn't have a second screen right now and we obviously don't want to show you the answers do you see my name already on the kahoot list yeah i see it okay so now we should post the kahoot pin somewhere i'll post it in the chat for you guys it's as always always www.kahoot.it. And then you get asked for a game pin. And that is the following that you see in the chat right now. 959-8667. And then you just update us a little how many people are in the Kahoot. We need 10 at least. Maybe you only have the basic version and 10 is the maximum. So it's first come first serve and all the others. We are sorry for that, but too slow it's an early bird session today i'm having my coffee ready here and we were just discussing the coffee culture in melbourne so oh super hello let's go yeah maybe a while we're waiting for everyone to join question to you stefan when was the last time you played a live cash game i mean it has to be the poker coach festival in bratislava i was there last september and yeah we had some fancy with like lots of the poker code members like a 5-10 table going was like three slovakian weirdos in a way like the like you know those casino regulars you have in every city and they are like always some kind of shady persons i feel like and then we had like five other people that are from poker code that were just enjoying their night and having some years. Yeah. And ripping off those, yeah, not great people it felt like. And then we had like five other people that are from Pococo that were just enjoying their night and having some beers. Yeah. And ripping off those. Yeah. Not great people, it felt like. But I think this was the last time. So what's your mindset going into these? Because I feel like it's such a different game than watching people play online or play online yourself. It's just an entire different animal. And I think for me personally, it's tough to actually get into the right mindset if you want to play profitably to actually have the patience and the pace and to understand you're probably only going to play what 300 hands and you could get crushed yeah the problem is that my plan there was not to crush so i want to have a fun night which is like already something very different so i could obviously loosen up a lot with just the goal of like talking myself into huge post-flop edge and justify everything with that. But like as a standard, it's really that we need to forget all standards that we are having. He spent like, we can play our standard when it's on us. It's a way bigger difference between action and reaction game because we need to react way more than online. Online, we know guy's open raising this and he will have 25 range or maybe 27 or maybe 23 but there it's like yeah no clue whether this guy is limping king six off from under the gun or not right it's like it's and this is what i mean with the reaction game so making quick reads is very important just every showdown should give you at least three notes in your head and then it's like well you are reacting you are playing one time you're playing versus a 60% lifting range the next time you're playing versus a 40% opening range and this obviously changes everything if you think in the pattern of i play big blind versus mp open you're lost already right if against those i mean not lost you're playing against fun players mainly but it's like you're not maximizing yeah yeah i mean this is definitely the theme of this session today so glad you brought it up we have 16 people in here which is i guess totally fine for the early bird session and yeah how many do we have in kahoot do we get closer to the 10 yeah we have seven but i'll start with the first hand and i think by the time it goes to showdown we start the quiz yeah maybe just a little bit of background what I what I want to run through with you guys today is I have a couple of hands that I played here in the Crown Casino in Melbourne on different occasions the ones that I want to start with is basically from my session two days ago I went on a Tuesday night and played some 1-3 low stakes cash game just to see if something crazy happens there and something crazy did happen there so it took me around four hours i almost went home pretty sad that nothing crazy happened but i got a pretty cool one and later in the session i have some interesting two five hands that are a little bit more from a saturday night with much different type of game setup and in total we have five hands and i have a sixth one in the backup if we still have time so yeah maybe let's just start with the, Stefan. Yeah, maybe I explain a little bit my thought process and maybe you can say something about what you see or what you would do differently if we should do like that. What I would like to do, just give everyone the chance to think it through themselves. Always present the hand in a neutral way first. Like just say what happened instead of adding your thoughts, right? Maybe I will add something on that and then we'll discuss thoughts each other, right? Because then everyone has the chance to make up their mind already. We're like, where's actually the trouble spot, right? If you start a hand with, oh, I had a tough decision on the flop. Other people might not see that flop as a tough decision. So we start here. I think I've seen already, we face a button limp here. This is how we get into the hand with 10-4 off. And then we do this, we do that, or you decide it, like try to keep it neutral. And then we go into reads and reasonings. All right. So usually how it works in Crown is you get your ticket, you sit down and I usually wait for the big blind. So I had a couple of hands to watch, to see how the vibe was. And again, it's a Tuesday night. So it's a Tuesday night game. Nobody's drinking, a lot of middle-aged people, and it's just a very limpy and chill atmosphere. Nobody wants to really play big pots unless they have it. So I would call it very loose pre-flop and very nitty post-flop, if you understand the setup. So after a couple of hands, I get dealt into the big blind and yeah, we face a limp from the button. And for me, there's nothing else to do than just to check this hand. I don't want to do anything weird with my 10-4 off. So I check this one and we get to the queen 8-5 rainbow flop i don't have any lead with this hand to be honest if i'm looking to lead something it should have at least some sort of equity so for me this is just a check and i don't want to have anything to do with this hand by this time so i'm just checking c4 checks behind we have an ace on the turn now we got him ace on the turn is something Yeah i mean i checked my big mind behind i i don't even think i could credibly represent that ace he doesn't have it but he probably also knows that that i don't have it so for me this is again something that i don't really want to bet i still have chances to bluff at the river on a couple of cards so again for me this is just a check so c4 checks behind and on the river we bink a 10. And at this stage, I just sat down. I don't even have the $1 chips. So I only have the $5 chips, got $2 back from my big blind. So usually I would see and find if I can find a one big blind block bet here. My third pair in a limp pot feels like an eight or a five or a king high or whatever. Basically, I have no clue what the guy has. I have a pair in a little pot that has been checked around so i just i want to bet a big blind here so i threw in the five because i didn't have any smaller chips and we get a snap race snap race from the bottom like he like my chips were in for two seconds and he snap raced it here and i was like okay i don't think i'm gonna win this pot i'm not here to battle with people who raise me on the river on my first hand. So it was pretty hard actually for me to put him on a hand, to be honest. I was like, what the fuck is this? I was totally lost. And this is the first Kahoot question. I fold it and he shows the hand. But maybe before we go to that, Stefan, is there anything you want to add here? I mean, it's not for your hand, but the spot itself, right? So I think because it's something that happens a lot in those those games we get to play trash because people just give us the free equity and then we still want to have a strategy we're here i like a lot just your clear categorization but we could say like he has nothing let's blast which would be level one in a way right here it's like you talk about your range if you think of like doing something you want to have like some connection to the board some kind of backup where here well we have a freaking 10-4 nothing nothing so we check the flop we check the turn interestingly that you point out that the ace is actually kind of a brick in that situation obviously he might have some ace-4 suiteds that he tried to to like bring to showdown just starting on the flop with the check back and now on the river it's very important to realize that that that, that we have actually a clear value hand, right? So it's like, and there's like, first thing that comes to mind is this dice principle here that I think about. I don't care about what he might have because I have no clue. No one here can have a clue and it's really a wild guess what we will do in a second. So I think about, okay, what is the hand I'm targeting? I want to get a call by an eight, nine that checked back all the way. I want to get a call by a seven, eight. I don't want to lose the maximum to, I don't know, a queen deuce or a pocket queens that trapped me or a king jack that checked down. So it's like, it's more, the only question I'm asking myself on the river is, which bet size is he calling with an eight or with a five? It's like, not even theory, like this is my range and I can use a large sizing or a small sizing or whatever. It's no, the only mind is i want him to call an eight and that's it or a five and i think actually like i don't need the one big blind i would be fine like like my line would be three 350 maybe like just feeling wise that he i checked it back what the fuck i have got a call now you can have everything and then one three it's i wanted to do one big blind which is three dollars oh three yeah i thought that two two into seven no that's cool perfect three three point five three that's i mean i cannot say maybe five is the best and he is never folding an eight but that's just the the feeling you get in a way just like not checking to then potentially check call off i guess check call would be the worst play check fold would be a fine play and bet for value fold against any action should be the best play read list so that's kind of my take on that one i just started the kahoot he raises we fold and he shows me all right and the first question is what does oh fuck you actually ah damn it i messed up you need to show actually the the kahoot like we don't see the answers you need to show it on the screen but now you have it on the phone right because we only see the on. Ah, okay. Never mind. I'll restart the Kahoot, sorry. We talked about it before and I messed up. So that one is on me, guys. That's all right. That's all right. I'll do it on the screen. Just to make sure that we jump in again. I hope you guys have fun with it. I thought it was funny, but it would be horrible if all of you guys think, oh, it's not even funny. All right. It's a very showable hand. I can tell you that. All right. Okay. We are not expecting the King Jack now. We got it. But it's really the... I'm... One more spot open, Pavel. You got it? So... We're starting. One hint would be, one advice maybe. Have a hand in your head that you would go without options now because you will be presented four options now. And if yours is somewhat close, you have a good feeling already. Okay, it can only be two. It can only be two of those. I have to balance my facial expression range now a little bit. I mean, the way you presented the story, there's no way it's like a queen eight or 10-5, I feel like. We are in the more polarized section. It was the queen eight. Like the double check back race river queen eight of flop top two. So that the first hand i played two days i was like okay this definitely means something i think it's important for the next hand because the next hand is basically against this person but wait a second here because this year is big for learning reasons because i got asked a lot about can we do something about live poker and this is our chance i don't have live poker hands and now we get them presented in a nice way it's not about the hand right we made a great fold and we are super happy to fold here all day long and still we think it's a clear value bet this is important not be like i should have check folded no perfect value bet maybe a little too big with that chip problem but now it's the most important part of live poker we have total wild cards on there and now we want to make at least three notes in our head in a way right so kai this one is on you what's your notes now that you mentally take on this player to go into the next time so first of all super sneaky the double check back apparently he's allergic against value a little bit so this is one that i take second is that goes for a lot of these players in these games if they raise it they have it especially on the river i'm not looking to pay off any raises and the third one is a timing tell he was so fast with raising there he had it planned out all day long so he planned it so he knew what he was doing the chips were ready the 18 was ready so the timing thing so everything here i want to exploit to the max so if i play against these people i just i want to play as exploitable as i can and i think this will come up in a later hand as well okay so we have a couple of things here right so he had the plan already on the flop kind of which is telling us with a timing tell this is huge right we know he had the plan before it's not he doesn't interact with the river necessarily it's like maybe it takes three seconds to realize the king jack or jack nine straight or something like thinner value like 10 5 maybe this is thin value in his eyes i don't know so it's we can discount that the plan was there and we have a couple of things to exploit that obviously we go for the value we want to go for and then we fall to any action. But the other way around is even more important for your EV is going hell freaking crazy when you have it, right? Because this here is, do you think he's raise holding? If you just bump it, whether you bump it up to 50 or 150 is probably the same thing. So it's like, because just this thought that he had in mind, he had it all planned out. So we're obviously obviously not trying to bluff but this is a big difference in ev getting a hundred dollars more out or not and then the other thing is okay we see a limp and it was queen eight off this is actually the most interesting that like i want to see whether he raises overall and only limps weekends that would be golden to have that read or whether he just limps everything but plays like a rather loose i mean queen eight off from the button is obviously fine if you play with a limping range there but still this can give us give us good reads if we combine it with like two three four more situations where we have seen a showdown so just how much information he gave us with showing his cool plate queen eight is insane right if we don't see anything we would still have like some kind of doubt in our brain, right? It's like still, maybe it's like he checked back and he like, we cannot have anything. He can just erase everything that he checked down with. Maybe he was even bluffing. It's like those thoughts started running through our head where now we just know everything. And I feel like I have a picture in my mind of like exactly of that Slovakian guy I played with in Bratislava. Like a super sneaky guy who was like, I don't know, like who I'm pretty sure he's like taking every angle and cheat opportunity as well. Like maybe it was a super friendly guy just reading the newspaper. But this is the image I have in my mind now. No, I actually got to talk to him a little bit because the next hand is against the same guy. And they were, I think, one orbit in between between and he actually limped a lot so i i can safely say that he limps all kinds of trash i also saw him raising then later in the night but at this point i just knew queen eight off it's not even the bottom of his limping range so he limped i think king six off early position as well so he just came there to play but he was also pretty nitty to be honest because i don't think he put chips in post-flop at all in any of the instances and he was playing for 12 hours and he had a 400 stack or 420 stack for after 12 hours of play he said that so in my mind i was like okay he's just trying to find some nuts and make some fancy plays with it definitely not the guy who's blasting off because 12 hours of blasting off nobody can afford that here in melbourne to be honest yeah maybe let's take a look at the next one so this was one orbit after and sorry for the switch positions but the same person is two places to my right so it's a little mixed up here and we're faced with a limp again and the part i want to discuss here already starts pre-flop so it's not even quite clear to me what the best range of isoing over limp is, but my heuristic is that at this point, usually I'm in the cutoff and I have three people behind me to act. So then I have a cutoff opening range here. It's more that I have four people behind me to act because the limper can act as well. So obviously I want to be a little tighter than the cutoff, but then again, the person already told me that he doesn't have aces. Well, I don't know that bias, but I assume that. I assume that his limping range is somewhat capped. So this kind of makes up for it a little bit. So as a starting point, I would then go back to basically opening and isoing my cutoff range here, even though there's one person more, but feeling that the person that's limping here is capped in his range and not playing back a lot. So's why i decided to iso my king 10 off here and also i feel that because i saw the king six off in the other hand i feel like there's a lot of setups around you know hitting the top pair king that go my way even though he could have king jack as well but i feel like king 10 is kind of good enough to go for the value iso here yeah i think this preflop spot is really really interesting because this is something that like everyone who goes out plays live poker just experiences every day we play against a limper what is the strategy here right so and I like the thought process you just mentioned a lot like usually if we open race we have like three uncapped players behind now it's like we have a fourth player behind but he's potentially capped some others who include limp raises are uncapped what does that change so already that idea not thinking like being strictly like i'm in the cut off i'm in the freaking cut off so i should do this and that that's bullshit obviously so here we have three uncapped players behind and one potentially capped player potentially on a weak range so how does that change things right i compare it now to a spot that is just we are in the middle position and the big blind is a very tight player, right? Maybe you have seen some of my live plays where I say, I'm just open raising a little looser because this guy is a nit. This is now not true when it comes to calling probably, but it's more about the, am I facing re-raises? Am I facing three bets? Which here, I don't expect many limp raises from that guy. So actually it's like button, small blind, big play normal ranges and the only info I'm having is like low jack he will be calling maybe sometimes folding but usually not re-raising so this is where I try to transfer this spot into another spot that I know now this is obviously different in those spots usually it's like we can see it another way as well that low jack is the first player that showed interest in the hand, which is, well, something else than folding, right? So he has like probably not his bottom 30% of his range either. And so it's kind of like an open race. And then we decide to three bet where King-10 off obviously seems a scratch to be three betting, but it's in a way a capped range. So this is kind of things we need to work with and now i lost like something i wanted to say as well right exactly the one difference that we have is in those spots i'm usually playing three bet only which would mean iso only here but we have a way better price like there are three dollars kind of dead money that in a way protect us as well because it slows down other people from squeezing as well because still there might be someone like People are scared of the if of the if like he might still limp aces whatever right so we have a way better price so i definitely want to play a flatting range and the way i do that in live poker is just that i look at my hand what are the properties of my hand what do i want to achieve and you pointed that out already you have cooler potential hitting a top pair this is great right so you want to iso against the low jack because of that you want to achieve? And you pointed that out already. You have cooler potential hitting a top pair. This is great, right? So you want to iso against the low jack because of that. You want to play a lower SPR. You're not interested in playing like a super deep pot where you make the nuts because it's tough to make the nuts with king 10 off. You want to play a heads up pot against that guy, flop a 10 high board, flop a king high board. This is why we race. The other way around, we could flat our ace three suited suited we are not interested in building a pot hitting a top pair and then actually after getting called once we don't have value anymore against this player type with like our weak top pair so there we rather get into a five-way multi-way pot and make a flush over flush right so it's really some hands work well with a lower spr where we get only down to like playing against one player some other hands play super well in like a five-way pot because we know we have nothing or we are drawing to the super nuts like talking about low suited aces talking about any pocket but against that guy do I need to iso pocket sixes I don't think so right it's like maybe somewhere there's the clear value threshold and this is how I I want to structure that. So it's really a two-step thing. I built my defending range, thinking in my head about which hands I'm playing. Like you can think about a card matrix starting from the top left, like, okay, do I defend 10%, 20%, 25%, maybe 30%, maybe 40%. And then how do I split that up? And that comes back to our properties of the exact hand. Do I rather play a heads up pod that is a little bigger already with less stack behind? Or do I play a multi-way pod with infinite stack behind? We're like, yeah, it's kind of a way. Fast play, cooler, overcooler, slow play, cooler, undercooler. Like it's a little navigation thing. Okay. So long talk for nothing, but I think this is a very, very important thing. Yeah. And that's why I included it. It's not the spot per se. It's not really super interesting, but it's a common common one and i think it's good that we talked to it or that you talked to it but in general like the i have no shame over limping here as well i have no shame especially if i know that the button and the blinds are just not being active i'm happy to take my equity into the multi-way pot specifically with the suited hands yeah so he limp calls and we get the ace King Jack two-tone flop and for me this is just the board to simplify i think i can get away with a small range bet here pulling out a lot of his pockets that he might limp i don't see him continuing any of the pockets here this is just the easiest give up spot for everything from deuces up to nines i would say i also think with the 10 i actually have pretty nice insurance here the 10 in spades even if i run into the limp days so yeah i simplify and go range bet third or a little less yeah i think we could like great reasoning i think we could go even smaller right we don't need this third pot against pocket deuces pocket force and here but i don't care really this guy is not putting money in himself so maybe for everyone who was in the last coaching two weeks ago about the racetracks, we have a certain goal that we want to reach with our hand, which is kind of this bet size that we want to get in, right? Whether we bet min bet twice in a row or we get this money. We know this player is calling a queen jack, calling a jack 10, calling a king six, calling an ace as well. But he will check all those hands all the way through if he doesn't make two pair two pair right and maybe he value bets thinly with like an ace five on the river and we actually have an easy fold it's just like we want to get to a certain pot size this is like i look at that and i think like okay i would like to have a certain pot size on the river which would be between 50 and 65 like just my gut feeling now i don't have clear two streets where i can either go min bet and then do something on the turn to get another call from queen jack or a weaker king that's yeah depends yeah we have to look look this guy deep in the eyes think about how much he's calling but nothing else like all the theory we learn does not really matter here we need the plan and then execute i'm also happy if he folds which unfortunately he doesn't so brother quickly calls and yeah we get the jack turn and he checks to us. And I mean, I don't see any reason to, I obviously hate, already hate my life a little bit. I'm actually pretty happy that I only have a king here. So I feel like, well, I'm not losing a lot in this money either way. So for me, there's no reason to put any money here into the pot. So I just check behind. Hand plays well and I even have outs against the against the jack so yep we reached our pot size already that we are looking for the jack changes it and now we would like the pot to be 34 again um but yeah this is part of the game hope to check down against his king six maybe he checks down at 10 9 not thinking about catching at any point probably exactly my thoughts my hopes but i wouldn't post the hand if it was that straightforward he basically snapped bats 25 on the river and for me i mean let's not think about gto and catches and everything i feel like they just put it in when they have something here there's no i folded out so much shit on the flop that's all the shit's already gone the flop screams me so i the flop hits me so hard that i would even think that he wouldn't even value bet really every ace i think he's so fucking strong if he bets into that my check behind range is also pretty strong i could have all the good i would even check behind a screen probably here so i just don't feel like people would pick this spot to bluff me of something that i you know where obviously have something here so one little rule here that helps is really to think about like think about if you would catch now which hand do you hope for to see if you can kind of come up with a single one then at least it's okay ish but often there are spots where we hope for them to be bluffing but we cannot even articulate one single hand we're like here yes 10 9 of spades oh wait that that's blocked even right it's like and then like i even mentioned the snap call on the flop he is connected to that board it was not like i float my pocket sixes with a backdoor spades to have like out of position float bluffs on the river on that board once he checks back like no that was like that that train of thought takes longer and is not in this player type's head anyways. So it's like, yeah. If anyone out there wants to bluff catch, tell me a hand in the chat that you wish to see them. Oh, we have a quick question in the chat actually that I missed because I minimized. What's the rake like? Just depending, we talked about the limps before. How much is a limping strategy punished by the rake? The rake is horrible. I shouldn't be playing this game to be honest, but thought i have to do it you know for it's 10 10 rake with a 15 cap this is it's pretty bad on two five it's the same 10 15 cap and on five ten it's the same with 50 so once you go to the higher limits it actually gets kind of okay but you really have to pick your spots and just get a good table and if the table is not juicy enough just get up and leave i'm just seeing like super this is insane limping at my local casinos especially on the button would leave the pot to one dollar if checked down to the river seems like they take like a standard fee of two dollars per street or i don't know i mean this is insane comes down to a little easy 70 percent rate there oh boy oh boy no it's not not that bad bad, but yeah, it's still pretty bad. So 1-3, I don't think there's in any world where this could be remotely profitable, even if you have a sick edge, that the rake is just too insane. And they rake preflop as well. So this is something that should also be important. If it comes to three betting light, forget about it. It's value only. No three betting King-9 suited to take it down pre-flop they take 10 of that it's just not worth it so yeah that was the second hand and now let's move to the fun part of this session so there's no kahoot for this question but there will be one for the next one so i just wanted to illustrate or show this hand because we had the limping idea that we discussed and we also have the snap fold on the river that i think is important in these games and yeah this was basically yeah it was already i think 12 midnight i really needed to go home because i had to work in the morning i was like oh man if i only have these two hands to talk about now it's not that great and then this gem here happened so the seat seven or the person next to me was actually another german so he was a ge So he was a used car salesman. I would say 25, 26 with a certain attire to him. So he showed me his nice cars. He told me what car he drives. He drives a C63 AMG and he loves everything that's expensive. And I can recall that because I thought, oh my God, I mean, we're going to rumble. This guy is going to play a lot of hands and be splashy. However, over the three hours I played with him, he only limped and he raised twice. And I only saw him put money into the pot once and he had it. So he was turned out to be a huge knit, which is super weird because he didn't look like a huge knit, which is important because I play a hand against him. Okay. He opened limps and we have a six way limped pot. And this is the 10, three suited. I'm not even too mad about this one because it's suited and yeah, I'm not doing anything here except checking behind. Would you agree or do you have anything? Yeah. It's like, as you mentioned the last one with the three betting, like we are only going for value here. We are not, not after our full equity to then, to then collect 90% of the money that goes into the middle. Yeah, we check, hit a flush or a trips or something. We're actually like the two pair is not even too tasty six way on that board anymore. But let's see. So yeah. So first thing that happens is after me, the big blind checks to him is he actually leads out into the whole group of people. So this is already pretty strong in my opinion. Like these games are usually limped around and then somebody who steps at it that's the person who got something so i don't think i would be super surprised if this person actually comes up with a nine eight of hearts type of play here or a not probably not even a queen jack of hearts type of play so when he bets i think the rest of the table has the same assumption which is why it folds to me and i'm here with my second pair and my backdoor backdoor flush and backdoor straight draw and i feel like i'm not happy about my spot but i do think that there's a couple of nice things that could happen that could lead me to maybe stack an ace king ace queen type of hand if i hit certain runouts And I also think that if the runout gets a little ugly, I can find ways to bluff him off if it's necessary to do so, or if he shows some weaknesses down the road, because he's just very face-up. And I think if the right runout, I don't know, if the five pairs and I have to, I don't know, maybe I don't think about the bluffing part too much. I focus more on maybe improving my hand a little bit here because we still have 437 left to play with. And I just think it's, I close the action and I just throw in the 10 bucks here. So do you think just like from how tight he was, does he have pocket fives in the range? Is there any chance we are kind of drawing that? Yeah, there's a chance we're drawing that. Yeah. Okay. But like aces, the big bet, I don't see it too much. That's like still the one that kind of traps or bets small so it's like we have the 10 block like the 10 blockers is cool here with like i think just check calling to see the next card doesn't make sense but with plans in the back to go crazy right if the run out is a six seven i'm ready to like to like do something if like that player type is is like that the way you described right we're here yeah important we are folding king 10 offsuit we are folding queen 10 offsuit right away and this is like our 10 with potential right we could fold it just just fold it and it's like okay he has it but if we want to play back at some point or make use of a read that he maybe is even a post flop knit and folds to action then this is the ones where we have like the how i call like kind of a safety net with us with like those that say what is it backwards trade let's say two percent equity the backdoor flush another five percent equity our five outs giving us 20 until the river so actually we should have something like 25 equity and have to pay 10 to play for 38 depends now on how much we realize that and this is where all love opportunities come into play, where we can over-realize maybe a little. So it's like, I don't love it. I don't hate it. Let's see what's happening. In my defense, I was still looking for a nice hand to present to you today. So I kind of took one for the team here. I want the record to show this. So I had to call. You haven't today. I just made a short live session playing Zoom 200 and i was like i lost in a three-bet pot on the river and then someone in the chat live just wrote me redline it in redline it in i know i i was full of shit but had like one of the worst bluffing hands just blocking call downs pretty much and i was like okay that convinced me let's redline it in for the team give the fans what we sometimes need to do. Sorry? Give the fans what they want. Yeah, so we check call and we kind of hit a great card. And so at this point, we probably can circle back to the racetrack idea here a little bit because I think that there's a good chance that if my opponent has an ace top pair type of hands, he will probably fire off another bet. Probably a small bet. This is something that I see a lot where they just go again for $10 or something like that. And I feel like there's little chance that this person would actually check behind because why this card is so, so innocent, right? I think there's a big chance that we will see another bet and then that we can then decide to open up the racetrack a little bit and go for the check race and really try to extract value from let's use that one for another question before the because i love the spot so everyone in the chat everyone who is there in the community chat there type in your number from like right now what is the final pop size you try to achieve like at that certain moment i, like putting Willen on ace, king, ace, queen. I think if we get all the stacks in the middle, we end up against pocket fives and ace 10. Like I think stacking off is too much, but just think about what is your number as a little practice tool here. I think of my, like, I have to close the chat here. I've seen the first number already. This is kind of an anchor. So I'm just thinking about what I would do what i would do like just like it's either i thought about just donking big and taking two big streets like i don't give a shit he has ace king ace queen i want to get to a certain point right there could be something i don't 25 now 88 in the middle on the river minus eight dollars rake so 80 in the river on the river then i bet pot on the river he doesn't get away and then we end up at like a 240 region all right minus 10 and where we do go for the check raise maybe he bets half potish again maybe he goes for max protection which would be like 30 35 maybe for those player types and then check raising let's say we check raise smallish to 85 then it's going 170 in the middle we already are at 200 and then it's like how much more value can i extract on the river we're like and this like so you see already the the play options depend a lot on what is the actual pot size that we want to achieve and this all depends on the player type we're like do we think he's investing that amount of money with ace king ace queen or is there the certain threshold where we isolate ourselves against ace five ace ten pocket fives maybe which obviously we don't want so what do we have here two hundred dollars from chaka two hundred dollars from jerome 175 from super anyone else so for for everyone who tuned in the chat somehow is not working because we are presenting together i don't know why so we met in the community study cache in discord and they are in the chat just maybe you will find it there if you want to type in your answer as well. Do you have a number in your mind? Yeah, I think 200 is a pretty good number, to be honest. Obviously, I would love it to be more if the person is calling down lighter. But I feel like that person, if they put in half their stack, maybe 200 is even too big. I think with my read at the time, I would much rather have,'s say 200 but i feel like that's so we got like one correction here darone is going for it he said he meant like investing 200 so 450 pot let's freaking go the thing is right if we have that racetrack idea in our head it's the question we can manipulate this player because it's like really we have those feelings in a way until a certain point, they are really not caring about the size too much, right? Whether you are donking 20 or 35, I think they don't care too much because call is the only option. They won't even start like thinking about anything else with ace, king, ace, queen. If they bet and we check raise, yes, they see the check raise and might find hero folds right away. But they won't make a difference whether we mint check raise from 30 to 60 or we go to 110. I think there are those certain points where maybe on the river, if we, let's say we donk 25 here, on the river, it might be a difference whether we bet 120% pot or we just go 75 or just half pot the safe way that he surely calls. We're like, this is something where I actually like to maximize things on the turn here a little, especially in the live setting, because it makes more sense that he cannot let go on the turn already. But yeah, now I'm super interested in seeing how things turns out. I don't have a clear opinion. I love the donking options as well, even though it doesn't make any sense. But I think just like he snap calls and then we are on the river in a big pot, which already is nice. Yeah, I have to admit, I didn't really think a lot about dunking. But in hindsight, I think dunking is probably something that I would have really loved to do. Because what happens here is I get a little triggered by his size. So triggered may be the wrong word. But I feel like when when he bets 15 here i already think that if he had pocket fives in the spot he would have sized up a little bit definitely like so when i see the 15 i'm getting a little greedy because i want to be greedy and i feel like but i'm loving it it's like maybe he has like aces is the one they put in that same range because they block everything from like a perspective that makes sense but this is more like zoom 200 experience now like this player type is probably aces flush draw protection let's be safe right yeah or maybe not we will find out in the kahoot later i'm pretty sure so yeah i love being greedy against that side so i go for 50 but that is not greedy my friend i got greedy because you know the pot size will be a bit larger not the anticipated 200 yeah but i mean i'm like i take this point and i'm all in on the river on a break like this is my check raise to 92 and then let's freaking go this is what i mean with greedy okay yeah i understand maybe greedy is the wrong word but i felt like if he's betting 30 i'm not even sure if i check race to be honest maybe i use it as a call down but fun thing is so i throw in the 50 and i swear to you guys the chips are still rolling and i say 50 the chips are rolling the person screams 200 while my chips are rolling so this is the fastest snap three bet that I have ever encountered in my i would say i play live poker for maybe 12 13 years i have never seen someone say 200 while the chips are still moving on the table okay here we need another break and really think about like every action means something what does it tell us about his range before we were against ace, king, ace, queen. Now I think we have a clear spot that we can totally rule out ace, king, ace, queen out of his range. So what is left? So there's another thing. In Crown, there's a 30 second time limit on your decision. So the guy says 200 and the dealer starts the clock already. And I'm like, what the, what did he do? Is this really happening? This is the first 10 seconds that went off my clock trying to understand what's just happening. And I look at the board and I was like, okay, do I even have the nuts here? 20 seconds ago, I felt like I have the nuts, but do I really have the nuts? I don't think it's nowhere near it, to be honest. Ace-10, ace-5, fives, four deuce off, really? But there's a couple of hands that already beat me and to be honest i don't see any bluffs here is it the queen jack and spades that's doing that for half of a stack what is this i'm dead i feel like i'm dead i'm not putting any more money in this get out of here nice try for me that was like dude whatever get out of here take my 50 and be happy i only invested like 20 big ones in this hand i can hold my head high and I have a good story for Steph to tell later. So I felt like for me, that was just a fault. I just don't want to invest any more money in this spot. And this is like for everyone, this is something that is very, very, very tough for beginners, right? Especially under the time pressure to reevaluate the situation. Maybe if you followed me in all the looms I did the last days, I presented a hand I was really, really unhappy with where I got married to my bottom two pair. I had 6-4 on king 6-4, turn was an 8, and he raised on the flop, bet big on the turn. I even re-raised on the flop where I missed that spot where my hand was an okay bluff catcher at some point and had no value whatsoever. And it was kind of a similar spot spot where like, yeah, let's fuck it. Let's go freaking in, which doesn't make any sense. And this is why it drives me so crazy. It's like really, no, I was playing against ace king, ace queen before. My play was great, but now I'm sure he doesn't have that anymore. So we have to switch our mind, like not be like, oh, we had a great value spot before. You have to realize, okay, realize okay that is gone unfortunately but now we play against ace 10 pocket tens pocket aces lose four of spades lose four offsuit we never know and yeah we're in luck though that's it i fold and we get to see it yeah it's like like i want to talk about the range he's either wrapping those nuts fits to his to his image, or he has his once-in-a-lifetime bullshit. He's very, very polarized. Again, I would say he has exactly what he wraps. The way you lead up to the situation, it seems again, he's like, not again, but this time someone is full of shit. But yeah, or maybe he doesn't understand poker and is just overplaying his ace king and wants to get it in. Like, these are my three options, but I love the fold. So. All right. You have 30 seconds. Okay, we got, oh, no one got the first one right. Love it. No one, wait. I just lost my Kahoot. I just need it. You got it? I got it, yeah. All right, next one. Villain insta three bets, we fold and we see it. He shows me. Hit one time. It was really tough to figure out the potential answers here to have it balanced but i hope it's hidden well enough he showed me the ace queen got it showed it to me oh no you got it but like in a proud way that he thought this is value to easily get in yeah yeah and he was like sometimes you just have to be aggressive right and i'm like bro yeah sure you have no idea but so that's life poker for you guys you make reads you try to exploit to the maximum and you're the one being exploited i have a question here in the chat that i think is really good here from jerome Do you have any kind of question in your head when the situation shifts from let's go to let's go out like this? I still lose so much money when this happens sometimes, especially when tilted. And I think this is just very, very, very, very tough because it's really that we are in that mood. Please call, please call. But then we need to reevaluate every time. And there it helps a lot. Like the dice principle, know what you're playing against, right? When you speak it out loud, I check raise here to maximize my value because I want you to call down ace, king, ace, queen. So your brain realizes once that does not happen, oh, something is different. I can rule out ace, king, ace, queen now against thinking players. And then what is this new range and understanding i'm doing really shit against that so i'm just bluff catching and then we are in a situation okay bluff catch or not where in most cases the knot is the correct thing where i still think it doesn't make the fold bad because well we need to beat 50 of his value range i mean different odds but like we need to beat his value range. And even if he has worse hands, it's probably this play. I mean, yeah, who knows? It feels bad, but... I like the fold. I'm happy. And Jerome, I think what helps is to know that we're not the only ones that use the stack the fish sizings, okay? Sometimes it's being used against you. And I think it's really important to see if you're the fish that's being stacked right now and i specifically when i play against nitty opponents i have a strict no payout to nits rule like if it's a loose player i'm much more happy to be a little on the payoff side even if it's sometimes loose but i feel better for myself because i think in the end these people deserve the action but if they're a little nitty i'm too proud for that i don't want to give them my money because it's so hard to win back it's so hard to We'll be right back. feel better for myself because i think in the end these people deserve the action but if they're a little nitty i'm too proud for that i don't want to give them my money because it's so hard to win back it's so hard to win it back from them this is really good like talking about the player type as well like when i play like zoom 200 or anything else i have like even those stats like how often they win the river after they bet right so just like if we're having a value bet it should be higher than 50 it. It's not like they should have a hundred. And then I have people that oversample run around with like numbers in the seventies, which just means, well, I'm sometimes calling the freaking nuts. So you are even losing when you're value betting. So like 70 just means no, no, no, no bluffs. And then I don't need to look up any kind of pile and think like, this is the great blocker. It's like, no first step love catching, the bluff catching video again it's just like i like it there a lot just like first is there any chance he's over bluffing and then with that player type the answer is always no against a loose player type the answer is yeah maybe sometimes and then it's fine whether your catch is zero eb or slightly plus in the end as kai describes he earns it to get the action right because he has the bluffs and we don't want to let him run over us and if he has it this time he earned it right the next time he has a bluff again that's totally fine right actually when i play 5k nowadays it's like i have a couple of guys against those i bluff catch against some others not at all like even on 5k against rex we're like shout out to all our spanish friends here right Like who is it mr vicente delgado bison fish vits and fish whatever you want to call him pretty known player there he is like bluffing every single spot i can close my eyes i have a catcher click call because he's slightly over it in all spots i know every single catcher is slightly plus cb right so no way i fold even a good catcher and then there is someone shout out to our russian friends yeah hi mashko we're like i have a bluff catcher let's run let's get away maybe this was what's tucker saying here it's like i have that how you call that a vaga what is a vaga a scale a scale perfect like i have the scale here and we make the decision with our bluff catching we're like we can reward villain we're like maybe we reward his bluffs would look like this or we reward his value which is like this and somewhere balanced would be there think about like what do you want to reward some people who are not bluffing at all i take away where i really reward their bluffs which means i'm folding all the time like okay heing, so he doesn't get rewarded. And exactly what you mean, like don't pay off the nits. I don't want to reward the nits value bets. Like, oh, you played your set crazy. You went over bet turn, river all in. I had a good catcher with my top tier. No, this is not the thing, right? Like overfold, overfold, overfold. And then you make your money by them not betting often because they are not betting when they don't have it and so on. So this is really the scale in your mind. There is like you are deciding which player type gets the money. Here we folded against the knit. Apparently the knit is just so bad that he overplays his thin value, but that's part of it. All right. So that was the session on Tuesday. So that was the 1-3 kind of a nitty game, Tuesday night game. Now this is a hand out of a 2-5 Saturday night. Move up to where they respect our raises finally. Exactly, exactly. So this is the game that I usually like to play. And I usually like to play on a Saturday. It's the most fun. It's a lot of respectful trash talking like the Australians do. But banter, banter, fun, and everything you want want from a live game and there's a little bit of backstory to the person to the logec who's starting here with the iso against the limb so this guy i already thought that he was playing pretty well he had a couple of really aggressive moves and spots where i thought hmm that river for his range that could be a 200 percent overbet in this spot. And he then pulled out the 200% or 250% overbet, trying to really punish weaker ranges, being very aware of what's going on and what the ranges are like and ruthlessly going after the weaker recreational. So trying to kind of avoid, I didn't really play a lot of hands with him. Maybe it was just luck, but it felt like he was really targeting the weaker recreationals and then pounding on them aggressively when he felt like he had an advantage and they can't call however it didn't really work out well for him because he was down i think four stacks he got snapped off by weird second pass with overbet and was just not working out for him very well so i would say he was a little bit fuming or a little bit tilted because he did the right play but he just got snapped off by ridiculous hands which is why he now only has 485 dollars to begin the hand with and the last hand he lost was against the person who's limping here so i felt like there might be a little bit of tilt going on here trying to get back into the game or into the hand with this person here long introduction so for me my pocket sevens here i want to enter the pot right so i feel like there's potentially a world where i could just flat here knowing that i'm not really getting punished out of the blinds and maybe get the weaker player in there as well but i also feel like he's a little bit too loose with his eyesoring range here just by the way I perceived his state of play right now to be and I don't think that sevens isn't necessarily a bad three bet if I want a three bet cutoff versus hijack here it's probably on a low percentage play but in this case I thought I think I have a little bit of extra full equity here even though with the rake and everything I decided for the three bet here just to have the chance to play a heads up pot instead of the multi-way pot which is also not bad but i think both options are somewhat viable here it brings us back to our first limping spot in the end like how is the limping range structured is there only over calling happening after that is there a chance of re-raising right if there's only over calling happening i think flat happening, I think flatting is totally fine. Or is it more like first guy interested in the pot, second guy interested in the pot, and we are actually in a cold four-bet spot in a way, just with loser ranges. We're like, we are way more on the three-bet only or like four-bet only side there. It depends on how you define things for yourself. And yeah, I see reasons for both, depending on like, especially the limper I make my decision. Like the the way you describe the low jack i'm a little scared of facing four bats which obviously my hand doesn't want to see because we don't have like the stack to pot ratio anymore after those sizings to call off four bats really but yeah let's see so i also know that if i put myself into the position where i open up the action i know that i have to be ready to also play a pot where he's going to exert pressure on me. So I fully know that going into this hand, he takes the passive line and flats my three bet here. It's not bad if you hit a set by the way. So I feel like a lot of value comes from hitting sets these days. So he checks to me and yeah, I think we can split ranges here. There's a couple of hands that like to go larger here, but there's probably also a couple of hands that like to go with a smaller c-bet size. Sevens are probably the ones that would go great into a bigger size because you unblock the call down range. Yeah, you unblock a lot of hands that can call the larger size. However, I thought like I wanted to go with the smaller size specifically because this is a board where I think a good out of position flatter knows that there's some check raising going on against the smaller size here. And I kind of want to give him some rope. So even though I feel like usually if I have no clue, I would probably go 60% here, but in this specific scenario with him fuming a little bit, I decided to go quarter pot here just to give him some rope to build the pot. Okay. Let's just stop here because it's a very, very interesting spot strategically how to split up sizes, ranges there. If we put that in the solver, it will be a big size only, like big for like half pot, 60%, something like that, with normal 100 big blinds ranges. So your SPR is a little lower than that usually, so that allows us to size down a little. But I like the small bet just for the reasons mentioned, right? Life game is different. And as I try to play like one size only strategy in three bet pots in most spots online, just to be more balanced overall, and it's not giving up a lot of EV, I want to still explain what are the factors we think about when making that decision. You mentioned a couple of those already where like the one thing is always the advantage right now and not later, right? The vulnerable hands, those are the first ones that like prefer to get the money in now rather than later, right? Like pocket queens without a diamond are kind of the nuts right now or ready to stack off for that SBR. But if there is an eight of diamonds on the turn, if there is a king on the turn, if there is an ace on the turn, if there is whatever on the turn, that shifts. So they better get the money in now against pocket eights with a diamond, pocket nines with a diamond, against ace, jack, and so on. Better be all in because you won't stack up against that ace, jack anymore on a king turn. So this is the line, but what counts as well for even the invulnerable hands that we could talk about, like pocket sevens, let's say we have pocket sevens with a diamond. There's not much that can happen to us. We have pocket jacks. There's not much that can happen to us. So even those, they benefit from the bigger sizing in certain situations because you get value from hands. Like the one thing is that villain cannot like catch up with you. and the second thing is that you get value from hands that won't pay you later right i mentioned already the pocket eights pocket nines pocket tens with the diamond all of those you could have any gut shot but they won't pay anything on an ace turn king turn queen turn so it's actually two things make sure that well depends on whether a villain is likely to catch up with you or won't make a better hand this is bad for us and the other thing is for all our value hands or even for the bluffs whatever it's like are there hands that call now for sure but not later just building a pot in a situation that is very very favorable for you which we see on all the low boards like lower because our over peer advantage is quite big we have quite big. We have Queens, Kings, Aces, he not so often. So if the board is like seven, five deuce, that goes to the maximum. We even maybe almost range bets with the 75% sizing and like Jack high is still like Queens, Kings, Aces. And we connect a little with that with our bluffing range. So those are the two key factors to think about when we choose the sizing. But we play against someone aggressive we have a range that probably in his eyes doesn't contain anything like sevens because it's not like a real three betting range here with a limper involved so there is a big chance that people are going crazy if they are aggressive in the first place because we are perceived having ace king ace queen king queen and so on so i like to give some rope here to yeah let him hang himself thankfully villain helps us with building the pot a little bit he check raises here by the way it's just this is without the rake being deducted so it was a hundred dollar pot couldn't figure out how to do that here in the hand history so he check raises to 80 here which is probably fine from a sizing point of view i feel like what am i expecting to do that with probably a couple of suited connectors around the seven and the three so maybe something like four five if he has that maybe something like ace four clubs type of fan something that is more or less in the low card area between the seven and the three i don't think he would do that with all the 10 nines these type of fans because I feel like they're probably strong enough to also just check call here for that price and hands like four five or five six probably benefit a little bit more from falling on my ass king but that could be wrong I think he was a pretty aggressive player he could easily have like queen 10 clubs here as well so I just felt it incoming with a lot of his range you know how that is sometimes you just know that they're going to do it so maybe he wasn't playing his range he was just check raising 100% with his range so you feel it coming which is often like obviously you're biased and so on but it's a board that gives lots of opportunities right you see it in their face they are ready to do something but usually i mean no one will start with like ace five of spades here necessarily that's just not happening so we still need a board where villain has an option but here's the option maybe he's a little too light pre-flop and sits on king queen with the king of diamonds looks like a beautiful hand to check race right you have blockers you have backdoors you can talk yourself into it you have ace queen offsuit right you can talk yourself into it you have a seven you can take that as a blocker you have whatever right the queen 10 you have just a random flush draw obviously right you have the four five eight nine nine ten five six all of that you have pocket fours with a four of diamonds yeah we have so many opportunities that someone goes like yeah i've seen that somewhere before that this is like a five percent check raise the time, right? So, and this is such a beautiful board for that. Yeah. This is why it makes a lot of sense to give him some rope where for villain it's by the way, the right answer I'm saying in theory, our small sizing is wrong, but his correct answer would be to just call more and then go crazy on turns where he really improves is the turn of six, eight, nine, 10, four, hands then then he can start something but for now he has draws and draws only actually if we have pocket queens without diamonds our answer is the jam here it's like really killing all the equity things are not getting better for us and this is why check raising light against the small sizing here is actually incorrect but lots of people are still doing it i don't know if there's some merit in trying to go over the top here but i was in full give him some rope mode i think my sevens are just so strong and i don't really care about a lot of the runouts i think on most runouts i will have the nuts at the river so as you said with queens there's probably much more incentive to really go for it now and even take the fold if he folds fine but with the sevens i feel like maybe a little bit with the lookalike principle here in mind play it a little bit like seven eight if i have it or like a pocket eight you can even think about what can happen next do you benefit from him seeing more cards or is it always bad we're like pocket queens if villain folds you either fold it out a random flush draw you fold it out a gut shot you fold it out something that contains a king, that's 12% equity, something that contains an ace, another 12% equity. So you have an upside in the fold as well. So here, if you have pocket sevens and villain might be on something like king, queen offsuit, you have six outs to stack him just the other way around, right? You have the outs that you stack him and you don't care about diamonds because it's like, yeah, if there is a will blast it in right it's like sure if he has it he has it but that would be same result as if you stack off now so actually just calling is better and then yeah this is kind of the principle there yes exactly exactly let's get the king of clubs out now we got the four clubs so i mean it's not great right because we had five six we had like there's some five six it is a real possibility here so i'm not gonna lie and say that didn't cross my mind but it's villain's turn i thought like maybe he could even exert max pressure and just jam it because there's plenty of flush draws available to him but i also could see him maybe find a hundred dollar bet to extend it a little bit so these were the two things I thought about you know getting ready to see but it doesn't matter we don't have to talk about it because he came up with this size here and this was really interesting because it is I think you said it in one of the looms this is more like a check it's not really a real bet right so it is a bit of a check and this actually puts me into a weird situation here a little bit because i don't know if i want to raise a lot against that because i want to call a lot there's a lot of fans that now want to realize equity like i don't want to get jammed off my flush draw if i have it if i have ace queen of diamonds i'm just calling right there's no point in me just raising i take the good price and realize my equity and there's a couple of other hands that are happy to take another card if i have pocket tens for example something like that so i feel like there's a lot of hands that really want to call if i really want to raise this size it would put my hand my other hands in a weird spot if you know what i'm trying to say so it's weird it got me a bit off guard and i actually don't even hate his size because it's so weird to play against. It's just a check, but it's fucking up your brain, right? So if you face a check, what are you doing? I think I'm betting small. Right. So this is what we want to do. You still, you check back your flush draws. You don't want to get check jammed off your equity. But now the thing is that on very dynamic boards, everything we need is we want to have river nuts to be protected. But here, our pocket sevens will not often be river nuts. So this is not the one we need for protection. We can take to call off, we can check back aces with the ace of diamonds and ace of clubs if we want. We can check back our five, six of diamonds if we want, right? So pocket sevens will only be nuts on the river in like, I don't know, 40% of the cases or so. Every five, every six, every club, every diamond, everything changes. Now this is one of the hands that wants to get it in. In theory, we should actually just jam some flush draws ourselves. If he bets a little bigger here, I'm not a hundred percent sure. Where again, we have the cooler over cooler and cooler under cooler situation where we're just super happy to get in cooler over cooler. He might have seven X of something like that so i'm definitely raising here but it's a check and i'm betting small so i'm raising to like 75 or 80 or something like that i would have liked that like jamming is bad jamming no no i didn't jam i opted for the call so again i thought about this in hindsight i would like a small small raise but i was about what triggered that. Like this means something, right? This has to mean something. And I feel like this is not five, six of hearts. This is not five, six of, it may be five, six of clubs, like the super nuts. This is either super nuts or buying a card, usually. Buying a card, like eight, nine of diamonds, not ready to just rip it in. It can be four or five spades. Just like, yeah, get a call from more ace high, check down maybe. And like those type of fans you want to put into that. Yeah. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's a queen jack of hearts and he's crazy. Yeah. So in hindsight, I think I agree. I would like the small race. In that situation, I just thought because stacks are still in play. And if I call and give him some more rope to spaz off, I can still get the stacks if the runouts are good. And I still think I'm heroing a lot of flush runouts. Like I don't really care too much. This guy has shown to be like really prone and really capable of just hammering. Because what does he think I have, right? If I just call here, he will probably not put me on my pocket sevens and he will probably give himself a couple of outs jamming me off my hand on the river. Yeah, the thing is't need nuts to bluff catch right so your hand has so much value in raising now and if you want to say like to bluff catch him we can take any jack we can call like any kind of bullshit because they have the same value and pocket sevens they are way better now in raising compared to those hands so really this is the pattern of like yeah we like to bluff catch that this is no argument at all right we don't need nuts to bluff catch the only reasoning would be he can still improve to lots of second best hands it's like we benefit from checking back nuts now if there's a chance that he hits the queen and king river and then goes for thin value but that he wouldn't go against a stronger range or obviously we fold that out if we raise but this love catching with the nuts is never never never a good argument because well if you think he's bluffing enough take your freaking a7 suited call it done right yeah that's cool yeah i think the small bet caught me off guard a little bit fucked my brain up as he said yeah so nonetheless we go to the river which is a five i mean the good new series is doesn't really change too much because if he had five six before he has five six now and maybe he even had a pocket fives that improved just sometimes i don't know again we face the jam here yeah i mean we are happy we have a big smile on our face i mean it's no club it's no diamond and i don't care about the rest basically so The five is a reason for him to blast off, in a way, right? He's the out-of-position flatterer, could wrap at six. So that's the next Kahoot question. Obviously, not folding, and it takes me one second to put in my chips. And the next Kahoot question is, what did Villain show up with? Max Cezanne. Oh, that's unfair. Please not Max Cezanne. No, no i'm a little scared it's like when someone tells you a great story and then oh by the way there's no end like the last page out of the book is gone like it's like fuck it oh four people got it right yep it was the ace four of diamonds the buying a card Now you've got lucky that in his eyes, obviously his river gem is ridiculously bad, but this is exactly, whether you have pocket sevens or a seven now, no one cares, right? It's like you were bluff catching in a way. And this hand is happily stacking off, right? Against your pocket sevens. If you just raise, maybe he gems, maybe he calls. Anyways, he's investing more money. So really big learning here to not get fooled by those small bets. The tiny bet out of position is nothing else but a check so all your process should be what am i doing against a check we bet small so if it makes it 30 yeah we bet small let's make it 75 in your freaking face right and then i want to see him hang there with ace four of diamonds yeah as you said it meant something so once we have that read even I said it's either super nuts which is only one combo or two combos five six clubs diamonds or it's I want to buy a card I want to buy a card I want to buy a card which fits very well to that ace four of diamonds yeah well done four people got it right that's pretty cool we got two more let's rush through the next one yeah make sure to get the kahoot done yep all right another three bet pot this is also a very capable player different session a nice guy played a couple hands together i have my pocket eights here i want to play three bet only here i have no information about the blinds no isoing so just straightforward three bet my pocket eights here i probably folded also a decent amount of time due to the rake but this one i decided to go with and we hit the hit the ace-10-7 rainbow board, get checked to us. And here I kind of made a little mistake. I overestimated my own c-betting frequency a little bit. So I wanted to share that with you because it's probably something that a lot of other players would also get wrong. I know that there's a lot of checking going on here, but I just didn't know how much checking is going on here. So I thought I could bet like 70% or 80% of my range here, which is definitely not true. Looked it up. It was probably only 30% or something like that. Just a really high percentage of check behinds because we basically have a lot of second pass. Yeah. The thing is that where's our advantage gun that we had pre-flop it's Kings, Queens, Jacks, not an advantage at all. We've probably a little more ace King. And now we have the extra factor that this is 150 big blinds deep so sets even do matter a little more and he has tens and sevens very high frequency so that actually our ace king is not willing to go directional in it's like again think about the racetrack what's our pot size that we try to reach with ace king it's like yeah two big streets maybe something like that where ace high boards are a little dangerous and are not in like in single spots where we can just bet all the time because villain doesn't have ace king doesn't have ace queen offsuit and so on we need to be a little more cautious and actually i started checking back range on some really ugly boards like ace six seven with a flush draw something like that where i will show you like a 20 betting frequency but like every single hand is indifferent even the bottom set is indifferent to betting actually i think i mess up people's games plans even more with like a range check and then react to their sizing which is often face up because they are not correctly using 2e against the check and so on but yeah this one is a big mix we obviously have all the nice runouts for like our king queen king jack queen jack yeah we have 10x as nice blocker bluffs as well so we can navigate through but yeah yeah so this is something i would in hindsight do differently and probably check this one behind however we go with the small bet and hit a kind of a brick turn here so i think at this point i realized that i probably overdid it a little bit and i think that even if i bet correctly with the correct frequencies there's probably a lot of checking behind going on on this brick turn as well he basically narrowed down his range condensed it to good stuff and i still have a lot of my bullshit here maybe he knows that as well that i'm overdoing it so i feel like i have to check behind now i still beat some of the broadway draws here and the check behind here. And then this river is really interesting. That's the reason why I brought the hand up. I face another check. And here I was thinking, what is my weakest hand now in this spot? Right? So I know that I overdid it probably with the bet on the flop. But even let's say if I didn't overdo it, I feel like there's not a lot of non-pair hands here that are really garbage. So everything has at least a pair or something. And I do think that I have to start bluffing a couple of my pairs now if I have them and if I'm overdoing it a little bit as well. So when he checked to me, I felt like, okay, can I target something like queen, jack, queen, 10, king, 10 to make his life miserable? What kind of size would that be? What could I take with something like ace queen that i checked behind sometimes on the turn i felt like maybe a two-thirds pot value bet with my ace queen maybe some two pairs would be in order maybe even my straight to be honest i don't really want to go much bigger so i felt like a two-thirds size would kind of fit everything here and i decided to turn this one into a bluff yeah i like it a lot it's like this really being aware of our own range like would be great that you even know better what your turn bluffing range is that you say like okay i take the king queen king jacks with a spade i probably take the lowest pocket or the turn pier like your five six suited pocket sixes with a spade might be options to go bluffing so pit p even mentioning like it even looks like the eight nine which i think eight nine is not the high frequency thing we are having here so it's not that relevant but everything makes sense in a way he definitely has something like 10-9 he definitely has something like queen 10 he might have like an ace nine suited in his life he can have queen jack king jack but this is important for the sizing he can have all the nuts he can have eight nine he can have all king queens so it doesn't make sense to overbet or anything against that range so we have to fit everything together actually if we have king queen well we want him to have his bluff for example if we overbet he is fine with just calling the nuts himself so if we bet king queen and he plays correctly he should sometimes check race all in his queen 10 right so this is what our nuts want and actually this is a totally fine hand would be better to have pocket sixes or five six again if we don't bet it on the river just to unblock pocket eights and seven eights but i mean we cannot choose from too much we always have something on that board right we are not having king six of hearts here that would be a cool buff but we don't have that so yeah i like it so kahoot question a little easier one oh steffen yeah crushing crushing this does not look good man oh too good all right the other guys maybe have a chance now the question is we go for it and what does villain do snap call snap fall tank call tank fold i need my randomizer supposed to be a no race snap call tank call yeah if you have no clue you just should click faster i messed up he tank calls and showed the ace queen really had a tough tank and really felt not great about calling this because he also went through a couple of hands and he also said something like what are you bluffing here like what's your bluff so that kind? So that kind of made me feel good. And I really thought I would get it through because once they said, what are you bluffing? And then not saying anything, it feels like, well, then it's a fold, right? But he kind of felt like Ace Queen was just a little bit. He missed a value block bet himself. That's the risk we are taking. And then this was just him being married to his head, right? So actually, I tried to think it through. I clicked on on snap call i thought like it's either tank fold or snap call because i have an ace got you kid or it's like once you start thinking there's no reason to be calling anymore like if you played live games before if you start thinking you don't find the bluffs so yeah like ace nine suited i think he ends up falling with ace queen whether there's reasoning, it just feels better. Or it's like you might be value betting the same hand, right? Which is absolutely true. I mean, we are betting ace-queen here. And he just missed the block bet for value himself. It's fine. And now I guess someone catched up if we have three answers. I'm too scared to click next hand because I don't want to start the next question. So this is the last question. And this is also one that I also messed up a little bit. And I want to share that with you because it might help some of the other people who are listening right now. So this is a hand also very different session. Again, I opened my ace queen and get three bet by the hijack. And my history with the hijack was that he was the type of person that shows you at the table when he folds a good hand, that guy that just bumps you and say, look what I what i'm folding here so he did that to me a couple times i try not to react on it because you know show one show all but i had some information here that he actually folded pocket queens against the i think it was a cold four bet in a pre-flop scenario where he just mucked it so the correct fold basically but very capable of laying hands down and that was my only read basically had a big stack and yeah, my ace queen off here. I don't want to call this one. So I felt like I either four bet bluff here or I fold. I'm not sure what the stack depth changes here, but I just feel like there's too much things that can go wrong with this type of hand, flooding it, which is, I went for the four bet here. Also because I had a pretty tight image, didn't really do a lot here. So I felt like the dynamics, yeah, I can throw in a four bet every three hours, right? So I threw it in here and we get called. One thing I want to add here is really because the stack that is important. So ace queen offsuit is one of the standard four bets for a hundred big blinds here for mainly three reasons. One reason being just having blockers against continuing range. So we maximize hold equity doing then second doing well and this is what i have to split up in two reasons doing well against villains calling range because he should be flatting pocket jacks pocket tens some random king queen suited stuff like that ace jack suited we actually dominate that partly and that comes together with the fact that villains should mainly be jamming ace king off off-suit. So in a way, we prepare ourselves to, well, if he jams, it's fine, we fold. But if we get to play a four-bet pot, we can discount ace-king. Like he should flat it like 25% of the time, but mainly get it in. And this changes deeper. So now he probably has ace-king, or this player might even have it for 100 picks because he's too scared. he has ace king 100 in his range and what i switch then is that i actually go down to a very non-intuitive four betting range which is something like the mixed pair folds like pocket eights pocket nines pocket sevens like maybe even five six six seven suited to just say like okay i know you're freaking just calling ace king offsuit and i want to play against that and against other like high card boards i have the full equity against your jacks tens anyways it's not like we are getting into small pots and to showdown where i lose a pair of sixes against your pair of tens so this is where for betting ace queen offsuit is actually dangerous for that stack death it's like it's dangerous when you hit when you don't hit you have the perfect one to smash it. Right. So that's kind of something that is important to have in the back of your mind. Yeah. Didn't really feel well. Once we called, I felt like, oh shit, here I go again. So we kind of get a board where I think for a hundred big blinds, we can probably get away with a very high percentage. Seabedding frequency, I go something like 25%, probably range to be honest. Maybe I'm overdoing it a little bit but yeah i mean in this case i want to put pressure on tens jacks queens right away and i feel like i don't have to bet a lot to do that because he knows that this game will go on and you know two or three streets so i think a small bet is fine to accomplish that goal of maybe even getting some full from pocket 10s against the tighter opponent here. Absolutely. Usually he doesn't have ace-king often, so it's really a nice spot for us now. We run into all kinds of ace-kings and we get still those folds. If you have ace-queen of clubs, ace-jack of diamonds, we unblock all that. So having the ace of spades to block a little something to have some kind of navigation is even nicer. Maybe we don't want to go 100% but yeah that's definitely a hand that i'm betting just every time yeah and i felt like having those suits i wrote them down specifically it gave me a little bit of an idea that could be a couple of blast offs coming in so i was kind of happy that i couldn't really punt a lot in this flop scenario so really happy to put in the 60 not really happy that he calls but we have to expect that a couple of times. And now there's a Kahoot question. Please rate this turn card. Okay. This is the next Kahoot question for everyone. It's the 10 of diamonds. Come on, Tucker. I know you can do it. I want to give you the Discord Nitro. All right. Rate the turn. I want to click on green. I could be wrong, Stefan. I don't have a lot of options. It depends on like his three flop range. So we both don't know. I don't even know what ranges to put into Pio. So it's a bit of a trick question, but I looked up a couple of similar spots and the 10 is just so freaking bad. And I wasn't even aware of that because it is actually, if you scroll down per EV on that card, it's the lowest ranked EV and equity card for my range that I put in. So it is the 10 of diamonds and the 10 of clubs. They are the lowest rank. And for some reason I thought, oh great, I have a gut shot. That was my initial reaction to it. And this is why I show this hand because I got lost in the sauce a little bit. I saw my hand. It was already a big pot. I felt like I have a gut shot. Maybe he folds whatever he can fold now. Pocket 10s has a set. Probably not going to fold in that. Jacks can't fold. Queens probably. I don't know. But I didn't think about that. I just put out a bet. And this is what I hate. Like, I think I should just never really bet this hand. You start the hand with, like, he makes tight laydowns in your hand, right? Where, like, I mean, to make this plus CV, we need the ace-king folds, which is very, very ambitious that thing of like yeah we had a great spot we went for it we might blast here with the ace of spades but maybe next time and then let it go at least we get the snap race here so i get to save face okay so i get to save face now for two minutes and showed him how you lay down your aces i believe you sir i believe you sir show the one ace and yeah let's see who got it right allocator oh oh stefan did you do it yeah obviously the worst possible ah you did it i think i don't count so congratulations tucker you should get the discord nitro i didn't read it all through he like already deserves it for the work on the double flush draw boards. He put in the strategy channel. Make sure to check that out. So whether you get it for your second place or for your nice work there, you can choose. I think, Kai, you talk to Hannes. I'll let him know. I can hook you up, Tucker. Well-deserved. And I hope you guys enjoyed the questions and I hope you had fun. I was kind of unsure what to pick. It was a bit all over the place thanks jeff for taking the time by the way it was quite some time thank you for that sure no worries so really enjoyed it i like the format a lot a little more casual talking having the chat on the side for next time we definitely figure out how to get the zoom chat working as well and then yeah so big shout out to you kai again for like qualifying in a way with your awesome looms in discord. Maybe for everyone who didn't check that out, really, really interesting stuff there, really high level stuff. And your chance, I'm still looking for someone next month. So in two weeks, we have the Twitch coaching, the free coaching. I told Fedor I'd take over. So no clue what to talk about to all the donkeys joining there. Let's make sure you guys are there to shine a little in a bright light. And then we'll a casual session like this one again in four weeks maybe i cannot guarantee everything the projected birth date of my son is august 11th so i'm not sure i will plan like august mid of august but who knows this is not in my hands whether i can be there then so it might be on short notice and yeah i will definitely reach out to one of you guys. So whoever shines rather bright in this sport gets my invitation. And I hope some of you are ready to have like something similar like that, or you can choose the topic or just everything. Maybe some online session next where we go through hands. I like it a lot. Let's wrap it up here. Thank you so much, Kai. Yeah, thanks for having me. And if your kid comes a day late, he has the best birthday august 12th he should aim for that that's the one let's try this one one day late perfect hey guys cheers thanks for joining early let's talk in discord cool see you later bye bye
