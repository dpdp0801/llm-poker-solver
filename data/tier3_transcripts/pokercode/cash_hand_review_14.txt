### TOPIC: cash hand review 14
 So hello. Hello, hello. Hello, we have Tucker with me today, if you haven't seen him before, which probably is the case. Don't mix him up with Simon just because of the beard. Well, one goes, another has to join, you know, you need a man with a beard. Yeah, all right. The Lithuanian laser, I love it. All right, so where's the chat actually? I was just telling how bad I am with all that. Hey, Jeremy. Hey, Damon. Hey, Jerome. Kairudi, let's go, my favorite people. Yeah, everyone. I'm like Mario Pallua. I haven't seen you so far. So great to have you here. Micha with two A's. Pavel, Jerome again. Jerome keeps chatting. The Lithuanian laser. Okay. Luke, obviously. Adan. Let's go. Awesome hands. Let's hide those. Let's hide hands. And actually I have lots of stuff on this screen screen. So if you see me, keep watching me, like looking at the other side. This is all hidden because we'll try to let you guess a little again and not share too much. And yeah, I can tell you so much already that the Lithuanian laser did a great job preparing that session with very, very nice hands. And our goal today is to figure out where we like aggression so all those hands are about aggression about river raises turn raises and so on how much we like them we are talking about bluffs so we are not like i think i mean i know it i had a horrible session yesterday and i felt they're like i never have it and this is what we are facing here like which are the spots we go for which not for all the tournament players out there i can tell you already we can forget balance in those spots so you can go for them if we decide that they are good you can go for them 100 out of 100 times it's a shame i can't change my nickname on yeah i could make it later oh later. Oh, yeah. All right. Four plus three, we got 20 people in here. So no, Kahoot today will use the chat. I actually searched for a function because I'm just looking for ratings from one for like, that's garbage. Or you can give it a zero as well, up to 10 for like all day long. And I bet my house and my car key on it. I didn't find a tool within Kahoot where you can just share thoughts and we have like an average or like a spread or something. We just go with a freaking chat. Do you have a view here? Yeah. Unfortunately, that's not anonymous. So we will all see who pumps. That's more fun. I guess we are ready to start, right? You're ready, Tucker? Yep. The test I use sometimes kind of help me decide on my place, especially like if I make a mistake or I think it's a mistake. The thousand times, if I do the same basically every single time, so that's what I put in the slide. Not a rating, but if I just do it every time or not. Maybe you just present yourself for a second first. Not everyone knows you, so what are your games? What is your poker background? You can tell us about your hobbies and your pets as well, whatever you feel like. So I started playing full-time four years ago, left the UK, got back to Lithuania, and started at 15 now, I think, when I quit my job, and then kind of stuck at 200 for maybe two years. I wouldn't say stuck. I just, my shot didn't work out, but it's kind of there's something missing. I think some of these hands, I'll add my comments then then but i think it shows the type of mistakes they make when i'm not playing let's say we're still working on crushing 200 right that's like we're not stuck we're like yeah yeah let's yeah let's let's view it that way and it's a lot of like sometimes autopiloting and some of these decisions are when they think about them i think it's very clear not to give away something not to not to do it But in game, it's, oh, you know, this is what a strong player would do or that type of shit, I think, which is sometimes it's not necessary. And like maybe to round that up there, the hands we're looking at today are all, we're like, we are not discussing any PIO solution. We are, maybe I pull up, I didn't plan on that, but let's see whether I pull up some GTO wizard and so on. But we are in the dark streets here, right? In the dark streets of what's the capital of Lithuania? Vilnius. Vilnius? Vilnius, yes. Yeah, so like this is where we are at right now, where Vilnius potentially shows us like weakness and not like we are on the river or the turn and we are not facing balanced ranges.'s the big point so looking at payo and how payo would play doesn't make any sense at that point right this is where we follow our pattern what would be right it's still great to understand that what is villain doing wrong he's freaking weak he's bluff heavy he never has it whatever and what is our exploit sometimes it is aggression and sometimes it is the overfall and this is what we try to figure out a little what is the logic behind it this is how i see things here when we think about aggression on the river Thank you. sometimes it is the overfold and this is what we try to figure out a little what is the logic behind it this is how i see things here when we think about aggression on the river i think about villains reaction and this is split into three parts all right so first i've shown you that so often already right first part is snap calls or even re-raises villain we don't see your screen stefan sorry we? We don't see your screen. Oh, that's a good point. I was actually like expecting more vibes. I just opened up. That should be good. Yeah. All right. So we have the snap calls. We have the bluff catchers, right? That is like the volatile thing. People can call, people cannot call. Sometimes they realize they have bluff catchers. Sometimes they don't even realize and they have the snap folds so whenever we think about let's say raising or betting or whatever this is the investment opportunity we are having and it's our job to evaluate and how can i make this disappear can you please disappear oh nice i can just pull it cool and this is like on us to find out where those lines are right for example this line might be that villain is value heavy whatsoever and he doesn't have any snap folds because he's not bluffing maybe this is a bad spot maybe villain is capped and doesn't have a single snap call then he has lots of love catchers or we can have an idea how he will treat his love catchers right how will he fold them will he call them and to represent our bet size is depending on the bet size we are using we need villain to fold a lot or not much right if we use like a four times pot over bet we need them to fold 80 that's a lot he needs to fold all bluff catchers maybe. If we only block that smallish or like put out a 10% bet, he never needs to fold. And just if he folds like some of his give ups, that's already enough to print money, right? And there's lots of stuff in between, obviously. So we have to take into account all those things. And we try to get away from those hands, from absolute hand strength and so on, and really see those spots as investment scenarios have that picture in our mind. And now let's freaking go. So hand number one, I'll open up the chat again if there's anything going on. Do you want to share screen? Absolutely. Cool. And the first hand is King seven of spades. So I have a nice presentation. Tucker, I will show that to you after the hands were looked at and I have all the hands here and I just have to look for King seven of spades. I hope the results are not shown obviously. And I make this big here. I hope we can see that. You confirm that? Is that good? Yeah. Okay. The old race king seven suited from the hijack. Small blind flats. Big blind flats. We have a freaking flush draw. Someone donks. Okay. We go with the call. I think the race is fine also. Whatever that means. Willem bets third pot again. We could race with some some hands probably not this one too often call river is a freaking queen and villain blocks again and now let's let's just start off with the rating and i want to know from you guys how much you like this raising opportunity we are not thinking about the call it's really from a zero out of ten up to a ten out of ten yeah how often do you want to raise that spot how do you like that spot and so on one two nine eight eight so see ya out of 10 up to a 10 out of 10 yeah how often do you want to raise that spot how do you like that spot and so on one two nine eight eight so see i love that how like some people are like let's freaking go and some others are like no never never ever never siberino mtt world goes with a 15 okay he's facing more players flatting the small blind and then donking randomly okay and And i gave my rating as well we'll look at it in the end and now maybe yeah you just give us your thoughts what you thought maybe in game and what you think now i think my thoughts are in game and now are the same so i'm happy with his hand yeah i think up till the river i just basically played my hand have a cheap price and call and see what he does. On the river then he bets the size, I think I already had marked as a recreational so I give more weight that basically his size just means strength, representing the strength of his hand. So just basically sitting on some random 10, 6, Jack, Ace, Ha, you know, basically not very strong hands and I think all of them, best case scenario, all of them fold, except maybe Jack or some random rivet queen. And worst case scenario, very, very stationary. And he doesn't believe in calls a bit like 10-9 type. But then I know next time and attack him. So I love his bluff every day. Questions about the size, how much to invest to make him fall back? so i mean pretty clear explanation what we expect villain to be doing we have no clue but it's like a random guy donking out of the small land three way which usually means i have a little piece of that board and then like sticking to that small badass is that this can be a random 10 this can be a jack this can be a random flush draw which we block obviously that makes it maybe not perfect this can be maybe a random queen maybe playing king queen like that but three streets right we need to evaluate three streets there is a double flush draw on the turn and he bets small all the time this is just the opposite of strength this is like i have bullshit but i want to see one more card i have bullshit i have a little something like all the way while his small block that gives us a raising opportunity here we don't need to represent a flush here we can still have king queen we can have ace queen we can have ace king we can have queen jack we can have queen 10 we can have 9 8 we can represent the freaking world here like i was not talking about any hands that we would be raising turn necessarily. So yeah, I think it's a very good spot. It's not the perfect hand, just like we're missing some of the snap falls. Like he might have seven, eight of spades that we are unfortunately blocking. He might have king five of spades himself, no clue what he's blessed. It obviously makes it slightly worse if we just look at our investment scenario, but let's see, this is pretty much summarized what you just said, right? Best case. And this is maybe a very nice pattern that I asked Tucker to work with, to evaluate those attempts, go with the best case and worst case scenario. And often, I hope you felt that as well. Once you just write it down, it is very clear how good or bad that spot is. Often the best case is printing and the worst case is break even and sometimes the best case is break even and the worst case is donating right so here it's like really the worst case is there a worst case that he calls everything i don't think so yeah i i had to work on worst case because even if you call the 10 it's not it starts this small investment relatively and we know he's not folding anything so we can get value later. Yeah, it's not really worst case. So yeah, absolutely agree. You say like, okay, a thousand times, that's your way of taking it. Yes, I tried to rank it from zero to 10. I gave it an eight because I love that spot, but I like discounted kind of two points for like each card that is not perfect in our hand, right? If we sitting somehow on pocket deuces i rated a 10 out of 10 this is just having the seven of spades makes it slightly not perfect the king of spades slightly not perfect this is why i ended up with an eight but i tried to be like everything above five i love going with it and below five still means i might go sometimes with it maybe Maybe like from zero to two is the never, never. As long as there is a straight possible. As long as we go smallish to be fair, it's tough for you to actually be bluffing here. So if he calls a hundred percent with random catchers, should turn out to be fine in the long run anyway. Absolutely, right? The worst case I think is still decent. Worst case, let's say this is a slightly losing race. And yeah, like something like bluff free raises and so on. I think we don't, like Willem tells us weakness. That's freaking it. Thank you. Worst case, let's say this is a slightly losing race. And yeah, like something like love free raises and so on. I think we don't, like Millen tells us weakness. That's freaking it. How large are we raising? I have a 50% button for that. I have a 50% hotkey, a 75% hotkey, a 150% hotkey, and a large all-in button. And this year it's just, I have random, I play against random, I raise smallish. I raise to like, let's say 50% would be like 40, 42 here. Not nailing it. I think I clicked 50% button or something. That looks like it. Yeah. Getting it through, right? When you see hand histories on my screen, they will always be an end. I hate giving those private coaches who are like, I was interested in spot, which is obviously better. And then goes to the next hand. We get the fold. All right. That first one first out of i think 11 or 13 something like that 13 12 12 oh damn it you made this nice looking opening page that distracted me here the exactly that's why it's 13 slides okay so hand number two is the freaking queen six of hearts let's see when you guys have any questions, just feel free always to put them in the chat. Something like that, I won't look up in the solver because it just doesn't exist. But if I have to draw something like this here for that one, I think this is what I would represent it. Like Willem has garbage in his range. So I expect that there are some snap folds and some snap calls. Does he play flushes like that? Is it strength? I don't think so at all. And our raise is something that needs a fold equity that is like 50%. It's like, how much fold equity do we need? Like 33%. It's a raise. We risk 42 to win like, what was it? 48. fold equity once he starts folding something we are printing if he only folds his snap folds it's slightly minus if he folds his catchers and he might not even realize a jack or a 10 is a catcher then we can print it so i would make a line for best case it's really this area here is what is our EV. This is the best case. And the worst case green doesn't look good for losing, but okay. It's like that area, right? This is like how I see that in my, in my mind. Montas, you're just in time for a hand number two, and we are super hyped for seeing your rating for this potential river bluff. All right. So we have a queen six suited standard open race 2.5x we can go with multiple sizing plans here i mainly go with a small range bet on that board so yeah so far so standard we could be crazy and just say our six deuce of hearts and the queen deuce of hearts blocker is freaking crazy and we go with our over card and over bet that board it is definitely an option but the check is very fine as well so just saying like looking at the properties of that hand it's like it's a little it's not like bullshit and the river is a freaking king so obviously we are c betting lots of kings on the turn we won't be c betting a lot of kings so actually we river that king quite often and we'll block bets so everyone i want to see a number and i'm like mantas this is your job now yours is double the value so a number between zero and ten how much you like that potential river bluff or you call no river bluff here a four a three two four an eight six six twelve where's mantas mantas gives it a six okay seven nine four eight okay actually i want to look this one up all day long all right so i would like to have a discussion going here actually about this very different number so no one says it's two we have some like very high numbers that want to go all the time and some like it's like okay ish but not really cool and yeah maybe tucker you give us some some insights maybe talking about what you like about that hand as well i mean you went for it or what gives you a good reason that this is a nice hand to go with or not while i'm looking a little for a pile input as well okay i think the main thing they like is that there's a lot of auto vaults which I know Kai said we can beat some, but I don't know. I don't think I can make this call. If I don't think I had many reasons, so it's mainly many auto folds. I also expect the range. I think it was a red not to be super protected by very strong hands. That's my assumption. Obviously, that's the base case. And it's a lot of like 8x that hits their life. So auto-falls and a lot of catches with very little nutted hands in there. We have auto-falls. First of all, absolutely. Villain has 7-9. Villain has 9-10. Villain has queen-9. Villain has 10-7. Villain has 4-5 of diamonds. We're not blocking anything of that. Villain shouldn't bluff queen 10 here. I think queen 10 is too strong, so actually our queen doesn't matter for that instance. We don't block diamonds. We don't block spades, so just like backdoors that he might float a little lighter, which is just all freaking good. And this is just the snap folds, which tells us the worst case of our potential bluff is not bad at all right even if he just folds the snap folds that's good and then the second thing what about his kind of value hands that are buff catchers now once we race does he have a good reason to snap them off all day long like i don't think so at all and what you said as well i believe very strongly in that that this is not being protected like that someone goes for the block bet with a deuce x to re-race those guys i mean way too scared that people are not capable of raising the king often enough so it's like they go for the check large race if they want to do that something like that and there is not much deuce x there is not even traps going on really so yeah i'm actually on the very high number here. Do we expect Willem Bluff small with 9-7? Absolutely. Just get out some bullsh**. Yeah. Kai's point is interesting. I don't have a read. If you bet an eight, the guy- Looks like king-queen? Our race looks like king-queen, I hope. Like his small bet doesn't look like king-queen at all. Right. So actually like GTO wizard is mainly using the big sizing on that board, which I'm doing a lot for some reasons. Unfortunately, not a really relevant game tree. This is what sucks a little about GTO wizard that it's just like sticking to its sizes instead of allowing some fanciness here and check, check to still see some kind of button where I think that again an eight is rather thin to block bet that's correct like if he has pocket nines that would be something and yeah actually right now even the block bet does not exist because jack wants to go bigger and eight is not strong enough it's a mess because it's a non-existent game tree that's why i'm not necessarily showing it right now and then it's like we have some folds some raises and yeah actually like for those reasons it's very certainly not the piro play but i'm loving it for those reasons this is the game tree and this is what we are working with here can someone tell me how to not have that yeah full height here and what we see like actually a queen six is okay a queen five would be better for some reason whatever but it's just like it's showing okay we need stuff like that as our raising range and well we could now double check on let's say we race to this number here what villain needs to call here right he needs to first of all snap call every freaking jack why is he re-raising okay this is because of that yeah that's the problem now that this actually does not really exist you can click on normalized normalized shows a bit more hands normalized yeah okay so first he needs to call every freaking jack and he's just allowed to fold the bluffs and the rare ace eight we're like i'm folding in the real world if i take this line as the big blind with my jack against like 90 of the players i'm snap folding my jack all day long i'm sizing river slightly bigger but anyways we're like i think this is a great great great spot where yeah that's just the thing we unblock the bluffs so this gives us a really really we talked about multiple things let's draw that graph here we have infinite snap folds i think it's very likely that villain is even bluff heavy here all right so we have those snap folds and we said it's very likely that he's not too protected taking the deuce into the block bet into re-raise that's not many combos so it's like i make a very very small line for that and again we are just representing a king we are not using a large sizing so we need like some fold equity like that right where again we have the potential upside potential upside like that that we win this cv that villain might be over folding if he even folds a jack like i would against most players or the downside that villain just folds his snap folds and we lose kind of this part here like expecting that villain doesn't take his 9-7 to block re-raise right then he wouldn't be folding this part either but I think this is very safe to assume so again a small spot that I like we're actually here if you look atai, I don't care about the hand choice there at all because this year, whether we take queen five, queen six and whatsoever, it's just a reaction to villain's perfect bluffing scenario, right, and blockers and so on, where we are in a game tree where villain shouldn't use that size too often at all, right? We're like, where is this small bet? bet it's just jack five this is why the queen five is a little better than the queen six i guess and that's about it so it's kind of real bullshit and obviously people have some tells people it's just weakness or it's just like random hands that they take obviously people play jack six and jack five exactly the same way and don't play that mix so this is something where we need to look away from the solver and make up the mind ourselves a little like that and i hope this really showcases i'll bet if your tucker got snapped off we've already seen that you obviously got it through because people are always folding here needing less than 50 fold equity for everyone struggling with the red line that's one easy thing where your hand does not matter actually i'm sure that like having hearts is slightly better i think not having a 9 10 or 7 in your hand is slightly better but write that down for your next session try to do that two times button versus big blind versus an out of position float against the block bet do it two times in your session hand doesn't matter and you're a way tougher player to play against because you're definitely forgetting those bluffs and the frequencies here. What's the best case? Villain is not protected and block betting range that folds very frequently with auto folds in place, right? He has the auto folds, tries to go for a cheap bluff and is only block betting like weak hands and probably betting a king a little bigger. The worst case is we see a villain play very well, kind of, right? Constructing this range well as catching correctly. This already tells me, okay, our bluff will be zero EV. If like worst case is villain plays like payo, that means our bluff will be about zero EV. So there's actually a huge upside without a downside. I go for the freaking 10 out of 10 here. I think population bluffs with bigger size, I don't think, I mean, that's a different assumption. I think they do that on brick cards. I don't think that they do that on a king that hits us, but we just snap off every king. But if the river is a six or a five, I'm with you, Montas. On that king, I just don't see it. If you think that villain has the bluffs and the bigger size absolutely you go for it but then it's tough to represent stuff right it's just i'm raising a king here so i can represent something i'm raising every king against that size very important to do that as well even though you can sit there with king five and tell yourself villain is never ever calling something worse but like at least give him the chance right we've seen he should call every jack but yeah i believe a lot in overfolding here on all kinds of stakes okay and number three i need to speed up a little okay hand number three is a bigger one lots of text let's see but if we beat all snap folds anyways why not only invest the 2.87 well i'm just talking about the spot here the queen six maybe villainous bluffing queen nine that would suck right then we just split queen 10 then we just split so if i have ace high i highly consider the call next hand is a freaking king queen okay this will be huge for you guys cut off open raises we defend the big blind We face a c-bet on the Q97 board, we call obviously. Turn is a 5. Brick, I mean we have some 6-8, we should check raise that sometimes, but besides that it's like not giving us many two pairs. Yeah, 150% overbet by Willem. Have a good one, Yabchoo. And we have another standard call, I say and the river is the eight of clubs and villain bets again and obviously hero thinks about jamming first thing i will have a couple of questions first thing is what's your rating for river jam here zero to ten we have a 2, we have a 10 from Sebarino. Okay, we have a two. We have a zero, another zero. An eight, four, two, two, two, three, eight, four. His sizing is just never a flush. Okay. Let's go with a 10. Sebarino, what do you think his range is? How does it look like? How is it like? Give us a structure of his range. Sets? sets set straight and falling to any race i think okay that was my logic not many flushes and uh jack 10 and some thin sets straights basically sets feel thin somehow ace queen offer okay ace queen would be an insane value bet ace queen definitely not part of like there is a one part straight and a flush and like there was a turnover bet and everything gets there don't think he folds the big straight okay so if you guys need to draw this year how would it look like let's kill this year where is the line no snap folds kai says no snap folds not sure what other bluffs we want to you're a tournament Who cares? Who freaking cares whether we have bluffs or not, Severino? It's about the spot itself here. Does our bluff make money? So, okay. Severino, how many snapfalls? How many snapfalls? You're with Kai and say zero? Adan says zero. Okay. That sucks. How many snap calls? Very few snap calls Okay, alright Then let's have a look at our jam We have the option to risk 280 To win 140 That needs to work 70 freaking 5% of the time Which means, okay, he calls a snap calls only a few, but we need him to fold like, let's say 60, 70% of his love catchers. Right? So this is like the first 20, 30% of snap folds are just missing here. Now this next question, maybe for you, Tucker as well. Why do you think I'm so convinced that there are no snapfalls first of all his line like bed big over beds is very hard to have air and plus i think he replied to one of the posts recently and one in the past of mine when people use this go crazy and then use a small bat on the river kind of baiting you to do something it's not only the line it's actually the pattern on all streets, right? Which obviously is the line, but I want to emphasize that a little. So we start on the flop. We have a three quarter C bet on that flop, which is like the strongest thing you can have. This is what people do with sets. This is what people do with pocket Kings. This is what people do with flush draws. This is what people do with good hands. People are not betting this sizing with ace five of hearts, right? So first thing, so he has a set, he has an over pair. He has a top here, or he connects well with the board, which can be a straight or a flush draw term. Same thing. He over bets can be something that couldn't like still very, very value, or he connects well with that board. Like he has a good draw. He has like whatever. Maybe a bluff like king of clubs 10. Oh, unfortunately, he cannot have that. So yeah, I mean, we are kind of calling here because king queen can value bet in his shoes. And now this year, everything gets it. What is our calling range? We have something like king queen and ace queen and besides that we have seven acts of clubs five acts of clubs some monster draws some ace acts of clubs that's freaking it what is our calling range and two pairs and everything gets there we might even have a freaking six year right so and now what villain decides to do i hope this question is not for me kai kai is asking why he can't have flushes and this is my point here as well that tucker just mentioned as well he goes huge huge and now in position when we hit freaking everything we just hit the world here this is the gym card for us we could start a donking range here as the big blind not necessarily but like in similar spots then he sizes down and there's like two intentions that this can be Thank you. start a donking range here as the big blind not necessarily but like in similar spots then he sizes down and there's like two intentions that this can be intention number one is thin value but i don't find a hand maybe the straight to get paid by a six or to get paid by a set like which we would fast play before or whatever and the other thing is to make sure every freaking flush raises like this is what we discussed in discord as well where i'm freaking scared here if that was the seven of clubs here on the river and he sizes down i put him 100 freaking percent on a boat it's just this yeah i bet smaller to make a flush race where i mean i, I know the result of that hand, but it's like, you can trust me that I'm not results biased here. Daniel obviously nailed it here that it's just exactly that. That's a downsize when there could be still a raising range. Yeah. I mean, what is kind of working here? Pretty hard for us to find bluffs. So it looks pretty strong. If we raise, do we consider that? Or is that just too small of a factor here? I think we just don't find folding ranges here. Thank you. in here pretty hard for us to find love so looks pretty strong if we raise do we consider that or is that just too small of a factor here i think we just don't find folding ranges here we need him to fold 75 of the time to get like i mean what should we have we have mainly flushes we have freaking flushes all the time here and yeah he knows that i think a jack 10 without clubs can be a check back here actually it's kind of a fishy thought as well to bet small with the super nuts which i see a lot like the weaker the player the smaller they bet they're super nuts just to be sure for me it's so important to not have the read here right reads are tough to make and if you like don't have the experience and you don't read strength into that it's this year what i want to show you this is our investment scenario right we all agreed on him not having snap folds he showed strength over three streets he has something maybe we don't know whether he has the nuts very often right with that exact sizing what i actually think like i actually am pretty convinced that this is about like this right that he has the freaking nuts about 50 of the time and then some jack tents well like then we're talking about really burning money but still this is our risk reward scenario where our worst case is having zero percent fold equity because there are no snap folds and regarding those people talking about no bluffs we have freaking ace queen with the ace of clubs that feels like the most standard jam of all times which i'm not doing it as we're like uh yeah and we need to see the jack ten of clubs obviously it's really that it's such a different price that we are giving ourselves it's so freaking much to not win a lot in this spot so it's it's maybe i wrote that in one of the discord posts lately as well where how we want to play like let's say up to mid stakes even on high stakes where it's like we want to put aggression into place when there are wide ranges people are overfolding when things get nutted people are actually like kind of sticky right if he has five six of clubs here he would be indifferent in theory against our gen like no freaking way people are over folding like they're flushes so yeah maybe now let's just i want to have a quick look at gto wizard here as well so what was that not big one that cut off. Pretty nice tool when actually... You can do it deeper because we are 160. You can do 150. Oh yeah, nice. Let's take 150. Whatever the rake structure is, we raise. Big blind, we call. Flop was, I forgot already, queen, nine clubs, seven diamonds. Queen, nine, seven. All right. So we so we check villain has multiple betting options he chose the not the overbet but like this 4.1 where it's already yeah his bluff would be something to have this well a seven foot a six of diamonds in there a six of hearts in there i just don't see people that big with that because they still use the small bet also we obviously have a pretty clear call here call turn was the five hearts i guess yeah check and then we face the 150 doesn't exist so we take the 17.1 which obviously is the main sizing here we are already indifferent actually with our king of clubs right here we have the issue that our king of clubs is not worth anything it's just blocking villains gloves like king 10 offsuit interesting i love that fold i run this on a solo we can node lock because i had read this guy over bets only high equity hands so either nuts or draws and then you can put that range in that if he goes to 0.1 or like even, even tinier. So I think I just fold the turn. It's even the best play I could make in the turn. Yeah. I like it. It's like my head tells me, okay, he can value that King, Queen himself. But like then actually evaluating that the King of Clubs is a very bad card. And our money mainly comes from Monster Frost that he gives up on the river. This is a big difference. And then the eight of clubs. I was actually not too wrong that there might be some donking. So yeah, where's the check now? And Willem's sizing pattern. There's 47 in the middle. He obviously never uses the very small bets. If you click space, it will change the sizing so you'll show your percentage. one more time yeah so now you have both you see that oh this is cool okay we have a pro here i'm just still new to this so we see like okay what is bet 29 we're like pocket seven this is what he needs to find the sevens with the club it's like his thin value that he's allowed to be going for but like this is what we try to fold out right it's like and i mean are people betting that or are they just scared of us having flushes only right the jack 10 offsuit without clubs maybe and then okay let's say they take this line and where's the jack 10 of clubs it's like yeah wants to jam main i mean not mainly here but it test size tv and then we have like this normal small size to get the jams in where let's double check where is it call okay check we bet let's say what was it 29 that's about half and then we see our like king queen of clubs it's a zero percent theory race it's okay right ace of clubs actually a little worse because we block even more of his blocks probably let's rip it in here and there we need him to fold like where is it where are some flushes that need to fold like 10 7 of clubs 30 ev catch 5 6 of clubs okay he's still allowed to call all of those so mainly it's just about him we need to find his bluffs in the first place and we need the thin value bets. Like what is shown as a fold here? The pocket sevens, the Jack 10 straight here needs to fold every time without clubs. We need to have those King Jacks with a Jack of clubs, 10 of clubs in the first place. I don't think they are a hundred percent in the big bet flop over bet turn. While I think that something like the flush draws draws are in their more, it's just like we need to find some, yeah, Jack-7 bluffs. What? Jack-7? The double barrel Jack-7 parts? No, that guy. No, that guy. Yeah. It's wild. It's really, really wild. Okay, so I hope that shows. We're like, obviously we can look at that hand and stop here, see like 0 EV, 50%. I hand let's freaking go but no we didn't play versus pio here if you do that in your in your training against pio perfect it's fine because pio where is it boom make sure we have this part here that's the first 20 30 percent fall equity that's kind of your safety pillow i right? That like, even the worst case, you kind of fall kind of soft because you have those 20, 30% fall equity and you don't burn every single dollar that you put in there. Where if, because people are value heavy in the first place and this guy showed strength, three streets, right? That we are running into something like that. Yeah, I think the big mistake I made, I saw his size on the flop. on the flop i reacted in my brain oh it's big then because i had a clear hand to call i kind of forgot i called i probably looked at the lobby the turn comes oh shit i call and then river it wasn't really i think that's the biggest leak on this hand i wasn't really thinking about what kind of hands he falls in about the investment it was just more like i see see a club, I see a nice card, potentially bluff, and I want to play a strong poke and look like a gangster. Maybe he'll fold because I have read he folds some big hands. What would you do? You play the same hand again now. What would be your conclusion now? How would you play the hand? I would fold 10. Right. This is the big learning here, right? Taking into account the big flop bet, then bet then the turn actually it's a pile play to fold it if you somehow misclick the turn then you wouldn't raise the river where this is a big learning that knowing which hands you want to make fold right before i was talking in that queen six of hearts but about villain having 10 7 9 7 10 9 all those potential snap folds and you i'm i fold those out perfect maybe some queen 10 queen 9 as well and maybe something value perfect crushing and here it's really yeah if we talk about him folding a straight already is this our goal making people fall straight probably not too much and one more thing what i just figured out here because the king of clubs is so much more likely to be the good jam here it's again a reaction to villain's strategy right because here villain is jamming most of the nut flushes together with some blockers we are less experienced players don't know that two and a half three times pot jam they just bet their ace five of clubs normal or even small for inducing. And then you actually run into an even stronger range. This is why here in the small sizing that we looked at, all those nut flushes are 0% in there. That's kind of a big deal also. Yeah. I only focus on myself. I want to bluff because it's sexy or whatever, and had no thoughts of exactly what you just said. Does he have even fold? Does he have even bluff? Does he even bear straight like that? Because like if he folds, I ran some node locks, if he folds them straight and sets, it becomes a much better jam, but a lot of ifs for that to be the case. And it's more likely just stupid, just fold and forget. Yeah. I think with that, we answered Samu Vai's question, whether we would in this full fold on the turn yeah this is exactly what now we're considering things we would love to do okay let's have a look lots of hacks here right it's a reason we talked so much about that already best case 50 sizing doesn't include flushes so many ifs no flushes and he needs to fold this jack tens without a club bet he first bets like that worst case suicidal bluff as a folding rate does not exist after 75 and then 150 turn and then i would say and then fetching again the sizing i like actually this i might mean anything thousands hell no super volatile spot potential like best case slightly winning maybe worst case burning every single dollar i give it a zero out of ten for those reasons three streets big sizing on the flop over bad turn s plate we fold river or call we don't find any bluffs either if we are not folding turn we are snap folding river we're actually just blocking his only bluffs to be honest okay so three hands in so far i need to up the pace but this was one of the most interesting spots let's sizing read slightly off freaking siberino okay let's get to the next one yeah i only use the sizing and the read he can fold but he got me that size the next one is a tough one so i skip this one for now but take like to calm down take an easier one now which is this one so we open race jack nine of hearts on the button big blind three bats a rather small sizing yes like this is uh probably someone who's playing stake sebarino yeah yeah absolutely so 16 small sizing mandatory call no other option. Pretty damn good board for the button, actually. We are happy already facing some checks, folding out some king-jack of diamonds, some ace-queen of something. And he bets half pot, where this is maybe for some people we don't have anything, but with the backdoor potential and the board being actually ours, this is a pretty clear call. So yeah, happy you go for that. Because this is our board, we can represent the world. We have good cards for us going, and we still have so many nuts in our range that something like this is happening. And villain checks. We start stabbing small because we freaking have it here. And river is a queen against a check call. And we think about going for it. How do we like that, guys? How do we like that chat? Oh, we didn't even jam. Okay. That's fine also. This is a three quarter, no jam. How do we like it? Let's say just the bet in general. I don't want to discuss the sizing here too much i think we can have both sizings 11 10 10 10 10 8 10 10 10 okay okay so everyone is for bluffing here let's make it a little tougher let's make it a little tougher let's say you have the chance to buy hero spot here you can buy into this spot where you play with this hand in this situation for 99 dollars how much would you pay him so what do you think is the ev of that situation the ev of your bluff 30 okay my guess so tucker wrote it again you probably don't see it he says 30 so this is high ev two big blinds four four dollars from kai like cheap ass car dealer again jeremy okay the question so i'm talking about the ev of the hand All right? So if you bluff here and villain calls perfectly, your bluff should be zero EV. Then you should obviously pay hero zero dollars to get into this spot. But we are all convinced that this spot is printing money. The question is now how much money is it printing? If villain was folding 100% of his range, it's like $99.20 that you could pay or you should not pay more than 99.90 right because you want to win something oh and kai already owes a beer okay subana wants to pay 70 that's a lot that's almost folding out villains full range i hope i hope that explained the question a little better jeremy 25 dollars 20 20 50 so right just this is a little trick you can you can help yourself with just thinking about okay how great is that spot are we talking about a potential zero ev bluff where it doesn't matter whether we do it or not like fuck it we can skip variants is it potentially minus 50 dollars like minus 280 like potentially the last hand or is it like really printing money and we are happy like you know this feeling when you are happily bluffing because you know you just you're just printing money villain looks recreational based on sizing so on risk more than 30 okay as we're still bluffing what are you paying for a value hand here probably the same price no okay so um obviously we are bluffing uh we can go different sizings i think i mainly go all in with that hand but okay yeah small is fine also and yeah it's just like it's a very very very i didn't give it a high rating because it's just such a standard bluff it's not like something special actually it's one that we always need to do i don't know why it gets like i know why but actually that that doesn't make any sense so actually i i want to give that a i gave that a six out of ten because we just always do it but actually it's a 10 out of 10 we need to bluff spot that's so overfolding an unprotected capped range william which kind of eight acts does he have like not much he needs to find the king eight suited 10 eight suited three bats in the first place from the big blind yeah with his sizing we can read into him being kind of a recreational that though they don't have it they cannot like the risk is villain is a super fish just like calling aces kings every single time but then still we have like some spades that might be folding like some ace king ace queen of spades whatever like there is something and yeah we just need to go with it that's the reason i didn't jam just in case it's like i don't remember if i had to read but in case he doesn't fold over paths which is kind of choose a size which saves some money in case he's that type of player. A nice, very good point from Samuel Bayer here. His profile might even donk 8x some of the time. So I doubt he has many. Not donking, but he just has a straight on the turn and keeps going. Right? Recreational player, I have a straight, let's go. Recreational is just not 3-bet bluffing a lot from the big blind max. This is our assumption because they can call instead. And every hand that you have in your 3- three betting range that contains an eight is a bluff. So maybe to represent that, it's like because I like that thought with the smaller size, right? It's assumption-based, but it's cool, right? Where we say there are some snap calls existing and they are like we don't know whether there are any snap calls the eight acts where or we agree probably that there's not a lot of them because again first of all you need to have them in your three betting range lots of people don't have that and then you need to keep going and then you need to understand on the turn which the recreational player probably doesn't do too much that you should check on that board structure but there is the risk that there are maybe some catchers that think about calling and some others that are not thinking about a calling right where that the fish is someone that has like i call that like here the aces zone we're like we know recreationals that just do not fold aces where tucker chose to take a sizing that only needs like that amount of folds which will pretty much always be good instead of taking this sizing that yeah needs villain to fold aces to actually make money then right so this is something where we can think about it right bluffing versus recreationals is a powerful tool especially especially like with small sizes, often when you know how they react, because they are often reacting without thinking about the sizing and what it means, right? I'm good or not, let's call or not, whatever the sizing is. Okay, I like it. Very different risk reward scenario here. How many of our mate hands? Not too many, actually. Because, I mean, what are our mate our main heads like ace high i don't consider a mate hand here nine's intense i guess i could have are we bluffing nines though i don't know i wouldn't i wouldn't bluff but i say i would have them i think in this line just call a bet on the flop yeah yeah exactly so it's like actually it's just our ace highest that we all start stabbing pretty much on the turn and that's it because villain bet half pot on the flop we don't have like i don't know do we float deuces if yes i'm bluffing that off all day long but i wouldn't yeah tough okay let's get to the next one six three of hearts blind versus blind this time and we face a check on a board like one of those that we looked at lately more or less when it was about blind versus blind check raising so we know here villain should do lots of check raising or like big betting we can obviously still stab a lot uh here given that that straight advantage for us and actually that more than payo would suggest probably because people are under check raising so again think of our jack 10 off suits here and um yeah so that's what you do with your nice gut shot no backdoor okay whatsoever and the turn is a king and first of all i like the chose. Because here on that king, we cannot value bet an eight really anymore. So we represent kind of two pair plus, which goes along with this freaking overbet sizing. I think here it's kind of cool to not block the backdoor. Like having a diamond would be cool. But then hearts is second best to just unblock villains a six of spades type event king six of spades he might play like that and yeah we just have have all those those snap folds and now we get a pretty nice rubber card i mean even i think we have a straight here so yeah again, I think we all agree that there's one sizing that we think about, which is $240.19 and a car and the key to our house on top. But how much do we like this bluff? Again, we need a rating zero to 10. What's your rating here? Five, eight, eight, eight, but still doing it, of course. Nine, six, eight. So no one thinks it's horrible. Six, six, six. Yeah. Okay. So it's... Okay. 10 of Ciberino. I love it. Six high, man. Yeah, six high. Okay. 10 of C, I love it. Six high, man. Yeah, six high. Okay. Six high straight. Okay, cool. I mean, I agree again with you guys. So it shows already that like, there's no deuce. There's no one. It's like, can it be bad if like no one in the chat thinks it's bad? No, it cannot. So five is pretty horrible. Five is my line for like zero EV. So we can still do it. Yeah, we have a straight. So, and we have a freaking Zoom or NL 200, 100 chickens. Why does it say PokerStars 50 cents, $1 actually up here? That's wrong. Who, I don't know, you timed out. Let's say you timed out, okay? No, I didn't. I didn't. Can you recall your recall your thoughts of the moment yeah so I remember that up to the river I was happy with my line and one thought I had in my head which why I didn't bluff is how I generated enough falls on a turn in terms of ace highs and some weak pairs that is the range is quite strong and maybe he's going to be too sticky. So at that point, I couldn't decide in-game is that enough weak hands that are going to fold or he's just sitting on a good king or something like that. And then I just didn't do it. So yeah. But now let's have a look what you would be doing now. Derek now folds on the turn that can give up now. That's best case. Oh, best case for how you played your hand, not for the river bluff. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, the best case kind of for the river bluff is building a sticky on the turn. And we have a printing bluff on the river. And now, yes, can't say if I would go for a river bluff all the time. I give it like a solid 8 out of 10. And I mean, first of all, he doesn't have any snap calls, right? To have snap calls, he needs to slow play a set. He can have pocket kings. That's the only snap call. But even if he has like a riverage 5-7 of diamonds, you're repping stronger than that. And you have like 4-6 suited. four six suited you can have six nine suited plus you have no bluffs left like the seven hits all your bluffs and they are all clear check back so it's just like really a very very believable spot where and this is very important here villain has lots of snap falls still villain has all five x of diamonds villain has all ace x of diamonds villain has uh like other random eight x of diamonds obviously as well and obviously can sit on like a random king of spades where this is this is love catcher you would really ever think about calling king six is a good hand to call with it's a fine hand this will be one of the zero ev catchers that is slightly plus ev just because of the the six blocker better to bet 150 or 250 you have straights villain will never race against that so all in is our size yeah i think that the reason i like it now even more is about all in because in game i don't think i was thinking about all in and i just i was just if i bet like 30 big the king's not folding and my my thinking was that he has a lot of that yeah 75 is not what we are trying here like we were at like two pair plus or a draw on the turn on the river all the draws got there at least from mindset perspective i like i didn't block because i didn't understand what i was trying to do so i checked in the king queen hand i didn't think but i still ripped in so yes there's one upside i mean this is a very good like i like that right this is very good approach to like i don't know what i'm doing here to not potentially punt 120 big lines right um and this this is a good good line so let's let's have a look at that board right i think this line might be a thing like not sure about the frequencies of the six three of hearts but uh it will be a thing for sure so uh we first of all see that like big bet can be a thing on that board for the small blind um but it's mainly checking right the connectivity is just good for for in position in position can use all kinds of sizings you use i guess half pot which is the major size here six three having a backdoor is always slightly better than not having one but it's obviously a mix in there that we need boom half pot villain should have that check raising range where we're pretty sure that's not the case and yeah then he has those check calls that are like all that kind of yeah also a lot of king heights fault so that's a good thing even harder for him to yeah i mean therefore he has all like yeah he should check king queen is really check folding that's insane like only only the back doors are calling this is lots of folding insane so i call turn was the king of diamonds So let's obviously range checking again and this is where we start polarizing a little we can oh this is what i don't do too much in my sims the small bet again that we can do with our queen eight ace eight you see like this is what all the hands that are indifferent so actually i'm not using another small bet i'm really polarizing to those two sizings here and make that one sizing this is uh this is the 21 into 12 or even 30 into 12 i'm just putting those two together and bet 21 with them the the 150 or i mean slightly over 150 and yeah 63 of hearts boom pile play nailed it right let's take the freaking 21 here and the river now is the seven of freaking hearts villain calls his calling range pretty clear random eight x definitely all the diamond ones all the king x that got there and yeah should like some pocket fives here some pocket eights yeah like whatsoever not really call river seven yeah boom and now i'm interested in the frequency first of all we see 45 of our range wants to freaking rip it yeah we have like this just shows how good that card is we take king eight and freaking rip it we can take like the what is it normal sizing 46 into 54 so the size the percentage below the bet 46 is the percentage of the pot 85 oh yeah thanks 85 right here so this is this is the one we can use with like thinner value, like an 85 here, like a five deuce, like a thin two pair that can be beat, but still has value against king X. But the all in is the important move here. And six, three. Oh, it was mainly betting bigger on the turn, but I told you I combined those two ranges so we can actually look at that here and really it makes sense let's go full height and this is here what i mean with how much would you pay for getting into this spot right this is it has an ev of like 4.49 big lines when we look at flop spots we talk about zero zero point something and this is just something that is like a freaking printing bluff in pile in pile so let's have a look what happens if we go all in villain needs to call this here let's change for like range height he needs to call ace king half of the time he called some king queen he calls like king six this is what i meant with is king six a good catcher don't fall for that trap of the blocker right king queen is zero ev king six because of the blocker is one dollar uh one big blind we're talking about big blinds here one big blind ev so it a difference, but it's a small one. If villains are not bluffing enough, it's still a horrible catcher. Villain needs to call some 8x. Villain needs to call some jack 8, some 8-9, some random 5-6. And now you can all guess together what is happening here. I think villains are calling less than 15%, I would say here, in a spot like that where everything gets there so i think this is an absolute freaking print if you understand how sizings work and why you can freaking jam such a big part of your range here because you just have it so often yeah a nice pot of blood so we have again a nice risky ward scenario where like like it's sorry that is a little different to the others we have snap folds just because there is there was a flush draw on the on the turn which gives villa lots of pierre plus flush draw or ace high flush draws even which is after calling a bet and an over bet is already a good bunch of his range so we have snap folds oops this is very very important if the turn was rainbow the spot is not as great and the good thing is because we are representing a straight villain has besides the pocket kings that very likely play differently he has not a single snap call he does not have a six four he he does not have a 6-9 or whatever made it straight that's it right and then it's such a board where i would say those bluff catchers is like a different style of bluff catchers because they have no freaking reason whatsoever to call that ridiculous bet because you need to start so crazy on the flop that you get there with enough bluffs it's almost impossible for you to be over bluffing because of the action before that's just that is just what you get what what is your upside of having the best river card in the deck for you that like he has no reason whatsoever obviously we are risking a lot right we are risking this oops wrong we need like what do we need like we risk 250 or 225 percent pot it was i guess so we need like 70 percent fold equity right but i think it's very likely that we end up in like just looking at the hands that villain needs to call down that we end up in that area somewhere right so having that in mind again we have that pillow of snap folds that like even if villain calls every catcher we are not lighting all the money on fire and the very likely uh likeliness where that we can see if we look things up and realize which hands in theory villain would need to call or in other spots would need to fold, which we don't believe anyways. Cool. I like that hand. This is my favorite spot actually these days. Just like this, being all in, in those spots, blind versus blind in position. Nice red line boost actually winning 48 big blinds here as well. And, oh, what did he have? That's why I remember the hand. Just my god how how dare you i'm lucky i mean really nice red line boost here yeah he has that type of shit yes that hurts that hurts yeah okay so the next one so i just keep going with those that i think are the most interesting yeah okay so the next one so i just keep going with those that i think are the most interesting i mean it's a i think it's a do we still have pile or like gto wizard open here there bet this year small blind i mean small blind does not open race ace three but ace four is the same hand and that is like um yeah with the correct suits it is indeed a good call right he beats all bluffs and has not equity that's all we need uh that's off the river yeah okay so ace 10 offsuit cutter versus big blind going for the small bet here on that board. We could use a half pot bet or even bigger, like that kind of board where we have the offsuit connection with the straight, like jack-ten, queen-ten, queen-jack. We can do whatsoever. I like the small bet a lot because people clearly under check-raise, and then I can blast a little more on the turn. Turn here. Bet is fine again. Fold jack but like keeping in all the queen tens jack tens and so on by checking oh he donks okay he donks whatsoever i thought about the second barrel uh he donks we have a rather clear call he donks something that improves on the six or something that does not want to check fold the turn and this we dominate like jack 10 queen 10 makes sense to dunk somehow or yeah six is not a great dunking card and not at all for that sizing so um yeah river is a jack still think like we did see that we called a large bet on the on the turn river is a jack we have all queen tens we have all flushes and villain now blockbacks how do you like that spot zero to ten oh samurai zero to ten nine ten ten nine eight nine ten ten ten okay so max and And, why like you're the only two who don't love that bluff can you tell us what like what are you scared of like you you think like does he represent strength in a way or do you think like his weird line he's calling off just all day long whatever he has why do you did you go for the 204 i feel like villain would bet a lot of flush draws on the turn but then follow up with a small river bet like i always try to evaluate action they take here right so turn can mean like okay they have a nice hand that connects to the board they don't want to check fold that's why they bet themselves like jack 10 or flush draw same thing but which flush draw do they have here that just didn't that did connect with the flop but they don't have king five of spades they don't call that on the flop so never fold river strange line yeah but like it's really that i interpreted a lot of weakness it can be like a nine it can be a random seven it can be a river jack and yeah i i think it's just like weird and we can represent the world again right because we get here with all the flushes and then the ten of spades is just a very very very very nice nice card here to have so yeah you even sized up a little you didn't go for the 50 button you're more representing queen 10 or like a random flush i like that 75 i think yeah it's you're not representing a river jack that's the thing that's so i i like that sizing here uh risking 57 to win 47 um or 48 it's kind of a different risk reward we need like 55 fold equity but yeah i think that's an absolute fine fine thing let's double check what you wrote here folding all catchers and is capped when chooses that river size well constructed uncapped range right it's like we get i don't think it's this we get like again this is this year tells me zero ev and this year tells me printing yeah so this is one of the spots where again like the the upside is great and the the the downside is very low probably like him representing like so much weakness while we have an uncapped nice range so everyone who does not want to bluff here is pretty much saying you're exploiting by being value heavy because obviously we have our value bets here and we need our bluffs so this is this is the main thing why well it's it's tough to have like offsuit ace of spades for example i'm not calling ace king offsuit against the big turn bet so um yeah i'm not loving it because he's such a weirdo taking this line and he might just end up rivering a jack with jack seven and just not folding that's my my concern where where i probably agree with michaud and max or like michaud especially what he wrote here i don't think that like flushes that big on the turn and then size down when they hit their flush on the river to then have like a block bed re-raise plan or something like that i don't believe or i don't want to say i don't believe it i've never seen it in like the last million hands so um that's kind of the thing so yeah that's all easy fold thoughts on over bluffing yeah i mean if we take those offset combos all the time seven of ten means i like over bluffing okay so we have time for two more hands i have five hands left here let's take two interesting ones this year no this is a standard triple okay this is the last one the last hand is for sure yeah you want to choose one tucker the last one we have in the slide is for sure the last one we talk about. And we have like four or five more. Queen five. Queen five suited. Because I think it's just another big investment, which. Queen five? It's like, we skipped it because. Oh, the crazy one. Yeah, the one I skipped. Okay, let's go for this. The crazy one. Okay, this is a little crazy. Yeah, I mean, Sepp has to vote 10 out of 10. Okay. He always does, though. Just the one, the king, really. The one that is, yeah, he always does, really. Okay. So we call a min-raise. You can go 9 out of 10. We understand it, severely. We go for a min-raise and then we actually check-raise here against a small bet. Small bet, not too much of a thing here, button versus big line on that board. I love that check race. Straight connectivity over card against all kinds of full shit. Yeah. Small sizing check race that we can go with like any King-8, Ace-8 type of fans put in our check raising range, deny equity from Jack-10, Jack-9, and so on. So it makes a lot of sense. Nice continuation possibilities on the turn. And yeah, he calling unfortunately turn is a five so now we got him and our straight draws got there six four gets there ace four gets there four five has appeared the obvious gloves but obviously it's tough now what would we do with our king eight with our ace eight i think block betting is fine for our hand just target ace highs a little further or the the overcards with the backdoor flush draw getting value from three x juice x pocket fours four five five six suited or obviously check just going with our hand hand strength and yeah you went for the check and we see a bet that we cannot see, but this is $9.87. So a third pot bet. We have probably very clear call. We are not double check raising this one. And the river is a four. So now two questions. Let's first, how much do you like dunking, everyone? How much do you like dunking, chat? 0 to 10? 5, 7, 8, 0? Okay. See, I tried to put this one in bio here on the side. Okay, so chat decides against dunking, and hero decides against dunking as well. I joined against dunking. I just want to think about it. I don't think villain stabs too many ace highs on the turn. Obviously you can have some six acts, I don't know, stabbing small. And villain bets half pot now. Third pot on the turn, half pot now. How much do we like raising here? So I make this. This is where where it starts now the five and zero okay i like it zero nine okay okay really with nine awesome three one two okay interesting uh i want to where's the no here button race i give you some time i want to put that in pio here eight of clubs do some parts three of diamonds as we range check as expected we don't see too many small bets but it's fine small bet where's the queen five of hearts the cool check race we have a 50 check race with the small sizing. Perfect. So we're nailing it here. Call. Turn is the five of spades and we can either what happened here oh let's click we find race button call and now we have the five of spades so here we go yeah you don't you shouldn't see it i'm still waiting we have a decent straight advantage to be honest we have five six we have maybe some aces what are you raising for value is anyone raising an ace no especially that's half ball i think less reason to raise yeah well is it the question if we represent a six only i don't care about his ace x which six x is he calling a check raise on the flop so we have four six suited if he open raises it we have five six suited with a six suited with a backdoor my check turn we have pocket sixes okay so but we see like okay we don't like it too much just Severino with a 10 and Kaihuni with a 9 king 6 suited alright so hero somehow decided there's no sixes in Villain's range. So let's fucking go. So yeah, Taka, can you tell us your in-game thoughts and your thoughts now after reading the chat numbers, how much they like it? I think in-game thoughts were that he's being, again, that half-sizing, if you play against me, just bet half and i don't know that half pot sizing just looked weird and actually now think about it i would probably wouldn't do it again but in game i thought i could just go and greedy with ace because i check raise check whole small bet and i yeah i probably just hit on some kind of pair and because of that that reason, I gave him quite a lot of ace-ex, and then I didn't give him many sixes, six-ex combos, except sixes and what you mentioned, six-four, six-five, and even six-four might be bigger on the turn. So basically my logic was he has a lot of bluff catches, basically like 80%, 90%, and some six-ex, and I make such a big bet and he should fall back. That'd be my logic. But now if I evaluated now, I looked at hand in the solver. So I know, first of all, I think that turn check call is already almost like zero EV. Yeah. So I can fold the turn because there's nothing going for me. And then river. I remember what hands you need that can't do this shit. It's not this one. So you need to have at least an ace. It's a couple of things. First of all, yes, we can just check fold the turn because our hand has no option whatsoever to really improve. We were his well hands that we beat and they those are the hands he checks back for sure like a three or a deuce so yeah we had our value there once he bets we probably we just have a big problem and then on that river four what is interesting is first of all what is villain's betting range right so villain should be betting something like that well first of all he needs to take the small bet then he needs to call this is why all those lines are so small let's do it like this he needs to bluff something like a 10-7 suited all right i think this is kind of realistic where again we need like this is 30 in the middle and these are the sizings he should be using like 10 something like that like 90 like really polarizing there so the half We'll be right back. the middle and these are the sizings you should be using like ten dollars something like that like ninety dollars like really polarizing the earth so the half pot is not really a thing too much right this year eight percent of the time was like eight six like an ace four like the ace x should go mainly smaller but it's yeah it's it's something like what, what triggered you, right? The small sizing because the six X should actually just that big. I mean, you are just calling your ACE, right. And he misses a lot of value when he has a six year. So yeah, that's, that's kind of it. And we need those bluffs here. We need 10, nine offsuit that villain floats on the floor. And this is again, the trouble that I'm seeing here that we might lack some snap falls right this this is the big problem and we need them for those large sizing if we look at pio now actually how i understand pio here is that your bluff is absolutely fine right that like the hands that are bluffing it's like a 6x we choose the all-in sizing right because he is just way more ace x than he has a 6x but you see we bluff for example pocket eights the set of eights we bluff eight five and this is just the well making the bluff like plus one big blind instead of zero or minus one this is just because we are unblocking all the bluffs i just the set isn't doesn't play a role it just means we have two eights so villain is more likely to have a freaking we block ace eight first of all on six eight and we unblock villains bluffs which every bluff that villain can have have gives us additional fold equity and this is why eight five and pocket eights are the best but actually like doesn't make a difference right it's like just about the spot the blockers do not really matter too much we have those six five six four little six three potentially and we go with them so i don't hate it but again the big problem is is villain in that game tree getting to the river with the bluffs we need to have the full equity we are we're wishing for right it's mainly in those spots it's not a lot about does he fold the ace or not it's more about those 20 30 snap falls that we want to generate it's so nice to not even think about it you jam 20 30 percent of the time he just or like 20 percent of the time he just snap falls his freaking 10-9 offsuit that he played that way and this is what i see as as the as the little problem here and let's just see uh to the all-in reaction i think this is even 150 big blinds keep still he still needs to call some of the ace acts so if he's value betting all of his ace acts and then throwing most of them away we are actually starting to make money again with a slight problem that his pocket sixes and so on should never be in a half pot bet and you can guess it you had this hand and well gave up five seconds yeah that sucked we are maybe again one thing that makes me suspicious always is this change of sizings. People usually don't use those like three different hotkeys. They click on their standard sizing, where their standard sizing, okay, here stepping on the turn third pot is standard. And on that river, I think the half pot sizing is just not standard. standard like not the same like the jack ten of clubs before but it's very likely that it means something right i'm just saying he puts us on like a four or five type pen on maybe another turn five on ace eight king eight i think people just click unexperienced players just click on that 75 percent hotkey or 70 or 66 whatever they have and that is their standard sizing while whenever they are interested in something and they start thinking it's like they do something special like the the sizing i want to raise the least amount against would be like a third pot sizing here to be honest because i think it's never ever a bluff but yeah let's get to the last spot now we are already uh over the time a little but the last spot because what's your rating for this one quickly oh sure the rating rating rating rating here it's not a zero it's not a zero i i like the thought process but i don't like this risk reward against an uncapped range where potentially bluffs are missing okay it's like the spot is okay if we were just 60 big blinds deep and this is our risk reward i would actually start liking this spot oh yeah yeah it's just the we are risking 120 110 to win 36 it needs us to have so much fold equity while i think there are snap calls in his range yeah and this is we cannot discount something like six this year as we can with piyo just because he doesn't understand the river sizings that's the main problem okay we defend very easy one we are on the turn we are back on 6-6-3. He should check back quite a lot against the big blind here. Turn is a freaking jack. Villain bets small. And we think about check raising here. How much do we like it? Zero. Boom. Wow. Yeah. Is it that like all the spots that the chat hates those are the spots that go wrong and the spots that the chat likes are the ones that work out it's great next time i play i'll just put in the chat just have the chat railing you not really i mean you are messing things up siberino okay we hate it we hate it let's say do we like the spot for bluffing Thank you. not really I mean you are messing things up Severino okay we hate it we hate it let's say do we like the spot for bluffing and I'm just saying okay we hate the 10-9 of hearts do we like the spot for bluffing though you can rate it again spot for bluffing a seven yes yes I like this was it's the follow follow up question Mario wait for it I need some more yeses or noes here or like a rating for the how much do we like this spot okay probably okay so we can still wrap all sixes we can check range again on the jack if we don't put out like the 240% sizing. So we all like the spot. And I agree with that. I like the spot as well. But the 10-9 of hearts is just like one of the worst hands we can have. So, okay. It's actually blocking his potential bet folds, like a king-9 that he starts stabbing now. So I prefer to have like a 7-8 is better. I'm just unblockinging his bed folds a little more while obviously having any overcard to the jack is even better or having something cool like a gut shot is even better okay then follow-up question what is our main sizing when check raising here yeah i was waiting for this yes i wanted to say like there's there's only one answer and siberina question for siberina it's a a question so yeah because we are saying hey we have a new freak you have your you turned your king jack or you have your slow plate aces but by the way we have six and this is what we want to tell him so this year just is bad sizing and the worst hat because like what are we representing a six that doesn't want to take value? Or a jack that somehow beats villain's ace jack slightly? Like, I don't know. Yeah. So just like, doesn't fit. The story doesn't fit. And then on that queen would be great if we had an overcard, right? On the turn, because now we have a value bet with the random queen. And then at least you found out and just gave up and okay this is exactly the hands that this is a i mean not necessarily great step right just like the weakest jack he has let's just double check that board as well is it i think i checked that that size doesn't exist for him either and i think the problem is i kind of recognize these spots where sizing don't exist. Yeah. I don't make the correct adjustments. This hand for rapid six, rapid bloody six properly. And in the other ones, you know, the half pot sizing, they don't exist, but people just probably two value head and don't have no blocks. So I have good intuition. I just make the wrong decision. Yeah. Just see, we want to see six six of spades six of clubs three of diamonds three of diamonds let's have a quick look together check so we could donk something sure villain needs to check back like about 50 that's cool we get the jack of clubs on the turn we could say right away we have a six with our two and a half like you're 250 percent sizing or we can block and say like we have a small pier and like where jack and you sit on ace high these are our two options but it's we can simplify and like check our range as well it doesn't change too much this 250 percent is just saying yeah we are going like directional all in in a way and check villain is representing the strong jack x and he should start betting that right we see a jack eight is just a bullshit play that is scared of playing river somehow uh and then he steps small uh we're like yeah it's like stabbing small means he has thin value which doesn't make sense to go for it if we have still a high check-res frequency because we can't play all the 6x like that. Stabbing small into some range that has the nut advantage here is not a good idea. So you'd rather check back 70% again. Not check-check. No, he went for that small size. Small size. And then we just tell him, like, oh, the 2E doesn't exist? I think it's 150 big sims for me, but that's why. Yeah, but it only offers the 100. I'm 100% sure that this sizing, this is a GTO wizard problem here, that it's not offering a bigger sizing. It would for sure go for the bigger size. It will make up for it by the river, I guess, and go bigger there. But yeah, this is all the 6X we're having. And then obviously our 9-10 of hearts is not a great selection, but 9-10 of clubs would be cool. Or having like a random overcard, like an ace high. We can just check raise a random ace high. We can check raise a random king. This is clubs, not random not random the ace highs seem to be a little cooler king queen two over cards seem seem to be a cool check raise and um yeah this this has to be a bigger size than that and then villain calls should be he should be indifferent on the sorry uh here on he should be indifferent with ace jack on the turn already right he sits here on jack eight jack nine he should be indifferent and then on the river let's say this is a brick i want to put a brick out there i'll take the three as a brick not a queen where he can make some sets that check back the flop like pocket queens and then you have the big blinds decision where we are now making up for the wrong turn sizing with three times pot this pretty much Thank you. you have the big blinds decision where we are now making up for the wrong turn sizing with three times pot this pretty much gto wizard is just telling itself how it fucked up on the turn because of missing sizings which is something that that sometimes happens here right it's just like not all in for 150 picks because villain might have some slow plays like pocket jacks we will see that 50 of the time so we cannot go super super super crazy but we should have went a little bigger on the turn and from there right so i like the spot i like overdoing it even but having an overcard to go is even better all right yeah thanks so much for the for the for the for the hands and for chilling out here uh tucker i hope you took something away here yes and i hope everyone else has this image and if you just don't know next time you can just think about what would the chat say yeah and i will yeah maybe i'm just looking at no i don't have anything like uh i just think about did i have a crazy bluff myself i can show yes today but no i just ran the second nuts into nuts all day i think bananas versus block bet my takeaway for today yeah when they have snap falls that's a good take because risky word is just great all right great um yeah talk to you uh share as always share the hands in the in the in the cash part of discord happy to to have a look there to make some, some more Yeah, talk to you. As always, share the hands in the cash part of Discord. Happy to have a look there, to make some more looms and so on. And yeah, let's up the aggression from now on. And I can't wait to jump into my next session. I might start a session in a second, just checking in with my wife and boy to see what's up. And then we'll go a little crazy. Thank you very much.
