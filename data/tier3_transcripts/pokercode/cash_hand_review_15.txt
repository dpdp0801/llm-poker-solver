### TOPIC: cash hand review 15
 I cheat a little for today's coaching because I didn't prepare anything but I was talking to a good friend of mine and he made sure to deliver. So we got plenty of hands to go through. We got NL 40k plus action of one of the biggest winners of the last five years I can say on the on, on the poker sites that everyone can play. So, all right. Cool. So any NL 40 K plus review I got his, I think is the GG database of like a couple of months. This year, my plan for today is just to give you an insight into just one session, but we have the stuff and he told me it's okay to just keep a look at it it's yeah it's a little fun so let's just see why not let's scroll a little around that and then I want to show you guys so this is don't forget the graphs this is filtered for VP IP is true so maybe this year so yeah we have a nice little graph with a winning red line. It's actually just 13 000 hands which is interesting to see because this is what it's all about on the high stakes to find good games and get some hands in and then you have that massive variance. So actually we are talking here about in just 8 000 hands a little 800k upswing followed by a little 600k downswing. And I'm pretty sure he did not really play worse in the second half than in the first half. So just that you have an orientation of where the hands are coming from that we will take a deeper look at today. I didn't select a lot. I chose kind of one session, I'm happy to just show for the fun of it the biggest hands, but yeah I'm ready to answer any questions and my focus today is on how can we learn from some of the best players because usually we see the biggest pots, we see like some highlights if we if we are looking for that let's say like a high stakes threat and two plus two we find some big hands but this is usually not where the big magic is happening where i can already tell you there is not much not much magic happening just figuring out how they are playing all the small spots where we are getting lost every now and then and yeah about big time about not messing up i think this is the big takeaway i can i can start with that actually and go back to my little presentation so this is the plan for today i'm right now in the middle of giving a little intro of where that stuff is coming from what i try to do with you guys today as i said i will repeat that over and over again i'm ready to answer any question in the chat well anything is fine obviously i like more of the questions about the hands that we'll be talking about we will browse through lots of hands and then maybe come up with key takeaways i can the big one i have nothing written down yet the big one so far is just don't mess up and and just follow follow odds and outs and and equity and ranges and you do okay even on the highest stakes and yeah i think we will see less surprises than you would expect every time i browse his hands i don't know where the red line winnings are coming from and it's quite interesting all right consistent fighting spirit in the small pots where a lot of players aren't super interested in maybe but this is where i i see like surprises so what i like to do myself now and what i like you to do at least in your brain is just thinking about like that that thinking that way browsing through hands like what would i do just to, where is something different? If your answer is, I don't know, it's absolutely fine, right? It's just if you say like, I'm betting big here, I'm betting small here, I do this, I plan to do this and that on the turn and on the river, and then we see something totally different, this is where we can learn something. So we are actually trying to spot differences in our game, how we would play those hands compared to one of the confirmed best cash game players there are right now. So yeah, let's do that. Let's jump into the action. And yeah, for the fun of it, I'll let you guys choose. Do you want to start with the biggest hands or with going through a session of the let's say Probably more interesting like the one part is fun. The other part is is learning So type in a one for big hands and the two for learning Learning learning learning. Okay, that's yeah, that's easy. Okay, we keep the fun for the end and i chose this session because it's just a nice amount of hands and we go by time so what i like or is important to me here is that we really go through a session as it is. So I filtered for VP IP is true plus flop scene. I can tell you he's playing preflop charts against reasonable players. Most of the time when there's NL 40k running or higher, it means that there is a big recreational on the table. So we will see or or might see big deviations whenever we see that you can be sure that we are playing against the recreational player so there is we won't see any cool three cold four bets this will be like you can just browse GTO wizard this will be very very very much the same maybe like some small sizing changes but it doesn't make sense to look at that this is why i filtered for vpip true and saw flop is true so yeah let's go for the replay do you play at the moment online on which side from lovehouse klaus you probably just dropped in here i got a second time in debt like five weeks ago now and i have no time at all so actually the last five weeks I think I didn't play a single hand before I jumped like maybe in September I played a little 1k on GG it was always tough to find the time to really look for good tables which I would do for a 5k or 10k and I did some videos on like the highest zoom games that are running on PokerStars which since I'm looking at it when my older son is in in kindergarten which is 9 a.m till about 3 p.m which means it's always the morning and there's nothing running so actually i did mainly the videos on zoom 100 all right let's jump into the action i obviously don't show that in big blinds because it's just more impressive and more fun like that we play with a 40k stack it's 200 400 100 no anti people are playing super deep so far we don't know who the recreational is and we just play vpip hands so how did you make money at the moment i i take the money that i that i made I made before to support my family during the tough times right now. But I plan to play again at some point, so don't worry about me, I'm doing okay. Alright, so we see a little more than a min-raise from under the gun. I'll just describe the hands until we get to the spot where we have a decision. And we defend. I guess it's kind of standard. It's already kind of close if you look it up depending on the rake structure but since we play very very high stakes the rake even on GG poker is in big blind per hundred not the highest so we need to defend hands like that. We shouldn discuss about that I hope and we see a flop so and face a continuation bet a quarter pot continuation bet let's just stick to that pattern of how are the buttons on the stars one is fold two is call and three is raise what is your first instinct answer here we got the for fold, two for the call and three for the raise. I want to put it in the chat just to be sure but you guys are good. So this is beautiful. This is such a beautiful hand. Difficult depends on position of villain versus button. It's call, raise. We have a spot now. They are unknowns for us. They weren't unknowns for Doody I guess and he knew who the recreational is. So it's tough. We see a lot of 3s, 2s and 1s, all of it. So this means it's a beautiful hand and actually I have no clue would be my answer. I absolutely feel you. I think everything is fine as Kdolbitte is even saying. Important here, we have a backdoor flush draw, backdoor straight draw, plus especially important the over overcard to the to the jack having the queen of hearts way better than having the ten of hearts obviously so yeah i think understanding that all options are fine and maybe even relying on some reads and what this guy is over c betting over folding is beautiful and duty goes actually for the race spicy three winning poker mindset i think we like that we want to play some red line this guy calls and the turn is a queen i think here we have a rather clear spot and again i'm asking you for the one two or three the one in that case is obviously a check the two is a well only a one or two check check is the one and two is the the bet Alright, so we got we got some some at least the mid stakes pros in here some some people who learn poker pretty nice I think it's a very clear one We need to evaluate the turn card the turn card being a Broadway card is beautiful for under the gun Just connects with all his let's say obviously he makes new sets his whatever ace king with the backdoor gets stronger he has the queen jacks and so on so it's just a good card for him which means we will bet lower frequency on average but we will keep a big sizing and into the big sizing using that we want to polarize we want to have stronger value hands we just a random queen is not strong enough our sets we will be betting big directional in pretty certainly and that means this just doesn't make the cut and therefore it stays a check and yeah villain starts betting small just fine whatever any sizing will be fine we have a clear call i I don't need need to ask you for that the deuce of hearts on the river an interesting card we can have quite some flush draws that makes sense to check call some some flush draws as well on the turn especially having the queen of hearts and villain does this year so first what we learn seeing actually it's the first send i go by time not by big pot it's the first hand of the session that we vpip and we get into a spot like that facing that three times river jam again i'll ask for the one is the fold and the two is the call we block flushes we We block sets. We have a freaking queen. 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1. Michael Key is freaking... we have a freaking queen 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 michael keys freaking calling station rare rabbit calling station kepala's calling station so yeah if we put that into the solver just because of the queen of hearts i think it will be more or less indifferent uh indifferent having a queen is obviously beautiful i think the queen of hearts doesn't matter. I think he needs to have like a king high flush plus to get the maximum from a queen high flush for that overbet jam. The queen is good for the boat blocker. But yeah, we are facing a 3.5 times pot jam after showing lots of interest in the pot. First instinct is going with the size and being a fold and i would be i mean i i can tell you i i know how the first hand ends here but i i i'm pretty sure i was pretty sure by by the time i've seen it for the first time that duty is never ever calling here right obviously you can make some red line with bad calls as well or like not losing red line but in all the games i know this is a this is a bad call but yeah it's in theory not too bad so here we go so we have interesting start especially with that flop action but i'm happy that just like the whole pool of viewers just decided that it's really a close spot and you were absolutely right. We need window down a bit to avoid spoilers. Oh you see it there already? No. Where do you get spoiler... spoilered? Oh the loss here okay yeah I see I see I see. Okay how can I kill that? There should be a way to kill it. Show hands graph. Here we go. Thanks. Let's go. All right. Next one. Big blind versus cutoff. 2.2x raise. Queen 3 suited. It's again on the close side. Definitely we're going to defend that on those stakes. Not because it's high stakes. Just because the rake relatively is small. so we need to defend a bit wider and we faced that bad again we have a backdoor straight draw and a backdoor flush draw don pichel already goes with a with the one i don't know whether that is for this hand but again i keep asking you guys put in a one two or three for the fold is the one call is the two and the race is the three three three race race race race race we get all the races three options are fine one two three actually I somehow I'm not sure whether I'm still subscribed to do wizard Wizard. Let me see on the side. I think it's a rather clear-ish fold. Just the hand is way worse compared to the last time. Obviously, it's not a one card backdoor flush draw, but a two card. So if we hit spades, it's really good. The straight is not really cool. We need a six and a four, plus we don't have an overcard. So that overcard, which means three direct against the top here As it has been from the jack seven deuce should be quite a big deal. Let me just see Cutoff raises it's different sizes here and queen three suited is probably not a part of the it's a call. Okay, and Let's see how close it is It's not not sure how my instincts are after not playing for a while. But just trying to explain the reasons why that hand is quite clearly worse than the last one. I have it on the second screen I'll show you once we get there. Alright, so Q3 suited here is facing a third pot bet that GTO Wizard suggests. but you see it's It's a fold. It's not a call. It's a fold. Alright Q6 gets already better Q5 is a peer or did I yeah, Q5 is a peer. Q6 way better backdoor straight and A3 would be interesting right the over card for Initial chance to hit something on the turn Obviously the wheel draw on top, but the overcard plus the nut flush So it's just like way more upsides on different run outs that would be good enough But here keep an eye on the overcard. It's not just the backdoor flush draw. This is quite important, right? Something like this happens. We check raise big Especially with that ace you can see how many ace x you're folding out if i just see like the direct upside of then hitting an ace so that's pretty cool okay cool let's keep going duty finds the fold so i love that start right i hope it's interesting for you i know it's just two hands not much happened, but we've seen the queen 10 that we said is like everything indifferent and we all agreed and we found the reasons and pro high stakes player goes for it. Here we get the arguments because it kind of seems similar to the first hand, but it's actually not. It's just way worse. And we get the the clear fold which is kind of confirming what i said here or tried to explain regarding that all right all right so okay let's keep going next one 7-8 offsuit 2.5x open raise from the button so far so standard small blind call always interesting and we get a Queen Jack three now let's do the one for the check the two for the small bet and the three for the big bet one two three three is the big bet one is the check and the two is the small bet so we get a couple of check backs and Queen Jack three and a couple of small bets. One big bet, so we are check small, check small, our hand is trash. All right, so the hand doesn't get trashier than that. Already if we take 6-7 instead we have a nut backdoor straight, so 7-8 is kind of the worst hand possible with no backdoor and this here shows a lot about duty's style which is lots of range bets whenever possible i can tell you that he's never betting big here he there's lots of reasons for a big bet but he plays small only and just allows himself to keep his entire range together and split on the turn then into into multiple sizes. That's kind of his game plan, if you want to say so, which definitely works against the big blind. I think it's a stretch to do it against the small blind, so it would be interesting who the small blind is and how much we know about his range. There can definitely be queen-jack off in there, king-10 offsuit, ace-10, so lots of connectivity. Maybe the small pockets as well, so he has pocket 3's full frequency, very likely in quite a tight range. And then if you bet the weakest hand you have, then you're just betting too much. So I can't say it's a mistake, but I can say he's likely overdoing it here. Either on purpose or not depends on the villain, but this is just how I want to explain how much you can read out of one hand into his strategy. Range bet versus small blind, I think, is very close, but it's clearly not the case. It will be close or kind of easily possible against the big blind but yeah small blind always depends on the exact range. Does he think people play worse against small bats in general to go for range betting as much as possible? Not necessarily but he knows that he plays this game tree turn and river almost perfectly instead of playing a check check game three that on boards where he does have the advantage where well you need to really really play good checking ranges if you play those 70 30 or 80 20 splits with like a 20 checking range and then really have good hands there as well call down correctly delay bet correctly you can say it's tougher for both players and you are the one with the advantage so you can make use of that that's what i said in lots of coachings where i actually like the delayed game plan but it's not duty style this style is maximum simplification and then getting to late spot in like just preparing to play turns perfectly. I think this this summarizes it pretty much. He's fine to do a small flop mistake to then gain the advantage of playing turns and rivers perfectly. So it's not too much about how Willem is playing that flop, but preparing a spot that is coming up. Is Willem unknown? Not at the time, but for in the replayers so I don't know so far who is the recreational. There is a big recreational on the table for sure we don't know who it is. Maybe it's the small blind. All right so he starts to play on the turn on those advantage boards exactly. So he gets check-raised obviously we are not doing anything stupid keep it simple. Alright so the worst 10 gets folded. Alright let's keep going. Ace-10 offsuit, cutoff flat. We have nothing there's a 7 on the board and a 5 on the board. This triggers for all the members who watch my videos this is a range check spot here the cutoff hits two sets he has very likely in his range that's enough for for having a range check here I think this is what he does another check and now we see a nine so I'm not questioning everything where I think there is one clear best option like here for the check on the flop I'm not asking but now things get interesting. So we might have King 10. We might have King Queen We obviously still have pocket fives pocket sevens pocket Jacks Queens Kings aces if we are talking about range check Villain can have sixes can have aids you can have a screen you can have I don't know a state suited Now the nine we kind of connect with that a check call really sucks what are you doing one for the check two for the small bet three for the big bet and let's go for a four for a crazy over bet so we got three checks four checks one crazy over bet ifbet. If he simplifies so he check raised this spot. Well now we are on the turn and something happened already, right? He has his entire range still. I'm pretty sure he range checks the flop. So I think the crazy overbet I gave it as an option just to see is not an option. Villain has a tight range and the 9 smashes his range kind of. So just running into his set of nines like crazy is not really cool, I think. So yeah, I kind of ruled that one out. I like the one. I like the two. I like the three, depending on Villain. And he went for an interesting quarter pot. I think this is not really a thing with with that hand if we go down to it on a hand level we can say okay he keeps something like ace eight a six in there he keeps King Queen King ten Queen ten in there stuff he kind of dominates does that make sense doesn't get to showdown versus those hands I don't. For me, this is already a sign that this guy might likely be the weaker player. Just a first sign, feeling. I don't know because that quarter pot out of position on that 9. I think it's more a cut-off card which explains that we should bet on the smaller side if we are betting. But yeah. He calls. River river is a six so this guy might still have pocket sixes something like seven eight suited pocket eights nine eight suited and the six I think is a very bad card for us we have all the broadways if this guy is a weaker player maybe he doesn't bluff with King Queen so I think we have a rather clear check having some not shoulder value against someone who bluffs correctly but we have shoulder value against someone who might mess up um or it's just not qualifying for a bluff uh boris flugy all right so we see that check and we obviously don't try to catch this one okay so again interesting turn bet that's actually the first thing that is really interesting in my eyes that he does the 7-8 offsuit c-bet most of the guys wouldn't do it but i i can tell you how his kind of game and play style works so it's interesting to see i can't tell you whether that style is better than another style because it's it's like an on-purpose not optimal flop play very likely and then making up for that on turn and river I no one knows whether that works out results speak clearly for him So yeah, that's good. And I think this is a rather straightforward river give up and important to not say like oh Those guys are always going crazy. maybe this is exactly the spot where we need to give up instead of going crazy we could check raise the river i don't think so lots of eight acts in that range cutoff versus under the gun flat standard not really i think duty is playing without flats the higher the stakes go the there is rake, the more it is like the cheaper it gets to call, but the flat already is a hint that this guy might be the recreational also. What am I bluffing here? This is a good question. This is a very very good question but I can't bluff much because I'm not value betting much. I think it won't be a range check but after betting small I just don't have much 8x so the only thing is a small bet and I can't bluff something that has shown a like like I prefer to bluff my king 10 honestly even though blockers are not perfect to fold out ace 10 just yeah if he's bad or misses a bluff I'm still sometimes winning with ace 10 and that's enough of an argument against the bluff. Ace-deuce to ace-4, we shouldn't bluff on a bad card on the turn. Obviously those came up to mind for me as well, but we are just not betting those on the turn. But it's really really tough. That cutoff flatting range depends on how defined it is, right if I think about a cutoff flatting range in the zoom games, it's like fives through to to tens And nothing else some suited broadways if this is the recreational we can talk about king 10 offsuit here Who knows right? So it's it's more of a guessing game for that Okay Ace queen under the gun open cut off three bet so far so standard we get the call we flop ace high ace king nine we see a quarter pot c bet pretty standard we can work with something like 10 bets on that board as well but it's more it doesn't really matter a small bet just i want you to understand and with different videos for for the in the member section where i try to explain more what we are exactly aiming at how something like 10 can make a lot of sense here but if you play your ranges fine in the end it doesn't matter and i'm pretty sure that duty just freaking range bets like what is that 27 i don don't know 25% I don't want to do the math those odd numbers because of that rake structure okay now I after I say I need to do it 26% all right not 27 but 26 exactly okay so really doesn't matter we can go bigger now to charge his King X his ace Jack his ace 10 his flush draws range wise to hurt his pocket eight seven sixes i like the small bet more rainbow boards because they are they cannot navigate with their their pocket peers here against the smaller bet he's just calling with club folds without and we lose some value from like the flush draws backdoor flush draw it's easier for him for him to counter those very small bets on a flush draw board. But that's my more personal taste, how you want to build up the game. I can tell you Doody simplifies again, has one sizing for all his hands here. All right, so hand is over. That's it, right? So far, I think we are like seven, eight hands into into the session we together spend like 25 minutes on it and seven eight hands or seven eight vpi piece in a session let's say this is maybe 15 to 20 minutes on the table maybe a little more but yeah that's just one session this is how it is and play all of them as good as possible to wait for the next spot. Let's see this one. We get a 3x open raise from someone who sits there already with 350 big lines. King, queen, I think not many options but calling. Small bet. King, queen, high. Clear call. Check. Clear showdown value. Check back. King, no kicker, right? It's... yeah. I think there's no value in that and yeah I think this hand plays itself. I would be too greedy to go for a crazy... it's so easy for him to sit on that ace and go for the bluff catches so there's not much reason to to try and value bet a king villainous check calling is king four this is not something we get value from if the kicker plays king queen is a value bet like this year it's just a clear check yeah easy hand i would say all right pock tens three bets small one versus button cold four so interesting always the sizings here I'm going to go a little with aces traps and stuff like that and the bigger it is the more i go for the dead money and jam a little more so we see the fold here everything is kind of fine right this range is is like tens or nines plus i would say and then like the suited broadways ace queen offsuit plus something like that if we decide to play i like as you say square or as a squad at czech republic says the 23 big blinds for me i would go for 100 call to be honest with tensames don't see the reason for anything else against the biggest knits in the world i would be folding but we won't find those here um yeah we can make some huge hero faults on lower stakes against the biggest knits actually then it's an easy fold yeah we we don't beat any like if people have nines okay we beat that but we don't beat a pocket pair and all his Bluffs have two over cards so if he doesn't have enough of those bluffs on lower stakes, we can just fold whether we have fives or tens it's kind of the same hand and Not just the C, Z, Z, Z gave me the vibes. But yeah, Poland is fine. All right So yeah, I expect the call and we see a jam there must be in-game reasons certain player i don't know doesn't make sense from theory i think it can never be horrible it can never be great it's one of those spots the question is is he doing that often enough with his ace queen offsuit maybe sometimes has ace jack offsuit something like that hands that perform well against pocket 10s but have a clear snap fold so it's about our fold equity and yeah this is a clear I mean not a huge but a rather clear deviation yeah and bink another board aces as always okay actually not too interesting because it's yeah it's a big pot it's hundred big blinds going in the middle but it's not interesting from from learning standpoint we all can read preflop ranges we can easily understand why or what needs to be the case that one move is better than the other but yeah we don't know anything about the player so Doody made a decision here that we don't know whether it was good we will never find out. Okay ace-five of clubs then. Interesting three-way spot we got a button flat off the guy it's still the same table it's all on the same table it's a one tabling session i can tell you or it feels like always the same names or maybe it's two tables and every second hand this table who knows so button is likely the recreational queen jack seven what's your play one for the check two for the small bet three for the big bet so someone already planning on the button bet for the check race. Got the check check check Alright so Doldbitte here with a reasoning that something like a deuce instead of a seven adding a backdoor straight adding Maybe less sets for the button Makes it better for us to c-bet Two against recreation one versus rec check call is uh okay so yeah i think anything is fine the three is out of here multi-way if we want to bet it's a small bet i agree with geduld but if the seven was a deuce three or four instead this would be great it is not so check is definitely not a mistake a lot on that recreational. If this is a recreational that you want to have value hand against, I prefer the check right away instead of building a pot out of position where lots of turns you're kind of... you need to fire again if it's a king, if it's a ten, if it's clubs, and then you build a pot where you don't want to. But yeah. So we see the check, it seems like we have a good spot to dodge some action here we can put instant pressure on deuces threes fours five sixes and eights absolutely that's absolutely correct but we could snap fold them out on any later streets also so we need to find the what is better instead of it doesn't that work obviously we have full equity with the bet and we have backdoor equity that's fine all right so so dr sigi apparently is is a not sigi capella who just finished eighth place ept prague a friend of mine i i I was I was rooting for him I didn't go too well on the final table if you have seen that crazy bluff of the the guy who ended up second but yeah yeah super nice guy so apparently not Dr. Sigi all right cool yeah easy again what is interesting which will lead to the key takeaways in the end, it's like Not messing up, right? Obviously we could randomly build a pot here and I'm not saying it would be wrong, but so far He is I think less aggressive than the the average player in the chat wants to be. It feels like It went amazing with Jaxxy. I didn't watch that. I just read the in the summary i i actually tuned in and then i've seen that that flush versus deuce three off bluff i think his turn check race with the flush was a kind of huge mistake to then put himself into an ugly ugly spot with a yeah something that just doesn't belong there but yeah don't want to bore all the others with with the hands they haven't seen from ept prog all right so 6-5 offsuit very close here now this is definitely the confirmation that this needs to be the recreational player this is a 2.3x 5-6 offsuit shouldn't make it so there needs to be a reason and the only reason is this guy is a little weaker. We can all play this versus a Seabed which is a fault. Again nothing crazy. Yeah the fault will be good against 99% of the players. You need to be a little more life captain to read something into the snap jam of like a random dude but he doesn't have that experience and it's really tough to pull that off then in that moment even though you would have it. Okay same spot like 5-6 off suit ace it off you can't argue with rake structure or anything this is a deviation this needs to be the weak player that you want to play against right this is interesting maybe the second part for the key takeaways it's way less about the the spots that no one cares about or are close zero ev in the chart you need to get to play with a player where the money is coming from especially on low stakes because all the other players are insane sharks so take your freaking go two three pips too wide this is the guy who apparently will mess up and you want to fight with him. Ace-8 check check here we go let's see what happens I think only check is an option really and interesting interesting so we block the ace highs often the one the look-alike for again all the members i teach a lot with the look-alike principle when we have an ace in our hand we will check all ace highs here it's a good good good reason to also check this hand here. Just making that read that this guy is the recreational I think it's a massive mistake to check this one. I'm very very very sure This is the head I haven't seen I'm very sure that duty bets. So the question is now How much would you be betting this guy? It's a recreation take this as confirmed now Those those two calls are a hundred percent sure. So what's your size? Put him on a hand. This guy sits on... Yeah, put him... I want to know two things. I want to know his hand, Willen's hand, and your bet size. I want to hear something like he has king-queen off and I bet $3. So Skrads makes a theoretical standpoint if we think about bluffing as well. But here against the recreational, everything is allowed. So he says, so betting big is better because we target ace-highs. Targeting always means we try to make them indifference. Maybe it's a recreational where we can just bet exactly the amount you will be calling with ace highs when we have an eight and bet exactly the amount you will be folding to if we don't beat ace highs so this would be the the best play then if that exists right so right now we put him on a hand so here these nice knights says ace king max value pot bet probably if you put him on king 10 maybe you just bet 400 who knows you put him on queen high bet 400 here Mack the knife says so he has pocket fives I bet two-thirds pot ace higher so we see lots of opinions on like different hands that are possible I think ace high is just the most most most likely just combo wise some some pocket fives pocket sixes yes they could bet turn they could bet flop so i'm a lot in team ace high here maybe king queen but something like queen jack is more likely to just bet and now the question is what's the bet size that they are calling and i'm like also in let's say 66 to 75 to 80 percent camp like pot seems a little ambitious who knows so yeah maybe three times pot is the correct answer we don't know but it's interesting to think about that and see where the edge is coming from so yeah we block ace high ourselves but if we know he only plays ace hikes high likes like that there are still three ace x out there right so it's always so 3000 yeah if we if you i don't know the hand that's that's even more fun now i clicked through the first ones but now it's even more fun maybe it's the perfect size maybe he makes ace king fold let's see but versus fish they don't care whether it's two bb or five we've a small pot. Yeah, I think it's a lot about dynamics. If it's one tabling super high stakes, it's a lot about is this guy pissed right now? Is he not pissed? Does he want to own someone or not? This gives room for those overbets. If this guy is pissed, maybe three times pot is the best. If there's nothing happening so far, he might just folded because he has not nothing in his eyes and he gets the fold all right so yeah winning poker mindset a good good thing here recreation is massively overfold versus over bets coming here with kind of a population tendency which i think is tough the recreationals that are ready to play nl 40k with sitting there with 100k dollars are probably not the recreationals that we that are part of that population tendency so the regular guy who plays on NL 50 NL 100 and just puts in some dollars to gamble that off they are massively overfolding this guy is more someone who looks for a challenge that's more the type of guys you have there and they are usually a little more call happy all right so scratch very good question this is a clear value the question is do we balance this with bluff or we have no bluffs if you find like if you find the sizing that he overfalls then you definitely want to bluff have bluffs this is something you need to find out all right stuck in micro says if you bluff just ask yourself what do you need to do to make him fold or to put into perspective to make him fold often enough the bigger you bet the more you need to be sure if you bet half pot and this guy folds one out of two times you're printing money if you bet three times pot and he calls one out of three times you're losing a lot of money. So it's a thing of risk-reward but this is tough to find out. Let's just say Dudie messed up this one because he didn't get the call. Maybe two-thirds would have done the job. Alright, three bet from the small blind. we call pocket nines no other options here we go the out of position 10 percent bet what are you guys doing one for the fold two for the call three for the race and i hope you agree it's a tough spot low frequency four bad not really i mean maybe in some charts Thank you. And I hope you agree it's a tough spot. Low frequency 4-bet, not really. I mean, maybe in some charts. Fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold. Raise. Call. I think raise is the worst option. If you want to raise, you can take something like deuces and threes just you want to unblock something like 10 9 9 8 suited hands that that are folding to erase yeah with deuces you unblock all the folds with nines you block folds only which is bad against 10 i think actually you cannot really fold anything out of your range. Maybe the 5-6 of hearts. So you need to continue. It's the price you got to pay. And then you get another card. And yeah, great that you know you have all sixes in your range still. Folding not allowed, right? So just, yeah, the 9 of clubs, 9x would be the reason for a 25% bet. But 10%, if you fold 9s here, you over folding the shit out of it Okay Ace 3 of diamonds I guess it's not a recreational because the cutoff here is Recreational but obviously this gives incentives to the hijack to also build a flatting range to play against the recreational so this is kind of a weird spot that comes up in those lineups that everyone kind of plays out of range and yeah four-way jack jack ten i think you want to be a little stronger than that i expect to check four-way a nine. I expect a check and somehow I have seen that hand. I expect a check because you have lots of hands that are better. You have like random King X suited that are way better with some outs. I know that he ends up betting small here which I do not really understand. It doesn't fit to what I've seen of that game in the other spots, but it did work out. So I think nothing to go too much into in, in, in death with some theory in the four way pot here with absolute dog shit. But okay. Did work out. Nine eight suited. We get the call. Small small bet 8x plus should be enough 8-8x trips should be enough for for range betting here when they are unconnected so he does that with all his hands turn 10 keeps his range together i think no splits 75 sizing only i think this is now trying to to show you guys a little what is what is going in his strategy brain that he actually cuts down his options here that that or i can i can tell you that i talked enough with him that this is like okay here's the option check or 75 eight nine suited with those trips sure you can sometimes trap trips but they will bet 75 and i'm i'm very very very certain about that and then on the river he will split and have some all-ins some 75% some 150% this is kind of the game tree he's building. Seabed bigger versus recreational is better on pier boards not necessarily you know let them let them catch up with something give them some rope i think that's fine recreational is not recreational there if someone is triggered by that and sometimes check raises you want to go as small as possible if someone plays fit or fold maybe you want to put in some checks if you just crazy over folds yeah i don't like the word they in that context of playing NL 40k plus on nl 50 nl 25 i'm 100 with you because they lack all the bluffs but here maybe it's the the crazy chinese bitcoin guy who is ready to just gamble it off people playing for that those amounts of money they're either looking for the challenge or they absolutely don't care about money so we see that 75 that was predicted and nothing else happened okay six four of hearts again lots of coachings in the member section on those ace broadway low boards where i explain why overbet or check makes a lot of sense you guys can now what Dutti's game plan is. Well I don't know 40k tendencies, I played just a couple of hands on that limit myself, but it just makes a lot of sense to just take those players out of the population tendency that comes from like low and mid stakes likely. Alright you guys know there is no bet big or check. This starts on the turn, so this is a small bet entire range, which also works. It's giving up tiny EV for playing one option only, not thinking on the flop at all, delay everything to the turn and then playing perfectly then instead of opening like double that size game tree. Yeah, that's just the reason. So we see small, we see the call, turn is a five. You guys know now what's happening. There's no other option. Would ace-three-king be a different strategy? In theory, slightly, yes, because the big blind is three betting all ace-k but not all ace Queens just the amount of two pairs that are there for the big blind but for duty here it will be exactly the same strategy. Kepala's bet 75 is obviously massively wrong this I mean this guy doesn't play a full stack so he could adjust and play smaller than 150 But I doubt he's a big hotkey guy Yeah, yeah big big hotkey guy not even adjusting when he's one tabling Okay, I think it's it's nice with the 150 because now it's pretty much 150 left, but it's still the option to bet 75 on the river also. I think not many rivers where you want to do that, but yeah. So what's your play on the river? Let me know. We jamming and I hope you like jamming too. Shove's river for sure. 75 into fold. Flah. Clear jam. Villain doesn't have deuce, axe since no flush draw and we don't have showdown. So ace-deuce is the only deuce villain can have I would say What do we value? Ace-jack or ace-king? I think we need two pair plus Villain sits on so much ace-10, ace-9, ace-8, ace-7 compared to all of that and kind of a Psychological thing always is blocking that river two pair. People are not folding when they improve. It's very nice. So I think the four is pretty great. Also blocking the deuce four that can play like that. Doesn't need to check raise flop. So I think it's a very beautiful jam here with the six four. And I don't think that there is too much 75% existing. Because if we only bet like ace five plus. Maybe ace three also thin ace five plus something like that then then all in is the size and anything else would really surprise me okay I cheat a little because it's already we're almost an hour in and and I just see whether I find some more interesting hand here that I don't want to miss out on this is lots of small pots This is not an interesting one. The 6-4 was interesting This here is kind of interesting Same table still recreational sitting here in the small blind He calls the small blind three way to the flop of Queen Jack Jack just showing showing you this is an interesting hand because i don't know this is the recreational wolf we get a check back here turn a boat get another check back in and get a kind of standard large-ish race actually paid off right so i think the check back is especially nice with a multi with a with a recreational just the option him hitting a straight or something like speaking on the turn now the flop check back i think your hand has two streets value you can easily check back on the turn the check back is interesting because yeah especially against the recreational he might overvalue hands that he makes on the river he might go for crazy over bluffing with a pocket pierce that is not worth anything. We don't know, just mess up slightly. And here it worked out, but tough to talk about that. But seeing this was the recreational flat and king-jack offsuit there. Let's see. Oh, one more. This is a good one to ask a question. 160 big blind steep, something like that. Threebet blind versus blind. We call out of position. 4-bet is also an option. I don't like it too much being deeper. I like that hand with 100 big blinds exactly. For 160, just like a jack high board is not that cool anymore. The ace high board, then stacking off is not that cool anymore. So yeah, the hand really suffers from playing a little deeper so i don't like it too much so i go with the call also check check on ace 10 5 rainbow so someone is not range betting here we can already start putting him on like a range a hand class a part of his range range part turn is a nine um Can we play some limp raise as deep? You can simplify and play raise only or you can play complicated and also have limps. I know Doody only limps. He simplifies obviously again with the raise only and plays limps in the spots with ante. They play the same tables in those stakes with ante also and then you need to limp but yeah simply all simplification all right so still pocket nines totally in big blinds range we have like i don't know do we have two clear streets of value i don't know so it's close between bet and check since my main betting range two pairs plus one over batting no direction all in i think this here is in the middle and then i prefer the check which we see here and villain checks back again now again two things which hands or hand type do you put villain on and what is your river size i want to hear a hand and a size again okay we put him on kings queens jacks or a 10 okay ace deuce ace three ace four bet 75 jacks through Kings and some weak Ace-Axe. 60, 60, 60, 60. Which size are you bluffing here? Guys, if you sit here on 6, 7 suited, 6, 7 of spades, I think you shouldn't bet that on the turn. What's your size then? All right so here we have a different spot I asked the same question on that in that hand versus the recreational where we just said like yeah He has ace high and we can think what is he calling? Against us and what is he folding and we can go max exploitative here We are likely playing one of the best players in the world Which means we need to come up with a strategy that makes sense and I would say here I agree 100% with the hands you guys just mentioned right so I want to give him a challenge exactly those hands because I want to use one sizing for both my bluffs and my value hands so if he is as kept as we think sure he can have river turn running trips but which nine x is he really checking back on the flop so river 10 would be way worse we couldn't bet big on a river 10 but in nine we don't care so kind of we can we can load our gun here i think and get max out of weak ace x or out of those kings queens jacks while our bluffs might go through on the other hand so yeah duty plays hotkeys I expect 100% like sounds stupid 100% frequency betting 150% pot kind of because he does not really use 200 in those spots but I wouldn't hate it someone let's just face it even on high stakes stakes, someone checks back A10-5, he has weak showdown value. Like Ace something or Kings. Let's be that easy. We see exactly that bet. We get the easy call from Ace-2. It's kind of an easy counter as well to then call with an Ace and fold when you have kings-queens just because the ace blocker is kind of nice to influence a bluffing frequency. But yeah, so it's easy. I don't know. I mean, I know Doody very well, who's even better, but all I know is just that he cuts down his option here and he has 0 75 or 150 and i think 75 is just it's just the wrong size here he won't check because you can't check raise that so there's one left and then it's easy right if you cut down your options if you have a game plan like that that's very nice okay so i need to wrap it up here and go help the family and the crying kids. It's really a little painful here in the office here listening to that. Let's see one more out of the session. Losing 50 now, 40, not interesting, not interesting. Did you follow the cash game championship on coin poker and would it be possible to see you playing in such an event in the future? If there will be a similar event? I followed a little, just the results. Actually, I want to do some commentary, but didn't find time. I think I won't be playing in that. I need to be more selective. It's actually me having not much time against people who invest like every hour they are awake in their poker game. I think I'm in a state now where I can understand what they are doing and I could do the same, but I can't because I don't have the time. So I feel like I understand most stuff, but they are playing on a different level. So I would probably the table that we have seen Dutys sit on, I could play this one with a clear big recreational and then playing slightly too tight against the very good players should make some good money. So this is what I would, in my life situation, would need to look for, look out for. Yeah, I won't have time this week either. Maybe if there's one more week next week, but I think it will be tough. So yeah, I'm in touch with actually Kaki T and who does, I think the summaries and Johan hosts the show, Todd, but yeah it's tough. It's 10k, NL 10k. Alright let's close it with the biggest hand he played maybe. Net won, net lost. Just 100k. Okay that's a boring hand. Anyways that's the biggest ante 500 1k with a big ante in the middle king five suited open race he plays against the recreational i remember that hand three way we check it down turn flush draw check it down river at the second nut flush recreational bad spot Thank you. strong check it down river at the second nut flush recreational bad spot we race to 40k and face the jam hey against the recreational i don't know i don't know all right so enough fun for today i want to end all that with as i said not with this one with key takeaways so my learning i was clicking through some more hands also was really don't get crazy over aggressive being motivated by like i need to win those hands really find the spots like just the big first don't mess up is the biggest learning today to play really good just don't mess up and the second know where your money comes from look for your fights i think the biggest most interesting thing was the 5-6 offsuit and the ace-8 offsuit defend big blind versus hijack because it was a recreational player that was the the biggest money makers whether you play that queen 10 offsuit aggressively the first hand or you just fold it on the flop doesn't matter too much i think this is the biggest learning that maybe maybe table selection as well that you find the spot on your table and if not you can just leave and you do not only try to find that table but when playing you also try to find the weaker players that you can really get the money from. So yeah I hope you enjoyed that one I'll see you in the Poker Code Discord and in the video section as soon as possible. Would be really happy if some of you who aren't a member yet get a member and the others obviously stay with us and see you for the next one. Next month will be i don't know who does the public coaching but i will be talking in it with for the members only again and then until then have a beautiful christmas and happy new year guys bye
