### TOPIC: cash hand review 16
 let's go to keep the structure as it is for all the other coaches coachings that we are not getting lost even if it's just a casual hand history review it's actually a very important thing i kept the structure like that so quickly we'll talk about the spot which will be very easy as always in those cases i will talk about the three questions that hopefully all of you guys know i'll talk quickly about awareness when talking about hand histories and then i want to show you again ways of analyzing so for people who are maybe newer in poker code or haven't watched all the videos i did a couple of things there especially using gto wizard it's on the dashboard and you can find it i guess in the like there is like a gto wizard special how to use GTO wizard and this is actually not only for GTO wizard but it's more like for reviewing and hand histories and so on and then as always I'll leave you with some key takeaways after obviously discussing a couple of hands so we have one hand that I thought is very interesting not necessarily because of the hand but because of the beautiful way it got presented and the beautiful answer that led to here in discord so i want to show that as a beautiful example then danzu was so kind to deliver a couple of hands after i asked for that i took three of his hands and i played a bit myself for fun yesterday just to create some situations and I chose two hands out of that where I want to look at those in a slightly different way all right if there are any questions as always drop it in the chat we are just 10 people right now so I see all your questions you can ask me anything let's spot, very easy. We will need five seconds for that. We play the hand we're unsure about in a certain way. Actually, this is the five seconds, but I want to go a little deeper. There are different ways of analyzing. We can go really deep or we can just check, did I play that fine? And so on. They're like, oh, there's a middle ground of that obviously as well what do we want to analyze what are we unsure about to really put that into words once you're capable of doing that you're discussing on a whole other level right it's so easy to just ask can you tell me something about this hand and present the hand history i could write books about a hand probably i mean would be stupid books but like i could write a lot and go into every direction if you ask me certain things like what do you think how do people react here what do you think is the right play for my range does that sizing make sense for this hand specifically like there are so many things in one hand history actually to talk about that I like you guys to nail it down. And the better you are capable of nailing things down, the easier you make it for people that want to help you. And the better your answers are getting. We'll see that later. So which helps you a lot to really cut things down are those three questions because they guide you through every single hand right so i will repeat them as i do very very often this is my way of thinking in every single hand what would be right you can call it gto you can call it whatever your right like it's your right to do simplifications if you tell me this is how you want to play that's also that is your right then and we start here that's okay then what is villain doing wrong to go into the exploitative part and then to know what is the right exploit right to make money we need villains to do something wrong if you if you play people who are not making mistakes you just stand up and leave. So people are doing something wrong. If not, don't play. And then we need to figure out what is the right exploit. And this helps you to know how to ask the right questions. Are you asking about what would be right? Obviously, not every one of us has GTO Wizard or using PIO or, or I don't know, like just we don't know shit, right? And we can ask other people that either have that or that have more knowledge and so on. We can ask people about, well, what population tendencies about their impression, what is what is going on here? Or just like you have a certain read and you're unsure about how to exploit people in the right way. What would you do here? And so on. It's very, very different questions that you could ask for the same hand history, which leads to very, very different answers. So the people that answer your questions usually have no clue. Like if you don't tell them, what are you interested in? Now, that's very, so maybe we get through more hands today because i feel like we get through a bit so i want to talk about ways of analyzing also this is the ones that i presented in the kind of gto wizard extra the first one is the quick fix let's call it right it's just after a session you can ask yourself did i mess up and then you can really post the hand history. And it's not about going into detail. It's like, is it an absolute blunder or is it somewhat fine? Is it like thumbs up, thumbs down? Like not going to detail. It's okay. It's okay. Don't worry. Then let's say way of analyzing can be the discussion, right? An open discussion that you just ask people. Ask people what is your opinion on something specific, right? So just like, what do you think? What are people doing here? What do you think? How would people react if I do something crazy like that? Do you expect people to overbluff, to underbluff here? Whatever, right? How would you think they are reacting to certain sizings? And so on and so on. Then we have the spot review, which is like we look at a certain spot and have multiple hands of that, right? You keep the spot the same and you review that over and over. This really helps you to get better in one spot. And then the very typical one, I i just call it the hand in death is what we see if we are like typically talking about hand histories it's like trying to talk about everything a bit and usually this is done just like street by street right if you get better and know more about your strategy you can talk through the whole hand at the same time a little more it's not like my flop play was good my turn play was good no you have a plan for all the way like how you build things but yeah this is kind of like i call it the hand in death it's like what you expect usually when we say we're looking at hand histories all right i think that was it for now and we look at the first hand why not it's it's a lot on that screen I didn't know how to present that in a good way but this is a hand by Dennis I don't know whether he's in here but I guess Dan Zhu is in here who gave a great answer so this is a hand I'll let's can I open it I guide you through the hand quickly so the cutoff open raises to 3x on anti-table. So that's like fine, I guess. Not too much into those games. Button calls and we are in the big blind with 4-5 offsuit. I guess it's very loose. Standard should be the fold, especially with a button being involved, having all the pocket peers. And then our 4-5 does better against an under the gun range maybe and nothing else but like someone having pocket eights pocket sevens pocket sixes and so on doesn't help us but yeah i mean how bad can it be we can argue with post flop edge and bad players and so on and so on we get backdoor flush draw plus double gutter on the flop and it gets checked around turn the jack kind of random obviously someone can have jacks but that's that's about it. More of a brick, nothing yeah it's kind of a brick like no straights no flush no nothing and we from the big blind having a double gutter having a spade seems like a reasonable hand to bet and I think big bet size here here is pretty good I like it we bet big we river our straight but the flush gets there after just the open razor calls we bet big again kind of polarized we're saying like maybe not only flush but like straight plus maybe set plus something like that and bet and we face the jam and end up folding all right so now I just want to quickly read maybe in a shortcut what Dennis wrote down. Where did I put it here? Okay, I have a question about the spot on the board. So he makes lots of assumptions about how others play. For my taste, this is too much. I don't want to read out the whole thing, just summarize it a bit. He says like people are always c-betting where he should actually he said people should c-bet every flush draw and so on so he discounts lots of that and when he thinks things through actually he wants to call for that reason i think in the end i'm not sure it kind of sounds like it which yeah it's already it feels like results biased a bit so and then he ends up asking questions which this is why i pulled out this hand history because it makes it so easy to answer so he has all his descriptions about his thoughts perfect and then he asks the question for me is what range raises a pot-sized bet on the river first question second question is his race on the river more value or bluff heavy third how would you decide the river actually second and third is the same question if he's bluff heavy we would obviously call if he's value heavy we would always obviously fold so two questions right which range can raise a pot size bet on the river so pot size here meaning that we polarize already and represent strength like definitely set plus like i think a week two pair is not strong enough so the question is like how strong does villain need to be to raise here like he has kind of the idea that maybe just not flushes which would say he should always jam he was not jamming here maybe it's like king high flushes queen high flushes it's probably not the five high flush right so it's a very interesting question right he has a clear question instead of tell me something about the hand and then the second question is very very very clear what is villain doing wrong he okay, villain is not playing perfectly. So he will be either value heavy or he will be bluff heavy. And that obviously helps big time. And then we get a perfect answer, right? From Danzu, who is here. Hi, Dennis, my thoughts about that hand. I actually would fold four or five, even more against two villains. I agree with that. Flop, I guess it should be a mix. Mix is always correct. So there is no always in those multi-way spots. So obviously villains should have flush draws in a checking range. This is just more of a beginner's level of thinking that he has a flush draw, he bets. No, he has a lot of different flush draws and some should bet, some should not. In turn, I would actually see quite some ace-axe which check flop. I think Dennis said an ace-axe would also bet, top pair bets, which is not necessarily true, especially in a multiway pot. Correct. River, on the stakes I play. So now we're talking about the level of exploitative plays. So he mentions what he plays. Perfect answer. This is why I like it so much. If someone is playing in a 5 and someone in a 1000, it might be different. On the stakes, I play in a 25. This is mostly value heavy. And I would only consider calling with clear reads. I actually like villain size. It would be interesting if he would have gone all in if he would have had it interesting point right is he bluff heavy when he goes smaller and greedy when he has it we don't know so far he says population in his games is value heavy here my experience tells me yes i agree with that and i actually like the fold it's way easier to over call that because you have a straight and then you level yourself into it because you have a spade and so on at least you have the read that villain is capable of that bluff right so boom can't bluff for big pots using blocker great note right maybe it comes up again unlike the on lower stakes that you see those people over and over again but it's a note that doesn't hurt and can help you big time. So great thing, great questions. And I hope you feel it also that those questions, the way he asked it really helped Dan Zhu to give him good answers. What I like here, and I want you guys to really take for yourself the clear questions. How thin can Villain go for value? Do we expect Villain to be bluff value heavy? Great questions lead to great answers. So really, you as someone who asks for like hand histories, you have it in your hands how good answers are getting. Actually, you can ask like not that experienced players. If you ask them the correct way, you get also very good answers.'s insane throughout my my coaching career how good of answers you can get from people who are not that experienced but just the the way of asking if you ask more detailed like very clear questions you always get good answers because it's just it's a game of logic if you ask like what would you how would you play that hand it's just too much for beginners maybe right so it's really you have it in your hands to get great answers all right so now we get to the next hands and let me see i didn't have have the GTO wizard subscription yesterday. So I asked them to renew it for me. And I think it worked out now because if not, I need to run some pile on the side to show some stuff. But I think we can use the shortcut and we got it now. Okay. So let's go to hand number two, which is actually hand one by Dan Zhu. he posted like hand one, two, three in one bucket and then like in one thread, hand four and five in another. I just went for one, two, three. And yeah, here we have the first problem in a way that he doesn't ask a clear question. Right. So let me see. I wanted to. Where did I put it? To show you also. stupid to talk about something that you guys can't see. Right? So let's read it first. Oh, no. Right. Send it here. One second. I get it. It's a video. We watch the video first. And number one. Boom. I hope it works. All right. So I got you through it. We open raise ace-king offsuit. Big blind. We are 130 big blinds deep. Three bets to nine so far, so standard. We three bet to 22. I think GTO Wizard uses three big blinds, 10 big blinds, 21 big blinds. We get a call. Flop. We go for, I don't know, maybe this is a range bet, maybe not, a small sizing. Big blind calls, turns the queen, we end up checking. Big blind checks back, river we check again, face somewhat normal bet size, we rip it and have the cooler on our side. Beautiful. All right, so let's see. Beautiful hand, but so far we're not talking about the hand. We talk about the hand history. Hand one, small blind versus big blind. So let's see how Danzu presented, right? I don't want to needle anyone, right? It's just, I want everyone to learn, right? So he describes the hand, which is beautiful. As we're both a bit deeper i go for a slightly bigger four bet all right i just give you my first instinct now i think it's not really bigger if you see like you could like in gto wizard you have the option to go to 150 big blind stack death then would go like really really large just the positional advantage gets way bigger plus the price kind of set value plus a bit more EV for like those those pockets get get better, this ASX suited in position and so on. So you need you need a bigger size when you are deeper, I think like for 130 big blinds, the 922 is too small, but not a big deal. And flop. Oh, he says range bet with small sizing, right what would be right he gave me his right if we put in gto wizard ace king will often be a bigger bet i would say but the simplification of betting everything small is absolutely fine right this is your game to simplify and then have a better game on the turn without losing ev for sure all right turn as villain was more on the nitty side i guess his range is around jack ten suited ace queen ace ten ace queen king queen king jack hindsight i'm thinking if it might usually be better to charge his possible straight draws already on the turn if you show me this range and you're freaking crushing it and all that has equity yes absolutely right it's just a coincidence but it pops up in my head i prefer everyone to be a positive thinker not because it's more combos just because this is your goal in that hand start with the ace queen offsuit this is what you want him to have because that kind of triggers you write down jack 10 suited and first instinct is oh he might have a straight which yes yes he can sure but it's more likely he has freaking something that we are crushing and we win the stack so not saying he should fold at any point but actually you gave him a chance to get away i mean you could probably jam pocket kings also and he's ahead of that or the same hand ace queen is really but it's like really a little fancy play syndrome just betting against that range whether he folds some equity or he calls and is crushed both is great for us on the river i was actually playing against ace queen in my mind i like that and thought how to get the max out the max is the stack whatever you should get no matter what you do with the stack in i'm not sure if even a really nitty villain might find the fold button with this hand. No, no, no. You might have the same hand or actually worse. So yeah, it's not what we see is no clear question. Makes it tough for me. If you watch carefully, you feel it, right? I don't know what to really talk about. I give a little ideas. You talked about the turn optional bet. So I jump a little on that and say that and say yes i'm a big fan of the turn bet i think it's a very clear turn bet and yeah the questions would help me that you show a little more about your thinking right the more i know about your thinking the better i can help you right so i know where are you struggling, where not, right? You are talking about the turn. This is what I pick up. I don't know whether the flop sizing is in any way interesting for you. We could discuss that a little more. I don't know whether the river decision of checking is very interesting for you or where your other options, maybe think about block betting or overbet jamming, just more ideas of what you're actually thinking about that allows me to help you with makes it better. So tough to answer. I can go in any direction. So for those type of fans, when it's not a clear question, actually, if it's not this coaching, right, where I go a little more in depth to show you things, I go for the quick fix. It's really like just a thumbs up thing. Like, yeah, for me, it seems a little too fancy. And the turn that should be the clear play would be my if i see the hand just as it is in discord this is my answer you get a short answer because i cannot go in every direction in death right you need to guide me a little where you want to be going so let me see i close the discord check chat okay that the right thing now we obviously want to use that hand and also look it up right so let's see this seems reasonable small blind small blind raise big blind okay it's raising to 10 21 whatever right so we can call we get the ace king what was it this is King, six. So multiple sizings would be fine. Ren and Pio actually end. This is king six All right, so multiple sizings would be fine. I ran it in PIO Actually, and there was more of the big sizing and this very small wasn't allowed So actually the 10% would be a thing also, but range betting this is absolutely fine This is something we can take away from that ace king six turn was a queen I don't know whether there was a flush draw or not, I don't care. And AK, actually for that, it's rainbow. Let's keep it rainbow. It's like 80%, 85% bet. I prefer that. You said he's kind of nitty, give him the chance to rather call or fold equity. If he folds KJ, it's also fine for you. Way better than a check and here you see money money is coming from oh i'm sorry wrong wrong window wrong screen thank you all right so let's repeat that flop 10 is a thing here to just attack pocket period and like absolute misses the tighter villain is the more he connects with that board so i like the bigger size could even see something bigger than 25 to be honest and this is absolutely fine range betting this is fine turn offsuit queen i show it again 80 85 percent of betting with that hand i think this should be yeah this is again 2e is offered. So it's in between the 25 and the 50. 2e will be in between of those numbers. This is where the money comes from. If you check that people has 4-5 backdoor and turns it into a bluff, has 5-6 suited, 6-7, sometimes turns his queen 10 into a bluff. Like, yeah. So I think because you mentioned he's a little bit tighter, it's another reason for the bet for me. And then we just go all the way. And now here it's tough to go for the stack death. I could go 150, but then preflop is very, very different. So I think people for 130 people, means exploitative thoughts, are more playing the same like 100 100 and if you would have sized up accordingly your spr would be similar to 100 also river was it an ace who cares ace yes and then what was that after check check you have more or less a mandatory check just because yeah it makes so much sense it's very likely villains full shit and would be like that even more if we were deeper and yeah after that i don't like the turn bet sizes this is why i actually want to stop here it's like i really don't want to look at that and after betting i think this will be a jam and i'm so wrong so yeah okay you should be checking and where's the money coming from queen 10 is getting turned into a bluff yeah i doubt all that shit ace jack is value betting all day long seven six is calling turn yeah again if we double check where's the money coming from i doubt a lot of things so i'm actually overruling that and i want to jam okay so we talked about a couple of things about the The way the hand is presented. Has nothing to do with the hand. Just you see how I struggle in which direction I want to comment things. And now you've seen the quick fix. Seems a little too fancy term. That should be the clear play. It's 85% GTO wizard. We can go through that shit I clearly prefer it but that should be should be somewhat fine all right any any questions for all the others you can jump in if you think the hand is interesting anything we have the time for that right so if there's anything you want to want to hear more about or have me double check that's your chance a couple of people writing so I wait a bit yeah I wasn't indeed too unspecific with the questions actually just want to provide some hands for the session today which is great right i'm i'm not not hunting you down on not delivering perfect like hand histories to have questions so i just try to make clear that if people want to get feedback they have it in their hands to get the perfect feedback. Alright let's continue. Hand 3, let's watch the video. Where is it? Hand 3 is actually your hand 2. Alright beautiful. 10 for a suited. We We go for a very light 3-bet. Big bet on the flop. 5-3 deuce with a flush draw. Overbet turn jam on that jack. Let's do that for the chat now. A quick fix. Just thumbs up or a thumb stone. You can write anything, like good, bad, whatever. Just is it a good play, is it not? I didn't check GTO Wizard myself. I just like old school, I just made up my mind. Button raise, big blind, large three bet. You won't see the 10-4 suited in that range. That's not Dan Zhu mentions that he's it's very, very very light three bet but we can definitely look at something like king four suited or whatever right or something elusive channel pretty too ambitious post okay any more opinions yale approves i think villain folds that's a good guess i don't know the checkers raise will be better, we get something but when he check check we still realize equity. Not sure but feel like solver hates to jam when he has a bunch of calls that dominate your heart like ace of spades, axe of spades. Okay, beautiful. So again, let's have a quick look. You can go big only, I don't know, actually I ran it in PIO but it's interesting that it's very different ranges now in gto wizard i just opened it up it is big only usually the 532s because your ace x do so can go some smaller also this the reason is this 2.5 to 13 this very very large big blind 3 bet which is like a more polarized range than the ones that i have saved in pio i just looked up the board whether that exists that sizing and there was very very much lots of small bedding also or a mix of everything and now i get kind of overruled by gto wizard with those ranges that it's yes some third pot but we don't give a shit about that actually some some smaller some middles mainly right? So that's absolutely fine if you say it's a big, bad board. We can look at the jack-4 suited maybe. Will be bad on the turn, though. Queen-4 has the overcard extra. But this is something we see here, right? So let's have a look at the spades. Queen-4 prefers the check. Jack-4 prefers, I mean, it's indifferent, but mainly checks. checks king four goes for like 60 checking also which maybe if there are some mtt players they know that from shorter stacks that you can really rank your hands by how much are you into seeing more cards and here it's very easy that your hand loves seeing more cards so you do not necessarily want to open up something where you put out chances to not see all the cards i would mainly check that for that reason and you can play perfectly on turn river and you realize your equity we have who was in the chat also said the check race will be better on the turn is an option also we get something but when he check check we still realize equity so we love the check check see a card have either a freaking 10 high nothing or have a very very strong hand that we do not have often in that spot right having a four is beautiful if the river is an ace or a six or something like that and yeah So just seeing more cards, so I'm a big fan of that let's have a look how this range all right again i can go in different directions and i just choose myself what i want to present here or what i think might be interesting is to have a look at hands that have that plan of betting big and then jam the turn you can can think about the turn already. So let's make a game for the chat also. Give me one value hand that prefers that line and give me one not value hand that prefers that line also. I have two in mind, Queens, right? So Queens, Kings, if the turn is not a Jack, Jacks, Jacks, Queens, Kings, right? Every card. Value is very, very, very straightforward. What is your turn bluffs? If it's not the 10-4 of spades. Ace-5 is whatever. It's in between. You get called by 4-5, you fold out pocket 8s. Let's say hands. Let's say hands that are not clear value. So we don't need bluffs. We need hands that are not clear value. 4-5. Let's see. Let's do that big bet. We see obviously here highest frequency big bets are actually like 10s and jacks. And then on that turn, jack. 10s are the first hand that are just always jamming. Fuck that jack, who cares? You got nines and eights and five six and four five and ace five and ace x of spades and so on. And now we really need to look for something that also uses that all in battle. And this is interesting. We see freaking ace queen offsuit. Actually, I wonder why it's the ace of spades. I would have thought that it's always the ace queen or ace king also without the ace of spades just to get those ace 10, ace 9, ace 8, ace 7 of spades calls in that we dominate. I can absolutely see this ace of clubs, queen of hearts here. This is a freaking good jam. You have still six outs against any peer, against any jack and so on, and you are ahead of something. The ace five was a great mention. Whether it's value or not, we don't know. We jam and have an EV of 17 big blinds. I mean, we definitely don't hope to get called. 7-6 doesn't bet big on the flop. Seems like it. What happened here? Why does... Oh, here. Yeah, never bets big. Oh, I got the 4 also with ace-queen. So, yeah, it's a beautiful hand. So, I'm really wondering about the suits. I would have always went with no diamond and no ace of spades. Would have been my first preference. I don't know why the ace of spades is so much better. Okay. Because villain jams that on the flop. That explains it, right? I wanted to get called by that. If it jams the flop, I can't get called by it on the turn anymore so that makes a lot of sense okay so let's go to that very quick fix you gave that we prefer the hand to play somewhat differently it's the i have equity i get it in which is never too bad out of position but we would have learned a lot through seeing more cards and also it's a beautiful river bluff on bricks all right because it's a hand that hits if spade gets there it's great for villain's range but great for our hand if an ace or six hits it's great for villain's range but in this case for our hand which means that if we do not hit with our 10-4 of spades then usually it hits our range which makes then our hand a great bluff but if the rubber is a king or a queen for example and that's just beautiful right or even a nine just a brick is also okay like those and then you kind of like it was tough to put in words right because i didn't look things up i thought myself like i think this is a beautiful bluff if like especially that king queen maybe also nine hits to to have them all right cool the learning here is my handmade for three streets or not this is something actually i learned that the most when i trained like 40 big blind mtt three bad pots where this two street game very very often happens i just read about 40 big blinds you bet like half pot and then jam the turn where you very often have the decision do i play for two streets with a small bet starting on the flop or for three streets with a small bet or a check where do i play for two streets for to bet bigger now to have that turn option Thank you. or for three streets with a small bet or a check? Or do I play for two streets to bet bigger now to have that turn option? And this is what we do here when we talk about big sizing on the flop. We know we have that turn option whether it's a pot bet or a slide over bet, who cares? So it's kind of the same thing and we only want to use hands that do not learn a lot by cards. It's like here, pocket tens. Whether the turn is a jack or a queen or a six or an eight, we don't know whether it's good. I mean, offsuit eight is pretty good, but we just don't learn a lot. If we have ten four of spades, we know that spade is freaking good, that ace is freaking good, that six is freaking good, and that actually a ten is also also very good it's fine for us to see more cards and then make decisions instead of making decision now and then let the board run okay anyways thanks for that hand also very interesting hand again coming back to the topic awareness right we had a four bet pot now blind versus blind and now we have a blind versus button three bet pot very different situations this is something for you with the database to to filter for that now would be if you're more into that the perfect time to just double check big blind versus button three bet pots go through 50 hands write down your flop strategies big only big and big and check only small size only range bet and so on and then continuations on the turn right and then you learn more about patterns patterns patterns to have it available for you while playing in game right four bad pot small blind versus big blind it's always tough to have one hand but if you have 10 or 20 and the pattern repeats same what we do with like GTO wizard drills, you get better so, so fast. Okay, let's see hand number four, which is third hand by Dan Zhu. Oh, beautiful. So because I love to see that because it's now big blind versus hijack three bet pot. We go again for a very light three bet. Forcing it, I love that's exactly the way when i play for you guys on zoom 100 to get some hands in a little little over the top but a suited king how bad can it be a good sizing let's go from there half pot on that board absolutely reasonable you mentioned even that you make the decision that you can do quite a bit on that board don't know who it is really better for there's no straight there's no nothing our queens kings aces are still crushing obviously he hits sets but if it's just that there are no two pairs there are lots of draws and so on we can put pressure on and then we hit this king turn right so you continue with a half pot bet villain calls and the river is a brick? I think so, right? It's kind of a brick. How much like 9-8 suited is a brief up fold 7-8 suited mainly also could ace 8 is it folding on the turn? I think likely 8-x of diamonds doesn't exist so it's kind of brick. All the draws bust and you kind of have a feeling here. We'll talk about your comments in a second that We'll be right back. think likely eight eggs of diamonds doesn't exist so it's kind of brick all the draws bust and you kind of have a feeling here we'll talk about your comments in a second that it's not good enough for value it's just a bit over half pot bet and you take this as a bluff catcher i think no chance we can fold the turn top here that would be super nitty all right let's read danzu's thoughts here i just read it here you don't need that much text pre-flop i love that i went for another three bet bluff i'm loving it so and i think this actually makes a lot of money i don't know the the stakes here it's some big blinds but like pretty much any stakes this is printing as long as you are somewhat unknown flop hijack should have more sets but i still think both might not hit the flop very well. Not hitting well means the guy who had the advantage before keeps the advantage, which is you. So I decided to go for the c-bet because of the backdoor flush draw. Now we can't range bet here with that sizing, so if we have king three of spades we need to freaking check for all that. King three of clubs is close but I'm fine, right? if we have king six with additional straight equity we bet it it's fine turn i decided to go for another c bet to charge his draws jack x kind of the street by street thinking there was no plan for the whole hand which ends up being a little troublesome we will hear it now you feel it i actually hadn't river i actually hadn't a good feeling on the river usually a sign i messed up somewhere i don't like my c-bet on the turn now guess the call in the river might be fine sometime as villain might bluff some misdraws not sure though yes you have a random bluff catcher but you block a king the one with the backdoor that he should continue. You block value, don't block a single bluff. If you fold that, you're just like folding every time you check here. So no way I'm folding that. Actually, I think as played, it's still a value gem. But yeah, if people are playing loose and aggressive as they should, yeah, and on most stakes, it's just it's a random bluff catcher, but it's the best we get. Yeah. So the question is now for the chat. Danzo has the feeling that every one of us knows that he gets into a spot with half pot or a little more left on the river. And he feels like any option he has is bad. And he has that feeling that he made a mistake. Try and maximize against Jack-X and don't overthink, right? If we expect that people can call down with Jack-X, just put it in. It's really tough for like half-bought to go for value too thinly. Pre-3-bet too ambitious again. I mean, okay, we can take a look at the 3-bet, like how ambitious can bluffs be, right? It's like, if people are over-folding, this is making money. If people are not over-folding, it's maybe not making money. But actually, let's see, I thought it's a little higher the king-x suited. We have freaking GTO playing this shit out of them, so it's not too ambitious. And 12.3, yeah? Depends on player type, yes, that's always true. I don't think they are overfalling 20, 25, even another 25. Maybe not preflop, but then they are very likely doing that postflop. Let's check 85. So half pot seems like a very, very reasonable sizing. King three we see some traces of it some traces i said king six will be fine right some additional equity king seven even better so it's a stretch but with the assumption that people in general are overfolding that's that's cool so king of hearts ah no i don't want to show it. We take something else. And the rubber is freaking I don't know which like every card there are no real bricks, right? So people need to call on every ace eight here, people need to call down 50% of their ace King suited 30% of the ace King people need to call down down their ace five. I just want to make an argument that in those spots, if people are not overfolding preflop, they are overfolding postflop. And this is kind of a database thing that people study over and over all those, how you call those, those tables. They do that. They all go with overaggression on average because the average is overfolding somewhere. Maybe not preflop. I don't know. Maybe the feeling of betting three streets is scary, but in the end, it's a half-pot river bet with top pair. Yes. You feel like shit if it goes check, check, and he shows down jack, ten. Yes. Absolutely. Maybe it's a little too ambitious. And now I want to show what the correct play would have been. Because the king gives us beautiful options. The king hits hits our range so much and if we think about our range and not only having a king now it's pretty clear what we want to aim at villain has something like pocket sixes and sevens with a diamond villain has something like pocket nines and pocket tens and we want to give them a shit life if we bet half pot here they just fold and have an easy life right what's saying we bet half pot they fold fold fold okay they don't have a6 a7 they fold the clubs ace 10 of clubs as a fold ace queen of clubs actually sometimes calls okay but easy life right the tougher life is if we size down which if a card is very good for our range we are allowed to do and this is what we see here that just we we range but actually small more or less and this kind of gives you the option on the river then right so we size down he has trouble with all his hands it's way tougher for him to defend and the river is an eight and now you can do exactly reach the pot size you want right let's say we have the king three of diamonds you can bet like 30 again options are missing i would prefer 25 on the turn and then another 25 here it seems a little greedy 35 again but it's a reasonable bet size that you have you still have room with a smaller turn size for different river options and the king allows you to bet high frequency with that small sizing and i think this would take your bad feeling away so it's a pretty clear example for i mean it's an, this having a big bet first, then reacting to a very good card and using small bets. Usually we increase sizing always, right? We start often with small sizes and then we polarize later. Here it's the other way around. This is why lots of people do not have that in their arsenal. But it makes so much sense if we think about, okay, which kind of direction, which pot pot size are we aiming at and you had the perfect hand that feels actually pretty good about like half pot block bet block bet all right just this is exactly what you can should extract of a jack right a jack needs to freaking call i think maybe not the worst jack queen jack ace jack needs to call sometimes turn into bluff okay let's open beautiful hand right position you put yourself in with a big blind three bet and because i mentioned the spot review a couple of times i'm a big fan of this multiple hands out of one one group out of one cluster we had here two big blind three bets two very different plays like the turnover bet jam we talked about that when should we do that when not here at the turn beautiful card the downsize lots of concept all right okay it's five to four already but i have two more hands prepared let's go hand five is one that i played i think i make it easy i have it open here where is it which one ace eight and I tried to put questions into words right so that makes it easier for you guys let's have a look at the hand first I got ace eight off suit I open race someone calls flop I say what is right for me here I know it's not but I wanted to just range bet. Again, I'm playing lower stakes than I would actually play. So I want to put more bets out there, more chances for fold equity, more chances for them doing something wrong. Like not check raising enough is a mistake, defending wrongly, calling now to fold later. This is why I like it, right? But I say I betting here fuck it i bet small you won't find that in gto wizard but it's absolutely okay if you only offer that he calls turns a five there will be lots of beautiful rivers for me the ace of hearts for me triggers a little i always like to have the turn card the suit of the turn cards to unblock all the backdoors from the flop i'm not blocking any spades that he is chasing on the flop to now fold i'm not blocking one card diamonds that call the flop and fold now so ace of hearts is one of the first aces i like going crazy with and when we think about which ace x are we betting we have scut shots like ace queen ace 10 but they have showdown value and then we usually start from the bottom right that we want to start with ace four maybe ace seven something like that ace eight i know in that moment it's not a gto play i'm very sure of that in game i played that session yesterday i was very very sure but i said like i think it's important that people definitely overfold after calling a small bet i made that decision for myself and i went even two times pot right the five doesn't really hit two pairs he shouldn't have five six offsuit not jack five offsuit not king five offsuit so i can go very very big if i want he calls river is best card in the deck for me more or less. Q10 gets there, main draw. 10-9 Q9 hit a peer that I'm definitely checking back. 7-8 gets there, beautiful. And now there's only one option. And we all know the option. All right, so now my question to you guys was in my opinion this hand. Are people on NL100 over overfolding enough to make the over aggression a good idea right and here it's just this is something i cannot look up really so i need people who play that who think about that right and here it would be perfect to not do a spot review or anything to just have a discussion going like yes no no because yes because this is how they play yes they always check raise their two pair plus they are not protected and so on they don't find the check jams against your 2x pot size you realize your ace x i don't know everything are good it's opinions it's opinions that right? We can obviously look at a little more stuff and see like, okay, how far? This is for me always interesting. If I do a conscious exploit, how far are we off? It's tough now because this sizing should not really be a thing that I use. It would be better to look it up at PIO and only offer a small bet because we will see lots of big betting and checking here I hope I'm right the small bet is not really a thing an ace eight not not really really call the five of hearts I think heart is fine and then having one diamond the ace of hearts eight of diamonds should be okay maybe that we see that just you see like i'm working through my patterns right i have a shithand i go for suit selection i'm happy that i see that this 175 exists ace eight offsuit my suits are a stretch ace of hearts eight of clubs but it's not horrible it's not horrible so ace of hearts eight of diamonds would be absolutely fine so we are not far off which gives me the impression it's an okay exploit if i have some reasons for that and then on the nine river what was it nine of clubs ace eight now having diamond is bad but i think there's one it's not really a thing here we can look at the ace of spades eight of hearts and this one is it is a clear jam like that no fuck oh we found it okay i said i want to see the full picture here that we see that ace eight without diamond now is actually a beautiful jam i mean we're jamming 43 and we have nothing so how bad can it be actually making some money okay so tough i feel like the overfolding happens on the turn and river landing range is a little stronger than it should be actually my question was about the turn i think i make money on the turn and the river they got me with the best river in the deck i I would have given up on like a 4, 3, deuce, 5, 6, king, jack, ace, obviously, and would have jammed the queen 10, 9, I guess. And that's about it. And obviously give up on diamonds. So it's kind of the river. It's just because of the card. I think I'm fine with that. But the turn is the interesting points. This is why I asked specifically that. Would you do the same line on high stakes? No. Against some players with a read, but not as like population tendency, people are randomly over-folding. Now let's have a quick look. What does Willem need to call? Do we expect that to happen? 30% King-10, 50% Queen-Jack offsuit. Woody does a good point that probably some Queen queen jack offsuit are folding on the turn. So I'm missing river folds. King eight, 50% call. King nine sometimes fold. King nine will never fold if they river a two pair. Jack seven sometimes call. Who knows? Pocket fives only calling turn. And now calling off so i'm actually quite happy but this is something just an explanation how you could in another way discuss a hand and how it much how much it helps to have a clear question turn prints people fast play flops too much and turn is easy to hammer on absolutely and the hand is fine i think having an ace is nice unblocking the right things is nice sometimes being ahead against the suited diamond ace it's also okay right check check we don't have zero ev on the river i would say hitting an eight is an okay out also right we have lots of five x of diamonds that exist so it's like it's an okay hand it's not random okay let's go to the last hand i prepared let's actually just show to you here i again have a clear question i show the hand first jack ten offsuit we have a hijack open race i defend jack ten offsuit flop top here he He goes half pot, over half pot slightly, interesting, I call, I turn a beautiful hand, beautiful card, he checks the 10 back, he goes bigger than the small bet, now he checks the 10, this is weird, river is the king, what is the right river game plan with my range range so it's not spot review to look at lots of river check raises but i just call it spot review because we look at the full range what am i check raising the king is obviously very good card for for in position we need check raises we have a little ace queen ourselves not too much after the big bet i but the ones with the backdoor flush draw, do we three bet them all the time? I don't know. We have lots of two pairs. We have lots of six X, five X, jack X, some king X. It's tough. It's good for a villain, the card, so we should do lots of checking, some check raising. What do we do with our hand exactly so let's make it easy and just i'll ask you guys what are you doing with jack 10. jack 10 just type in what you do check raise 3x now you see what i did here i can tell you this is not correct but yeah size up flop is probably a bit more polarized which means i see less checkbacks river so i look for check raise versus bet 50 or call versus bomb i will go for 50 bet i suspect see a lot of checkbacks so i want Thank you. which means I see less checkbacks reverse. So I look for check raise versus bet 50 or call versus bomb. I will go for 50% bet. I suspect see a lot of checkbacks, so I want from villain some calls. I only saw after. So yeah, interesting, right? I went in-game, I was like, so clear, okay, this is like, we don't have more lookalike principle than that. I'm checking every 10 I'm having. I'm checking every jack I'm having. So how in this world am i not checking jack 10 but already having that thought like check calling is somehow not enough money and i know at the same time villain is incredibly uncapped and villain should check back some like king jack king 10 obviously on the turn and i know in theory this check race is too greedy usually i don't have a 50 check race this was the greedy one like just his timing and so on it was like he has either ace x nothing ace four of hearts or something like that as kairudi said like very polarized or he has the river king like his snap check back i didn't see king like someone is not sizing up with king jack to then check back the 10 like no so it was like a a bit, and I got the snap fold, so it has to be like some ace-4 or something. Anyways, another way that we can look at hands, right, as something we take the hand and learn from it. I'll quickly run it for you guys. High-jack open raises, I'll open it in a second on the right screen. So I just want to copy the board correctly. So I need to check six and five of spades. Check and the half pot, call, ten of diamonds, king of spades. Check. All right, so let's have a look at our jack ten. and And this makes me very happy that it's a freaking 100% check. And even winning a lot of PV, right? I mean, it's like a third of a big blind better than betting 60%. Just because villain either has nothing or he has that king in both betting. A reasonable range that bets, like, the sizing I think makes sense. it's just not it's like like not even close to be raising right it's like losing lots of pvp that race because villain is just too strong like has so many two pairs and it's still the hijack right the hijack that yeah and one thing is 43 i mean i used I think. Queen nine, ace queen. I mean, we're definitely not seeing those aces all in re-raises. So that obviously helps. So it's not that bad. Like I consciously reckon that. But just again, it's about presenting another way of looking at a hand. We have a hand. I have a clear question, the river and and i want to think about my entire range right so jack 10 look alike we take king jack that can block bet like any king or just polarize also works right big size that that works but yeah we do not lots of betting and have a variety of different sizes in a way not that much it's like we are very very very handcuffed here on on that king river all right so that's it pretty much a very very light one today with hands i hope you still enjoyed it a couple of people that have been here danzu thanks for the hands especially for me. Always like this is, I think this is actually not for beginners. This is like really for people who work a lot with hands and want to get better because it's like lots of things of like awareness, thinking about the right ideas, talking in the right way to people to get the right answers and so on. So really the key takeaways here today are just to be aware of your exact questions right have the exact questions whenever you ask someone for advice for hand history just make sure you have a question like not did i play good that's okay right it's like but then expect the yes or no answer and yeah choose your way of analyzing consciously right when you review your spots yourself it's like not every session review has to be the same right you can look at certain spots focus on something focus on bed sizes focus on just the quick relief and so on and try to put an answer into works right when you think things through yourself it helps so much to really speak it out loud to write it down or at least do it in your brain because then it really sticks to it and it forces you to ask that question in the end to have words for something you need to think about a certain question and this is the main point today all right thanks for thanking us yeah very good session thank you nice time i learned something like all this hey stephanie is amazing to see you alive i'm watching your videos of cash hope to see you in person someday yeah why not i mean i'm here in vienna most of the time as always post hands in discord i'm around actually not traveling the next two months i will be a little more active feel free to put stuff there any further questions i should definitely join them now i think that's the best idea wish you the best afternoon and have fun everyone who watches Chambers League tonight and all the others see you in discord and maybe even at the tables I might play some for fun have a great one bye bye guys
