### TOPIC: cash hand review 17
 All right guys, as I said in the intro, I have a special plan for you. So actually I will jump today in some very, very tough games. I hope that I get a three-handed game running. Again, not with the goal of making money, but to double check on our game. Yeah, around Christmas time, here it comes to an end. So why not double check on our game? I wasn't playing too much this year, not this summer. And actually I didn't really caught the fire. I was busy in private life. So i'm let's say for a 300 game like that i can consider myself a very rusty but this is still how we can use something like that to figure out the spots we suck in do some good reviews and get better improve to then crush in the games that we really select to make money this guy has really good heads up and i'm really not a heads up player yeah i mean why not let's let's try and learn some heads up as well let's just record that maybe some interesting stuff happening that we can look up later it's like playing gto out here this is someone else the bias joining here it's another good player joining there and yeah i'll try to not make many mistakes to not let them exploit me i know that those guys won't do many mistakes. And just guide you guys through. Queen four off, easy fold. All right, so I open raise. This is an okay check. All right, nice check down. I think with the six of clubs, it's a better c-bet as well. Solid mix like that, trying to get to showdown. Now it's really, really, really, really, really, really close whether we can find a thin value bet againstHigh, against Deuce-X. The question is how many 9-X is he checking? I think it's not a clear bet, so I'll go for the check. Decide if he bets we have a pure bluff catcher, but I probably won't fold, even though I'm blocking lots of bluffs. Maybe the very tiny bet is better, but just check, check. I should just always win, and that's fine. All right, so let's play that. Raise only in the small blind here. here play those boards and here i'm going for a mixed trade-off board i'm going to check here play lots of check raises and now this here another four is interesting i'm not sure about my sizing plan here i think just something normal betting twice seems very very reasonable he obviously can have some quite some forex i have them myself. I have clear value with that hand. Get a fold. So yeah, goals for me to spot things I struggle with regarding sizings, regarding frequencies, obviously to spot mistakes that I will end up doing. To then play some drills, dig a little deeper. Where's the problems? Where are they coming from? Queen 10, I think with those backdoors against third pot, we got a call. Obviously would be favorable to have the queen of hearts. Now what am I folding? I think this is a solid check back. And yeah, actually we can bring that to showdown on a brick river like that. And yeah, no need to bluff. I have way more stuff that I need to bluff. And he has a same hand. That's fair enough. This year i can flat or three bet i'll put that in the flatting range for now i'll mix a little not play three bet only take a little closer the solver that makes life easy five four suited definitely open raising and definitely calling versus a three bet just thinking about how close that is against big blind three bet i mean i'm calling we're not thrilled about it against tighter ranges we prefer four five suited here to run into all his king five suited ten seven suited type of things is not that cool and against half pot i think against small bet we have to continue against half but it should still be close but has to be a fold getting another walk in here king loose off will be a fold person three four off is a clear fold nine suited all right so another big three bet again those are not high ev defense against two tight players we can easily let them go sometimes obviously defending when i make a video like that not even close then really i try to have the image of like have an idea of the absolute number in my head like how clear is that defend instead of just go with feeling yeah i mean have a clear call here raising is obviously somewhat fine because we have an absolute monster but call should be favorable i can see some turn gems to be honest but rather yeah this might be interesting i'm not sure what are my gems here probably some eight acts without flush draw pocket nine something like that i think it's just call down now it's a pretty easy call down to be honest with a rivered flush obviously not winning 100 of the time but we are super happy about it hopefully stacking someone here for 1k usd ace jack here we go so right now we have like a first spot like this is exactly what i'm looking for i think we even have that lately in discord depending on when you watch that video that we talked about those turn jams three bad pot in position it's usually those when he has lots of high cards that have six outs against us when we don't have the flush draw or he has an over pair yeah that we run into but the river won't give us any information either ace deuce is actually a fold against good players and then we have those protection jams with like hands that need to stack off but don't gain any information from seeing another river like in that spot here 10 8 deuce 10 my first instinct would have been pocket 9s maybe pocket Jacks as well if they don't decide to raise flop here we can do both well we can bet a lot on that board we can actually use a bigger size as well I'll go with that small size which has to be fine with the gutshot and thinking a gutshot is obviously very nice doesn't really make that much sense to size up here i play 75 only it's a little unfair that duty takes this small sizing so king six definitely is a defend here this might against this sizing even be a defend but he plays three bet only so it's like he has like pocket fives in there 100 so i'll let this one go gco wizard uses 12 and i think king six is a call there for the suited kings and like king nine suited and King 8, King 7 is close as are King 5, King 4. So he makes it two big blinds cheaper that should be better for a hand like a suited King but his range is different if he plays three bet only. So I'm not sure how that interacts with my plan. So I try to stick closer to GTO Wizard sizing so that everything I look up is a little more clear. So I go with four pocket jacks and the 12th big blind, three bet. Walking 10 offsuit is a pretty clear fold. So three use offsuit. Somehow I don't get into blind versus blind spots against bad pot Corey. Like he was open seating, I joined. So I actually mixed up positions where I joined. To have two different spots against the same player always makes it more interesting. It was a coincidence that Judy and Psycho Aggramore joined exactly the same time. Queen on off will be a clear defend, but not really a three bet. I still randomize if it's like super, super, super low. I double check my brain whether I can find a little something here. We have two overs with the fake backdoors against a small sizing, I think. I need to implement a small check raising range and this has to go in there sometimes 21 is enough low number get the snap fold is fine so if backdoor straight two overs plus the fake suit so we unblock his non-backdoor right i forgot which suit was not on the board but this is the one he's he's probably bad folding the most instead of chasing will be not a high frequency his small c-bet won't be that much of a thing in gto wizard he uses lots i know that i studied a lot with him there's lots of simplifications and then has a very very very clean and beautiful turn river game tree where he's just not making any mistakes and he's like giving up is the wrong word but kind of giving up slightly for that yep clear defense pocket sevens let's play three bad pot out of position against him not flop the set unfortunately Well ace six suited against the big blind three bet I think we can do both especially deep to take ace six suited into a four betting range 15 big blinds is fine But actually I'll let it go against a small size We have a must defend with pocket sevens and yeah check turn obviously ace ten is a clear call Obviously it's a very clear call as well third pot i mean we're not going anywhere this year is probably a block bet i feel like i always have the best hand to be honest he has a better ace oh king queen wow interesting king queen seems very very close on the turn to be honest this has to be a mistake it just has to be a block bet somehow i feel like i have more value than that on an exploitative side just like i don't know can't explain the feeling a little scared of facing some jams okay three seven spades is not an open race that king queen is like something okay i'll be interested in that right my hand in position i didn't even have a raising option there so yeah against those sizings i had the clearest call of all times the river was the clearest check back i know i played that hand perfectly in the wizard sense but like still seeing that that king seeing something unexpected from him makes my brain think right in a double checking session like that finding spots that i'm unsure about being interested in what others are doing has to be the key as this pocket sevens how am i splitting my sizing there i might have a nine i might have obviously the trips i might have lower pocket seven sixes fives then it starts being a 4x this one i'm actually i can bet a lot actually so keep the game tree simple checking is also fine super tiny check raise very good move by him i have the clearest call of all times yeah go from there that's just beautiful turn card and now i think this is one of the 9x i want to check back because he needs to almost check range like just a lot now and i don't want to bet all my 9x i think and the jack seems to be a good one just because it needs less protection he might have lots of jack x in his range so 9 7 is more of a bet here or i go for a small and then another street both seems fine i'll check it this time already expecting like three times pot or the check jam and this here might just be a call it seems super nitty but i don't know what i should achieve with a race here just call be a knit quads here we go always good to be a little paranoid and here we go for this an eight nine idiot open under a kind of the jack not really beautiful out so i'm not check raising this one here often pretty much never actually let's just call with nine of hearts is a very bad check raise here we go with the jack let's see his sizing choice definitely still have some check raises here it's not like he has ace king all the time he has lots of other stuff as well and this now i'm unblocking all potential two pairs so i think my hand needs to bet is it strong enough to bet this amount or is it just a block bet i'm really unsure kind of king 10 king jack it has to be good enough for this unsure river sizing very tough in that spot ace three with that rake structure probably a very close call i know it's a mix in gto wizard against a very very good player i'll just let it go here right side i decreased my sizing because i need to play a more mixy range because we are deeper so i cannot stack off all the over peers anyways spr is too big so i don't want to raise too big with my like aces kings and so on and this this defines my sizing 10-6 suited actually should be close 10-7 suited is probably defend or some four batting 10-6 suited should be close and yeah I guess he's the better player these days so I'm happy to let a little little something go king five deuce clear trade off board I rolled check this time both check call and check raise seem valid options against half pot i slightly prefer the check call eight deuce two options also and i'll go for the iso check this board back you should use lots of large bets here if he's betting check back or a large bet i'm not expecting many half pots stuff right pot size i'm still beating value you can do that with king jack king 10 so with the clearest call of all times probably river call most cards as well but then a rather unhappy one and this here it's like real shit check we win that's good and what did he have seven six okay seven six give up here i'm really really really unsure that seems so weak to check that back i need to bluff yeah snap call 10 jack i don't know how many non-two pairs he's having like a queen x 10x he doesn't have too many of those the nine and ace obviously makes a straight yeah maybe just to check back with that eight don't know i have lots of shit that i iso so i have lots of check check without equity tough one ace of hearts king better use a half pot sizing on that board here i can call or race both is fine let's go for the race this is actually a fold and six five three against this sizing has to be a call so good luck us this is a good one i think we should mainly race here i'm not sure some boards are just like more gems this here mint check race and then call off seems tough call seems somewhat fine. I think it's a min check raise call off. Fits better in my range, but I'm really, really unsure. Not building too much of a calling range on that board. It's weird that he sizes that big, to be honest. This is interesting. Min click. Now my hand has to be call. I'm calling my nuts and I'm check raising a king as well. Not just jamming and now I cannot check fold so it has to go in the middle But it's always the freaking flush draw. Yeah, I mean it's in good luck us. This is a wild hand Queens Yeah, like his little little size up seemed so like that hand I'd like this is people are playing like GTO gods This was like a manual sizing no hotkey and it's exactly the one hand that wants to get the max money in against jacks tens nines now so it's like it's really really wild that like i mean i can't do anything with my hand so i'm i'm absolutely fine i'm more interested in the in the theory how to play that pot but he was not playing theory here he clicked something just looking at his hand and i'm like 100 sure of that so this was very very very wild. But yeah, what we are here for it It's very cool to spot stuff like that when some of the best players here are playing right? So just again on the like especially the left table We gotta understand that this is tougher than pretty much any I have it open right now any of the 5k GG tables that are Running right now. So yeah, super super cool to have that spot easy call with king 10 obviously the pot not equity clear show on value now nowhere that we are bluffing here if we have a club we can turn that like into a bluff and have options try to get to showdown and yeah that's fine queen seven hopefully first in nope all right three four again a mix this time checking back knock my board keep it running another 10 minutes more or less and then we have quite something to review not a long session but still so many spots all right another ace king this is 100 iso and this is my sizing call alrighty so ace king obviously both options on that board 21 is more on the betting side i'll use a half pot board i. I'm really not sure. I'm not playing Limp myself, so I gotta, yeah, freestyle a little here regarding sizing. So I keep one sizing, and then if I only choose one, it's probably around that half pot. Obviously you can have a smaller and a bigger one as well, but nothing is really wrong on a board texture like that. Sevens, all right. Three bets, so happy about the sizing when having pocket pair like this. Important to understand that compared to gto wizard we have a higher spr that means the way directional in is longer we don't need to call down as aggressively with like yeah hands like that when they don't hit i'm going to call my king eight of hearts here i mean i will definitely call a small bat third pot backdoor straight two nut outs more or less let's call the nine is a very good card for me obviously he has all the nine x as well he's range betting this board so i need him to have like some some ace eight some pocket sixes some ace five that are just checking now or giving up i won't end up winning against his king jack and so on so i'm checking back for sure here there's not really a reason to bet this i hope and this really really really sucks this is a board that we can easily over bluff insanely this year i play like every queen i'm checking most queens on the turn again so i go for an overbet bluff here and this year he has all the ace highs in the world i have like five x sixes sevens eights all the same my seven is not really anything I think it's just a give up. And it's very easy to over bluff that. 98 is even the clear give up. White flag. Yeah, this is exactly what we looked for on the turn. I mean, he's probably folding that ace high if I bet like a reasonable size. Cool. This is like, I always enjoyed that and still do. This is like kind of like having colleagues, right? I wrote him even before that i'm recording and just like half an hour and he just stays around to make it happen 986 again half pot is fine any other size i mix it a little and this time i roll the check back so let's do that overbet after checking i don't love it too much it's obviously fine it's not a huge overbet splitting his range so he wraps a nine or like ace eight plus maybe right now i mean i'm calling and now i have a clear fold but like if he has a nine he's he's in trouble on so many rivers here like that what's he doing like he can block bet a nine now and hate when he gets raised obviously when he bets something like this every 10 like i think it's very tough for him to find bluffs and i just find a rather easy fold i think i hope booked eights again here against Mr. Ace-8 suited. This here is check or a big bet in theory you can use a small bet as well i'll check this one call pocket eights again kind of a same board like that we have the backdoor flush backdoor straight yeah even though everything regarding i need a nine for a backdoor straight that's not too interesting now eight five i think this one i can bet still easy call and yeah now on the turn if he bets big we are indifferent check eight is close let it go ah it has to be like a full probably just a nine out is too bad eight out not good ten four is probably close in the sim ten seven suited i'll go for a check back but flopping flush is obviously nice glad that he can only bet half pot because against half but i have a fold against like a third quarter pot my hand is i think still afloat but you can't do that so here i'll check call my flush no reason to fast play anything here keep the range together easy check call wait for the river three bad we'll put in some four bets and some folds i won't be calling too much 98 is actually a fold 13.8 we can't value raise against that so we have a snap call ace eight it's a clear call all righty here we go ace of spades somewhat cool to have could stab we could check both is valid on the right side we can bet we can check i'll actually bet this time and check the left side check Check the turn on the right side. Again, betting is not wrong. Ace, ace, and now we're going check down mode. Might be thin to even like protection bet that, but I think it's too thin. Check calling this one. And having easy decision on the river. This here is an easy decision as well. We call him off. He rivers a four, fair enough. Check, all right, so. Seven, nine, we sucked out on his two pair, but I think we played it fine. Just double checking on the left table in 2K. Who played the first big blind? To end in a fair way. Five, eight is a fold. And ace, twos is a fold again. And another three bet. Let's donate another one to duty. I think I'm not folding this one. Against 10 has to be a call. I mean, solver will show 12 big blinds and a fold probably here we go let's go my friend hands like that i mean raising there is not really a point we have perfect information on the turn we hit something or turn driver we hit something not it or nothing at all so yeah this is the absolute worst card in the deck because our nine sucks he makes infinite nuts i wonder whether there is a card where it's a turn fold check wow what is he checking here still perfect information i wait for a river card pretty certainly i don't want to bluff this one do i get a king x note that my nine is nicer out no this is an interesting card he can have a 10 as well obviously do i have give have give ups here? Does it get worse than that? Ace of clubs is the better give up. I need to bluff that. Just thinking about what I am jamming, not this hand. All right, let's finish this session and see you later for the first review.
