### TOPIC: cash hand review 18
 All right, everyone. So finally, I'm back for the review of the little three-handed session. I played two tables, NL1K and NL2K, actually against some of the best in the world. But yeah, we played like half an hour, 35 minutes of three-handed two tables against some very, very good players. And the goal was just to see where we are at, right? To figure out where are the problems, what can we learn, right? It was something I like doing, especially around Christmas time and so so on like really getting ready for the next year again yeah let's see what we find so the goal of that little session here is to find topics we can then deeper work at where just like i felt like i struggled a little where maybe we just made some mistakes for that we just follow the little quick fix from like the little gto wizard series i did. If you haven't had a look into that one, I highly recommend that. How to use GTO Wizard perfectly. I uploaded all the hands here and we can first of all see I played overall. This is the top one, 131 hands with like 14 mistakes. We'll get to that later. It definitely weren't 14 mistakes with an average EV loss of minus 0.02 which is absolutely fine but actually it is way less than that if we take a deeper look because GTO Wizard is limited to certain parameters and if we played out of those parameters then actually it messes up and we can look at the one big mistake here there was the little four-bet pot we played I looked that up already in Pio so what happened here button open raises i three bet the big blind i use the gto wizard sizes to 13. he uses a small four bat and i think exactly that size and i have a rather clear call against a good player flop is check he continues quarter pot i mean check raise so here in gto wizard we have a problem that min check raising is not an option i can tell you if you put it into pie with real ranges and you offer the min check raise then this is absolutely a thing right my hand is a mix like call still fine but definitely same ev and this here is like pretty much like check jamming just investing too much that costs all the ev compared to check calling and then we see that villain actually clicked back which is a mistake by him giving me one more option yeah so the the click back is actually a mistake and he should just jam he had pocket queens so he min clicked it back i have an easy call against that there it's important to not just freaking rip it in to give yourself the option for the turn and then the turn was the three of spades so i called we are not all in here and then i donk jam my 15 outers i think it's still better to just check and then call off six high because it fits better for my range i was fine with the donk jam as well if he has like an ace jack ace 10 some bluff once in a lifetime it's fine but he should check them back on the turn often as well and then i can just love the river or just get my free card with 15 outs so that's fine here we just ran it good ev and then the money goes in the middle and i lose so this is the 1.41 that actually are just a mistake in gto wizard but not in the real world so here we have the first one that is interesting queen 10 offsuit i call big blind versus small blind i float here on the flop against a third pot i said like it might be close the queen of hearts would clearly be better and that gives me a very good feeling right if this is the zero ev hand and i call it in game that this is very close the queen of hearts will make it 100 call and then on the turn check check is fine you can play it like a seven sometimes that will be fine on the river i missed a mandatory bluff i thought i have more stuff like that like a jack 10 10 8 5 6 all of that that busted that i cannot bluff that queen high but apparently yeah villain just needs to bet stronger stuff himself and i can move him off some queen jack queen 10 probably maybe some low pierce i should be better off or just the same hand as we've seen here so now first thing that is a slight mess up and I'll write it down for later for the next videos is blind versus blind river bluffing after floating right or let's just call it turn river bluffing turn river bluffing after floating very interesting where to put those hands in there what not and so on and so a slight mistake you or actually the biggest one like a fifth of the big blind that's something mistake we shouldn't do too often then we got this year i remember that hand because it was against my friend tobias dudweiler he open raises the button i defend standard defense sometimes a three bet yet check that flop and actually gets a small bet that he used it's just a fold but i kind of overruled that i mean it's it's easy to just throw that hand away but i i even said like he's the type of guy who simplifies a lot to range betting and this is a board that he cannot or shouldn't be range betting let's have a quick look don't want to find a justification for like a small misplay right i went for the queen let's have a look at his strategy first he's probably not using the big sizes very often that allows him to bet more often but not like 100 definitely not and i went for the small size which is the correct size here on that board to just target his stuff but i took this hand which is like just not the best hand so i would be fine if i if i had like jack 10 or jack 9 and it looks like this in the in the sim here right 10 9 the two over cards just over the top here are like better straight connectivity usually are the ones you want to go with and my queen i was really a stretch so i would be fine if it looked like jack 10 jack 9 and then i think i did the right exploit or just like not exploit just adjusting to his strategy and his strategy is also valid right even though it's not the gto wizard one But yeah that was a little too wide i would just say eight nine of hearts three bad pot check raising low boards let's write that down as the second one right check raising low boards big blind versus button check raising low boards small sizing all right so then the next one is another one we talked about where I wanna stack, I open raise a button, big blind uses GTA Wizard sizing, raises to 13, and I call my nine eight of hearts. And I said even it should be like zero EV, it's close, but we're looking for the close spots when I'm recording. So it's fine just to fold would've been good as well. We have a clear flop call against half pot, and on the turn against another half pot, we actually have a clear jam. And I was thinking about on that 10, what are the jams? I was more into the pocket nines pocket jacks direction but actually like it's not like villain is betting too many eight acts with like half pot half pot that i have that benefit against and it's exactly this type of hands that wants to do that like a nine is not great an eight obviously is good we have the flush draws but villain can have strongerain can have stronger flush draws. So yeah, here we are calling with good equity. This here is the good stuff that is happening, but he had five outs, right? Five outs. So that's not necessarily perfect and denying that would be also good while getting caught by some nut flush draws. Let's just have a quick look here. So Villain's half pot should be a cool size on that board. Third or like half pot is the main sizing. I think you can simplify those together and only play half pot. He did that with ace, jack with a heart. Turn, he keeps going. I think it wasn't the jack of hearts, which should be fine. What was his exact hand? I think the ace suit matters as well. Spades. Ah, it's not that great. Not blocking the ace 10. So it's ace of spades, jack of hearts. Not the perfect one, but still fine. Just just a heart is good especially the jack of hearts there this should be our raising range right just a little little 10x some random hearts pocket queens without hearts a little and i think those are the blockers to the 10x 9 8 and 8 7 so are the 100 percenters together with an ace 8 without the suit right just like seeing more cards even an ace is not a good card to see this is the one that just best option is is jamming we see some like fractions of pocket fours so i think it's a five percent range and it's like almost no ev gain i think it's okay actually to just play call only in that spot i just want to look how would it be if it was not a paired board it's like a brick then it would be more the pocket 10x and pocket jacks probably 26.5 pocket jacks to get in against 10 not that often actually it's more than 10 9 like denying equity from over cards a king 10 king 6 of hearts something like that yeah that's more of the pattern i was thinking about actually an ace queen of hearts is interesting i don't get that point is there so much ace king bet folding or is there any weaker ace x calling there's like quite some ace king betting and then probably mix bet folding yeah so that's the reason for the ace queen of hearts but yeah let's write that down button versus small blind big blind raising turn versus double barrel all right just another topic i was not 100 sure in game maybe made a small mistake or if I'm consciously know like okay, this would be raising hand, but I play call only That would be a different thing Alright, this hand was just heads up where I went a little too thin for value But I'm fine with that against that opponent another play we had here Defend big blind versus button actually 8-9 offsuit seems to be close like no way I'm falling. Check call Sometimes check raise raise here on queen 10-7. Turn is straight but not great so it goes check check and the rubber ace makes it even worse so every king makes a straight and I thought about okay I'm unblocking all the two pairs that I want to get value from. I definitely want to bet. Checking seems actually also fine and the bet should be slightly bigger but here finding that bet and if gto wizard tells me it should be slightly bigger I'm fine with that right that's not i don't consider that a real mistake then something like that the very last hand eight six suited it says minus 0.06 creflop but this is the case if villain raised to 12 that was against duty and he actually raised to 10 only so this is just so much of a better price this has to be a clear defend so this does not exist here but we can overrule that interesting how to play charles rivers but we cannot look it up here all right here it's a spot where the gto sizing would be 12 but villain actually made it 13 and then i decided to fold instead of calling that's like very close i think that's fine right he made it bigger than that so my calling ev will be slightly lower for the worst price so that's not a mistake this year jack three suited i play race only it's like just a borderline hand if it limps quite often so i'm fine actually folding that first in in the small blind didn't know the exact border that's fine this year is incredibly cool i've seen that already and this is the following villain open raises small blind i call in the big blind with queen four suited. I start stabbing the turn half pot, which is fine. The flop and the turn on a jack, I kept betting like normal size and I should do this here, like either check, because my hand hates to get check raised, or I should do 250% pot. So I didn't look that up so far how the range plays or whether that is just that hand, but a double flush draw spot. I think I'm attacking king high flush draws already here to just fold them out. But yeah, I mean, it's all kind of same EV. It's a very, very fancy play. And we are like this solver takes 150. We are like 160 big blind steep. So it's not 100. Definitely want to look things up 100 big blind steep as well. Just to know my baseline strategy. So here on double flush draw turn i'm unsure and so i'm fine with that but we have three sizes like i think i put those two together and play that as like 75 only bet less of that 7x maybe 7 8 and take a bigger size for that and we also have that 30 now like the queen high flush draws seem to go mainly into that let's have a look why that is the case if we bet 30 i think villain starts maybe folding nut flush draws he said no not at all okay so it has to be the king high flush draws that we fold out and against this sizing all the king high flush draws are calling so we have a clear cool effect for our queen four of spades and we play only then against the jack x of spades the seven x of spades and okay the nut flush draws something that is fine and now let's have a look whether that exists also this is the big sizing we can use 150 big blinds deep to really push them out for 100 big blinds only still like it's adjusted sizing like of 150 then only and queen four will mainly go into this one but the 77 would be also fine so interesting right don't forget that going directional in in position they are on double flush to abort you have all the two pairs in the world so you can put some pressure on that make villains suffer with those big bets yeah let's write it down as big line versus small band barreling plan versus block check especially those sizings so let's see some more mistakes limp pot where i should check back 100 i think all those shitty hands are like some frequency in the race okay non-existent i'm not too much in the blind versus blind limping game without anti so i don't really care here button raises and i called the small line with king eight suited and took the wrong sizing here on that river i thought i can bet every queen like that seems like my hand is just not good and i need something going for me like it's all same ev so i'm actually fine with that it just feels like it gets through all the time and that is king i i saw a limper i should raise a little bigger i mean i take one size only i take 3.5 here so i'm fine with that and for me it's not a mandatory check sometimes betting and i only use this size so it's okay in my eyes not a real mistake that's for the very very quick fix seeing some mistakes seeing what was the mistake maybe what is something i can look deeper into scrolling out that five six suited because this is just a mess up by gto wizard and then we have some spots that i wrote down let's take a deeper look at not only the mistakes but also the big pots and we'll find them in gto wizard let's start on the button we want this stack with nine eight of hearts a rivering a flush and then we had three bad pots all against duty three bats i have a clear call he has a c-bat i think he range bats that board let's make it big and we have a turn spot all right so let's look that up here played it fine let's have a look at that turn how often we should stab talked about turn here we have a clear call on the flop i mean not that clear like zero ev already and on the turn with a very very clear check that's what i thought as well we beat ace highs that give up we beat five x and he also has pocket sixes and on the river which is a queen we actually have 100 give up because everything else would be an absolute like over bluff right so let's have a look what are our bluffs here we need to bluff something that unblocks his folds and we just blocked like two combinations of a7 suited pocket sevens he might just give up i don't know where they should always bluff let's first have a look is villain always bluffing his sevens yes he is so this seven doesn't matter we block king seven a7 which are probably check folds check and our bluffs are probably the lower shit deuces threes the weakest pocket six is here and that's about it right jack high checking we just cannot we don't have many value bets and we have those few bluffs so we got to go with them and take a rather big sizing and then villain has like folds here and call some of those ace highs. And actually check jams king eight of hearts. That's freaking strong. Okay, cool. All right, so rather fine play here. Let's get to the next hand. Eight six of clubs. I mean, here we shouldn't have that in the GTO wizard sim. But because of that smaller sizing, we should have it. Just see what can we do about it that we can simulate that in a way i think we can't this is just such a special 12 alter like seven eight of clubs would be very very different but let's still try right let's have a look six eight of clubs to learn from it right so let's say we have seven eight of clubs and change the board slightly to get more or less the same effect we We make it queen, ten, six then. Queen of clubs, ten of clubs and six of hearts. And just imagine we have seven, eight of clubs, which absolutely is in our calling range. Face a small flop bet and then we should do this on the button. Seven, eight of clubs. I even talked about it. We know exactly where we are at on the turn. So we clearly call here instead of raising. Turn turn villain actually i know a device had ace queen and the combo he had is actually a high frequency over bad jam for two times pot which is pretty cool on that board right just imagine you have king queen you have king jack you have 10 9 you have jack 9 you have the flush nut flush draws and so on how much it hurts the button but yeah he checked to us which is not really a play with ace queen and our eight seven of clubs is just the clearest check back of all times just nothing good happening if we were betting here and on that river 10 he went for the block bet with ace queen which then is obviously fine i think he went a little too big it's like 10 he went 30 and obviously we should not do anything with our seven eight of clubs just thinking about raising like not the right one we need some some cool blockers something going on like a queen nine maybe can jam that's pretty much about it like some ace jack with the right suits yeah we need something going for us so it's just another we lost all the three that pots but that's what it is pocket eights i think this is a rather clear one here here three bets another small c-bet let's have a look so on the flop actually with the backdoor flush draw maybe this is something i can implement in my game to just let those pockets go a little earlier the sevens were like sometimes a four those pocket eights even with the backdoor flush draw sometimes a fold just fold that and don't get into turn trouble i face a turn bet and i think i have a rather clear fold like here it's like still some frequency but it says minus zero points seven four so this is some gto wizard problem here and yeah let's still have a look. So pocket 8 on the flop without diamonds will be an easy fold. Double check on that He went not 33 but 25 So it's a little more clear that we call with diamonds and fold without and then on the turn he had King Jack actually He rolled his randomizer and he had one without the diamonds one of the ones that do not want to see that that often but he went for it and yeah because of his smaller sizing then he had a bigger turn size just kind of same game tree and our pocket eights are just i even talked about how bad it is he had king jack like if we hit a nine it's not not to the nuts rather clear fold i would say yeah just nothing we could do cool race call fold four five suited i mean not that interesting that it for interesting hands. Let's go to the small blind. Do we have any three bad pot spots? Not really. Blind versus blind. All those hands were fine. They were not in our mistake list. So here, not really something to look up too much. Big blind. The six, five suited, kind of a special one. But yeah, it's fine. And this here is the 10, four of spades. Let's have a look at this one. Philon has two goes for min bet on this mono board which is a good sizing and then sizes up and has a river like hotkey 75 sizing or something like that and now let's quickly look at our 10-4 of spades how we should play that one mistake that lots of people are doing is just a flush fast play and then be in trouble later and get all the coolers against them here we see like okay we check we could sometimes donk okay we have a clear check call sometimes check raise and if we are check raising small check another rather clear check call if we are raising again just a small raise and small donk on the river can be a thing and then it's just a check call right any race is just losing ev it's okay but we're not getting called by enough worse stuff so just flushes mean slow play mainly cool hand big line versus button this one i messed up isoing but i'm not too much into limp pots there so yeah this year i want to look up this was very very weird build open raises i call third pot bet i call third pot bet i call i think this has to be for value but he's just like folding out my weaker king highs now and get called by all ace highs. And then check, check. I want to know how good or bad his king queen of spades bet is. So let's have a look at here, this winning hand. I have a clear flop call. I could sometimes raise. Very clear turn call. Very clear river check back. So let's have a look about villain's third pot bet here on the turn very very interesting for me i'm not really executing that and here's actually king queen wrong suit but it's not far off right it's it's like okay to do it some king queens do it some offsuits right different suits just blocking some of the three x is probably important this is why it's diamond starts to kill like the raising range a little and i probably should continue with like king jack king 10 100 this is where the value comes from i should fold some a7 a6 so like kind of mergey play realizing equity and i yeah i don't have that in my game so i like to see it now that it's actually fine important to find those raises here also as bluffs also thin value with an eight some queen tens king tens to mess up plan. If I call king ten here every time and ever raise it, he gets some additional value and actually makes money with his play here. So nice play by him. Not sure whether I reacted correctly. Like my ace ten is just a no brainer. So I did not really think about my reaction here in detail, but yeah, very, very cool one to see. All right, this queen four, we had that. Check raise was a little too light nine eight was fine and i think this was it right so just 131 spots we found a little list of things that we are interested in right blind versus blind turn river bluffing after we float big man versus button check raising low boards button versus small man big man raising turn versus double barrel or like continuation versus double barrels maybe better button versus line raising continuation versus double barrel or like continuation versus double barrels maybe better but we're small raising continuation versus double barrel or bluffing after floating kind of the same thing right the turn with lots of spots where we had a mediocre hand had like a zero EV call like the seven of the pocket eights and then I mean I was pretty sure on the turn what you do it would be lying if I said like didn't know but still this is a spot we can look into and then the big blind versus small blind barreling plan so what i want to do next is this was like kind of the quick fix maybe a little extended quick fix to find out mistakes i hope you like that from that just that little session playing versus very very good players and now we can train right train exactly those spots right so i will make like two drills I think. One is button versus small blind, big blind, 3-bet pot as caller and see what's coming up there. A little more of those spots and just the blind versus blind as big blind. Just a little float and then maybe bluff or start barreling and so on. This is the plan for the next videos. See you there!
