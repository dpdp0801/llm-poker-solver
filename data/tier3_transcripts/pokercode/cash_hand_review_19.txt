### TOPIC: cash hand review 19
 All right here I'm back again after that little three-handed session and the review to it the let's say a little extended quick fix double checking the mistakes but scrolling through the hands as well to find those spots that we want to dig a little deeper in and train a little. So here we are training now and we have two spots in our mind right because of just one thing I messed up and the other one I was unsure. I refer to the queen 10 hand on ace 977 deuce that I didn't turn into a bluff on the river. And we've seen gto wizard I lost like fifth of a big blind which is too much in that spot and I shouldn't miss that yeah pretty clear that I should bluff that in the end and I didn't so yeah I want to take a deeper look at those floats and then bluffing a little later sizing and hand selection and understand that a little deeper here with the immediate feedback and the other spot is when villain checks to me what is my betting strategy right so we had that queen four of spades that wanted to go for a crazy over bet on the turn and i didn't have that in my arsenal really i went for a normal size bet that did not really exist with my hand it was fine range wise that this sizing exists that's always important to me to not take something totally out of the box yeah so i opened two tables here it will be sing race pots only as the big blind versus the small blind and we focus on those two things calling and then go crazy a little and making a betting plan against a check so on the left side is already very very interesting ace three of spades with a backdoor flush draw on the board that is not good for us it's an easy continuation against the third pot bet i think against half but we still need to continue i think a race is an option as well i'm not doing that because that would not put me in that spot or if a race is fine a call is also fine i will call this one and then go to the turn that three is interesting but i think i have to take it to showdown like sizing would be a very big sizing here that's a great great card for villain. And he can do quite some overbets. If he checks, he is mainly like a weak queen, a 10, a 4. So I can take my strong queen X and actually overbet that. A 3X here just seems a little too strong. I don't want to fold out his ace highs with my potential cooler for a two pair. So I'm checking this one. And I'm not playing that as in love. And I will check that back easily on hope for the best and see like okay it's 100% check and on the flop not really raised just a call and here even seeing that reaction on that ace high this is why I don't want a bad turn all right ace five with one spade he checks to us and jack jack nine because gto wizard is sometimes slow I already click next hand here but I will focus on the right side and yeah ace high is obviously good check back always we could think about stabbing this here sometimes because we have spades and we want to stab some ace highs as well we start with the lowest ones usually so i'm checking this one it can't be 100 bad and i'll check back once more and yeah not really put that into a betting plan until the river and even here it should be close small that position just does not exist so we have to take this here if we are betting. But I'm not that thrilled about it. And we see that river. Okay, bet two. I'm not playing that. It's just in some, some, some instances. This is because all the ace-axe split here. I'm like ruling out every bet less than 50% on the river because it doesn't really exist in most spots. All right, let's get to the left side. We have an idiot gutshot with a backdoor flush draw. We clearly have a call and we will turn that to bluff at some point for sure. Or just fold if villain bets, obviously. This has to be a fold. Flop. It's a good raise sometimes. That makes sense. Villain will re-raise his jack 10. So we get that in a way out of the way that our seven gets more clean and just good stuff happening. Like instead of just calling and hoping for that that makes sense i like it and on the right side check check seems fine if we are betting we're using a small size on one of boards and both will be fine small size or check so that fits all right on the left side eight five deuce he checks to us quite frequently now the question is we always like i have that idea of that offsuit side in the range like that this way or this way i don't know the offsuit triangle so i have an image in my mind of villain's offsuit hands that he is having that he is check folding but here it could be 10 9 without backdoor it could be jack 9 jack 10 queen 10 queen 9 queen jack king jack even king queen without spades might be a check fold depending on the sizing. And the lower I am in that triangle myself, the more I'm inclined to be betting. Because if I have 9-10, I would be the highest frequency here. It's so important for me to fold out Jack 9, Jack 10, to just like fold out dominating hands. Here Queen 10 is somewhere in the middle. We could bet it, I think. Fold out Queen Jack, maybe King 10 maybe king 10 but it's fine to go check check hit our hand and then actually have the better top pair sometimes right a little domination working around with the little domination effect queen of spades obviously helps for betting a little right unblocks villains folds the heart would also help spades is best hearts second best 10 of clubs is actually like a shithead like this is exactly what i want villain to have that he checks fold so here i'm indifferent could roll a randomizer i could bet i think i'll go for the check for now well let's bet i'm after the betting plan and he raises so that sucks and we see flop three like all those sizings are fine this hand is kind of cool and let's actually use that to showcase what i wanted to explain because i think this is a very very important concept that you need to implement into your game. So now I want to look at villains check folding range and what I mean with that offsuit triangle is this here from king queen king jack where like this is queen is jack is 10 but they are not folding so it's king queen king jack king 10 king 9 queen 9 jack 9 10 9 jack 10 queen 10 queen jack and obviously they could raise sometimes but not many players are like that and here we see those that do not have a spades they are just like high frequency folding and this is what we need to attack. Now we should have an image in our head of villains check folds and then we think about our hands that benefit from that. Here we are check bet. So we have again that triangle here and we start with that 9 like 10, 9 obviously 8 is a And we see king-queen has the lowest frequency of betting. 10-9 has the rather highest. 10-9, jack-9. And this is because of that domination effect, right? We can look a little closer into it. Then having a spade is good. Having a heart is good. Having none of that is shit, right? You see like 10 of diamonds, nine of clubs is not betting that often. And like jack-10, we see it even more clearly and so on, right? just which hands are blocking which hands domination effects that are happening right preparing little top pair coolers on the turn on the river king jack king queen are just very very clear checks even though we might have a spade or so queen ten is just right in the middle this is what i tried to describe the queen of hearts makes it a little better the ten of clubs makes it slightly worse so this is how we can navigate a little all right so that was fine on the right side versus that check it's fine i think to bet it's fine to check we have a king high that's okay we want to fold out stronger king highs so starting with one of the weakest king highs is fine regarding the betting i start with half pot should be fine see here again high frequency but both is fine right so again here let's have a look at this for that little offsuit triangle i talked about because this takes place on every board where there is a check folding range so villain is checking something not betting range and we see again this offsuit hands make frequencies this here is what is important always double check the reaction first he's folding all of that right so we need to think about which hands are benefiting the most actually 10-9 not folding, but like our 10-9 should be again highest frequency bet to fold out jack-9, jack-10, queen-10, queen-9, king-9, king-10, and so on. So let's double check whether that is the case. If you like 10-9 very high frequency, jack-9 high frequency, jack-10, queen-9, queen-10 lower, queen-jack lower, king-9 lower, king-10 almost never, king-jack really never, and king-queen starts being a small value bet. So it's a's a little pattern like that okay so now we've discussed that and we start on the left side again jack 10 the one checks to us on the board that is very good for him i think we use large sizing here to attack like his ace queen and so on not really a small one i think this year is also fine like now having barreling plan this year should be fine this year is I'll go with the overbet. Be a little crazy. And we see that like all those like 20%, 20%. Check is kind of incredible, but makes a lot of sense. It's a board where lots of turns. Jack 10 will not be nutted. And it will be more like a two straight hand, right? Queen, king, ace, nine, and so on. So it makes sense. King, jack with spade has to be a clear continuation. This reminds a lot of our ace, nine, seven, seven board where queen, 10 in the end was a bluff and I didn't go for it. So I'm very, very, very sure that this king, jack here is never betting and not betting river either. So we have a random catcher. His bluffs are worse than king, high. We could call jack of spades. It's actually a K card to call. It won't be 0% call. I'm pretty sure of that. We of that we can roll a dice right it's like i don't have the randomizer here right now do i have it on i have it on right below 30 we call no we fold and it's a hundred percent call so the jack of spades is the card that he's never ever bluffing this is what makes that a good bluff catcher the king is a card he's never bluffing either and we block value like king nine like jack nine like ace like ace jack. So actually it's just a good catcher. And I thought it's more a zero EV catcher, right? Small mistake here regarding bluff catching. Actually not that small. It's kind of like both cards are really, really good. I only thought about like the absolute hand strength. First mistake here, right? We lose our streak, but let's make up for it. Left side, nothing we can do. Right side, easy continuation. Now continuation now betting small seems reasonable checking because we only have one more street betting small again to fall out 10 9 to fall out 10 jack and so on getting called by 5x half plot might be even good small has to be good so i'm betting and now the river is we're not strong enough i would say and we just check it back and the turn right it's like check or small river is just too thin do you see we see tiny fraction of the small bet that i'm not using yeah that should be fine so left side again queen seven a very good board that he checks very good board for him so there might again be some checkbacks even though they seem very unnatural or kind of one of the big sizes i want to go into that barrel plan so i'll go into the big size again be crazy. Get the call. Eight is like good, but not perfect. He might have queen eight and king eight. So I'm not sure whether it's this year. Is this good enough for directional in or slightly bigger? 26 over a bet. Seems close. If we do this year, it's 50 in the middle and we have like 75 left. It's close. I'm not sure. Let's be greedy. And the flop. very good one. Right here it's not one for the check because we are not unblocking. Like the jack-10 before, we were unblocking all the top pair continuations. So here we were blocking all the top pair continuations. Here we unblock the king. That is our main source of value. So we definitely want to go big. And on the turn, let's have a look. It's exactly what I was like. Like this gives you the best best feeling that's like you think about this or this make one decision be greedy both is fine and then we go from there all right cool left side first he checks to us king 10 again offsuit triangle i take weaker king x king of spades i want to have some king of spades in my stabbing range here but not this one i think even though hearts is good but I don't want to fold out his jack-10 of diamonds now. Like, no, why should I? Now should be, again, another check back and then snap call river or a clear value bet. And this, again, seems close on spades, but having spades, it has to be that value bet. This here is something I'm not using, so my options is between those. And again, it's just very, very thin value. Right side. It's a straighty board already, so he checks a little stronger than on something like a jack 10 something. I'm not overbetting that board, even though my hand loves it. I'm using 75% only here. My jack 9 obviously is a high frequency bet. Having a 9 makes it a little tempting to be checking. I'm never bluffing with a 9. So I'm betting more like my jack 6 now. And I want to check back some straights as well. So I think this is a good option. Betting is also fine because we have a straight, so there won't be any mistake with that, but I take that as a check back and now it has to be like a bet fold like that. Maybe even just this on the flush card. He's uncapped. So betting half pot, like for it seems just close. Two pairs are mainly block betting. It's like, let's use this. Let's be always greedy. And the rubber is a little too thin, but we see like no eb loss here all right just when there is a fraction it's not a eb loss i'm like a little little little on the greedy side but that's absolutely fine all right so evaluation of mistakes is really important here king eight here is barrel plan this is something i don't have king six always i think so this is one of my lower kings already king of spades i want to have king of spades in my betting range so i can bet this or this size both is fine i take the small one and i will continue kind of high frequency i would say three is not perfect i wish the king of spades now he would fold lots of king of spades so it's something i could give up i don't have really i mean hitting a king is okay but that's about it it can't be that bad to bet it but check it's like it can't be 100 bad I'm not sure but I'll kind of give this one up and I'll just have an easy fold and the flop again two, three checking like bluffs are additions so it's never really clear but I have my reasoning for like making up a strategy and then on the turn actually low frequency check and it's a high frequency bet. Maybe let's have a look at that as well. Yeah, Willem doesn't have too many 3x that he's check calling. That's true. I don't know whether he even opens ace-3 off. Probably not full frequency. And again, we want to see Villain's reaction. Let's have a look at our offsuit hands. King, king-6, king-7, king-8. King of spades is the one. And the other arm we're giving up. And it's the big size that they want to take. And now we will see why. Because Villain snap folds queen king jack king nine obviously yeah i mean he's like folding king queen with the queen of spades like he has king queen without spades as well after our small sizing that makes a lot of sense so here we have a hand again think about the offsuit triangle that benefits a lot cool was a little chicken here pocket deuces on king queen jack i mean we have better bluffs than this two-outer, I would say. And yes, I'll just check it down. Winning against some ace high is not anymore. Yeah, I kind of hope that he bets. But yeah, it makes it easy. Oh, I cannot full turn. Doesn't make it easy. I have a clear call with pocket deuces. Just because I'm unblocking all bluffs. Interesting. This is now too advanced for me, right? Just like calling because we need to call something that does not have a peer to have bluffs on the river and this unblocks all his like five six bullshit so it's like this has to be better than pocket fives but i'm not going here into detail i think the fold is also fine especially in the real world ace of clubs blocks his check fold so i'm starting some low aces but not the ace of clubs four bring that to showdown while pretty much always losing but it's just one of those hands. That's like here, the ace of clubs just does not want to bet, even though some low aces want to bet. At least one have that fake backdoor flush draw, right? If we have an offsuit ace of heart, let's say we have at least the blocker on a hard run out, something like that. Ace of four, let's have a look. Never like the low ace. Like here we see some traces, ace three, ace two, they start start betting but the ace of clubs is just really really bad you can see why if we use a bigger size i guess on that board mainly let's say 4.5 have a look at villain's folding range suited side it's all the clubs right the other hands were betting before and just folding so many of those combinations here again the ace of clubs should be slightly higher frequency than the other and that's about it okay the deuce we can obviously race we could call let's go for the race this time call the re-race interesting you see polarized I think I mean we go small now can we go half 20 then we have 16 to 80 left that makes sense this year then we have 66 in the middle and 77 I think this is a little more cool it's just a small he seems to be super polarized after that yeah i mean it's fine again one of those no real ev loss and thinking about the right thing 76 now think about the offsuit triangle can this be cool we have some backdoor straights going on could bet this small fold out 79 folding is king seven folding yes they are king six is folding if he has it only suited so offsuit is more important whether he folds queen nine or not is this really like we don't care too much it's about what happens if we make our hand how good is it i think betting is fine checking is fine i think more of a high frequency check and now i think we can obviously start betting rapid two pair at really big or just that small both is fine oh really big i was too small for really big right the smallest fine big is fine really rapid two pair at really big or just bet small both is fine really big i was too small for really big right the smallest fine biggest fine really rapid two pair two pair goes bigger than 125 all right so it's like what i say was correct the button i click was like just a little too small no ev loss really eight six of spades i'm gonna check back and now i think it's an okay one to raise if he bets so it has to be an okay one to bet also. Wrap a five. Like I have five, six suited. Eight, five suited here. With those suits, I block that. So big one. I could even go bigger. Could be fine. It could be fine. I'm not sure. I'm like risking a little. Now, obviously a check is okay. A small bet is okay. Be a little on the risky side. Blocks that. And this seems to be okay, right? He can have hearts that he has here like that. and I'll patch five all in. No, I don't think so. So five could be like this and turn a little too greedy. And then the river, it's a solid bluff, right? Just all in is fine. This is fine. So it's like, again, in the right direction, not the perfect sizing plan, but this is not what it's about, right? It's like small EV differences and using blockers perfectly, using the sizing sizing perfectly it will obviously place different ranges than the solver so it's like more the structure of our range is important then looking something like this one up here it's like the ev loss is what is more important than that gto wizard ranking and this mainly comes from like this is pretty much not a loss some small ones where was the one mistake where we lost quite a lot of ev king jack that called that was like 0.4 already right this was 0.39 i think and we have total loss of 0.66 so i'm very happy actually with my results here and especially the reasonings so here five six we can stab small or we can also check holding out like ten five of clubs is okay right let's bet small this time seven is an okay hand we can follow can follow a queen-jack, queen-10, and so on. Overbet this board now. Small bet, I don't know how often it happens on the flop. Maybe not that often. 12.5, maybe even bigger. Let's do this here. 3, nothing gets there. Do we have good stuff going on for us? Not really. So we cannot just go all the time, and I'll give this one up. River, no way, all-in. All right, so wow wow this is such a strong all-in let's see let's double check now i was checking right so betting is very very cool here on the flop turn over bet is very cool and river just a must must must bluff he has lots of nine eggs of diamonds he has like random diamonds unblocking all that would be better to understand his full calling range probably king five king six are kind of high frequency calls. So my hand is really good. Like this here is now lots of EV that I gave up. 2.7. I just thought like, okay, I get there with lots of potential bluffs. So there won't be a bluff that I bet 100%. And that was just wrong. I thought like it will be mixed. So checking is the safe option here to not mess up. But yeah, clear mistake. Let's have a look. This is a blunder. All right. right so not bluffing the six high there probably makes sense to just go with showdown value right it's not one of the obvious draws and here we go right we should bluff our five six always and we give up our ten eight and this is kind of the obvious we give up jack ten we give up queen ten queen jack that we might sometimes play like this give up the flush draw and the five six is really the one we want to have five six eight five even of diamonds and let's see we'll snap folds and snap calls five it's not about what we block here it's just we unblock all that stuff queens jacks tens king ten king eight a7 is playing like that wow so they're just like none of like sixes and fives really that are folding only diamonds here so we're not blocking any folding range that's that's good enough cool all right one blunder let's do like three more or two rounds of two queen jack here i think is too high up in that officer triangle it's okay to sometimes bet it but it's a little dangerous to just bet here too often i think so i'm checking this one ace 10 is a very clear call let's go side by side against the bet we've seen that a little in the example where villain did bet king queen one that we looked up in the last video and i've seen that like some of those hand types are actually raising it was 883 i think deuce so it was a brick now straights get there so i think we raise a little more the straighty stuff to have equity against his calling range but can't really hurt let's try it we want to be a little greedy crazy here queen and i have no clue whether this is value bet this is something when we raise turn it should be clear what we are doing here 12 let's bet it and probably fold all right so turn right this is something we've learned let's wrap it up here and just take this as the last hand that was pretty cool something we learned i hope you enjoyed that i will be back for the next drill and talk to you soon
