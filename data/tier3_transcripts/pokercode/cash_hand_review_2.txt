### TOPIC: cash hand review 2
 All right, leave a little hi in the chat, guys. Hello, Tucker. Hello, Philip. Koyak, Alejandro, Piaciu. Great to have you here. I guess it's your first coaching. Pavel, Sebastian, Benny. Actually, some people I don't know, which makes me really, really happy. So hey, welcome back, Damien. Welcome back, Pavel, obviously. Jerome, here we go. Jeremy, as always, patience, please. All right, as always, for everyone who is here for the first coaching, we'll wait another two, three minutes to give people enough time to jump in. Make use of the time to just jump into the Kahoot. So today I prepared quite a couple of questions. I'm seeing 32 people in here so far, only 11 in the Kahoot. Make sure to join there. We will look at wide range of spots and big pots. So yeah, we will some in-game hands not too many i want to go a little more in depth in every single one of those i thought about really i gave you the options to think about like action game reaction game but then in those spots i felt like it's always best to look at both sides so we will talk about both sides even better maybe focus a little more on the reaction game as you guys chose and then we go and as i feel already right now i guess you've all read that in the community chat or in the announcement that i'm like over corona and i'm tested free now again so like i'm a free man again but still i feel a little yeah just like talking talking is not what i did the total last seven days so i i might need to drink a little more here and there and take a couple of breaks maybe but we'll fight this one through so yeah thanks for helping out in the chat just kahoot.it as you see here join at www.kahoot.it and then put in the game pin that's all you need to do or take your phone and even i don't know whether it works with that qr code 35 people now to start with just leave leave a like, I can't participate in Kahoot. If you can't in the chat, then I have like a little overview when I don't need to wait anymore. But I think since there are still 10 people not in Kahoot that are in the Zoom meeting, I'm pretty sure we should wait another minute. Living in Vienna, playing high stakes again. Nope. But I was in Vienna and I did play high stakes and I will move to Vienna again end of next month. So actually I will go to Vienna tomorrow and get the keys for my new flat on Friday. So from then on, I will register my account on Austrian address again. And then I'm, I'm a free man when it comes to online poker. All right. Hey, Jin, good to have you here. little jealous of the dark chocolate you can keep your matcha tea that's fine all right first bottle empty let's go for the next one so 29 just still six people missing in kahoot just tell me in the in the chat if you really can't participate in kahoot that's okay obviously it's more fun for the coaching and you learn more by thinking stuff through just because of the questions just just throw yourself into it all right work work work that's fine so let's last last minute is running and i'll just start yeah actually i just figured out i forgot today to start with a little overview how the coaching will look like i forgot that slide so actually yeah this is the next one we'll start with the kahoot so today no overview I can just run you quickly through it. I prepared a little something I found, more to that in a second, I found on Twitter this morning, and I thought it fits very, very well to this coaching. So I put it in here. We'll have a look at that. And then we will take six, maybe seven example hands I chose, where I think we can see some key concepts, some things to think about, some exploitative stuff, as well as some solver work. I prepared all the solves for that so we can go in depth, make use of that. I won't be the nerdy guy and run you through every line there, but if you specifically feel something, okay, this is weird, I don't know why this is the case. Just ask in the chat. I have all the sims here. I'm happy to take five minutes extra to have a deeper look at each of the spots. And this is the plan for today. So from every of those hands, we want to learn something. And then in the end, we'll obviously have some takeaways that I split up into reaction game and action game. So that's the plan in between the hands. I hope I stop in the right moments when reviewing those. I prepared some questions about maybe how I played, maybe about how the solver would play. And then maybe about how I personally like my play in hindsight, trying to not be too biased from this results, but this is the plan. And then as always, we just start in the Kahoot with the open question. So this is part number two of the Kahoot because I just had to redo it five minutes ago. Apparently the word shit is not allowed. So now the starting question, as always, pretty much when you face decisions with wide ranges, our spot today, how do you approach the spot? Let me know what you think about. Yeah. Just for me as an input that I can throughout the coaching, really use your terms, talk about them, put them into perspective, give you new ideas, confirm existing ideas, and so on and so on. Really make use of that. That's your chance to really put the coaching in a direction that suits you the best. Tony, for some reason, you cannot join Kahoot. Did you try on your computer and on your phone? It should still be possible to join now. So kahoot.it and the game pin 1675650, as you should see on the very bottom there. Perfect. So yeah, no rush needed. We have plenty of time today. Just six hands for something like 80, 90 minutes. Let's see how long my voice works out. All right. Let's see. Show answers. That looks he a reg or not who are we playing okay wide ranges i'm trying to look out for the offsuit combos that villain will have and won't have it very very good thing right offsuit combos make ranges whether he has like four straights or six or 12 straights or 16 total when he has offsuit and big difference focus on that that's the majority of each range more three batting i'm not sure what that means but okay looking mainly for best hands to continue a little less concerned with specific suits right something like specificity if that is a word is not that interesting just because yeah it's it's it's wide ranges it's like one blocker won't be the major difference maybe in the end if we go directional in but to start with not that interesting knowing your range and then exploit all right big exploiting very interesting cornerstones of my range a word i will use a lot today so help me build my strategy i think someone someone listen carefully who has the advantage how the equities change over time position player all the general stuff yeah very very good equity advantage not advantage smaller bets as more size buckets not much thinking about blocker until the river very good you think a lot about your opponent right i'll let me say we'll use that in the reaction game for sure right we are reacting to one specific opponent wide ranges everything can mean something tighter pre-flop wide ranges i'm not sure can i improve on the next streets what's the villain like make a relative okay so we have lots of those general things but it's like you see how it's not getting specific which well we can't be specific when we talk about wide ranges. It's way more important. Is that guy aggressive overall? Is he passive? It's like more, you're playing one guy wide ranges against some people you want to maybe be very sticky against some people you want to over-fold against actions against some people you want to be super bluff heavy. So it's really all that. And we're trying to not be too specific. It specific it's not like a three bad four bad pot we know exactly our three value hands and our two bluffs that go with them etc etc so yeah all right let's go from there and some more coming think about where villain has a gap in the range so that we can attack very good with a line graph and determine the sizing when playing the reaction game think about what his bet size and check means in terms of population tendencies i had lots of things in there i will use all of that okay so yeah let's take that as starting point and then go to what i read actually this morning and this was i've seen that tweet because it was liked by no limit gaming and stefan schilheibel so it is from counter-st A Counter-Strike, professional Counter-Strike player and coach did write the following. In German, I translated the main part of it. So he says something like, one of the biggest leaks I spot in nearly every successful player's game is the following. The basics are not getting leveraged to the maximum. I think he means it in a way that they are not training them enough. And he follows up with an example. So maybe you can already transfer that to the poker world. We are not working enough on the basics. And now he comes up with the example and he says something like, yesterday in the group call, there was another example. A participant has big leaks in communication. So Counter- counter strike is a game five versus five and communicating with your mates knowing what is happening where on the map is just crucial and he has a big league there but he prefers to think about supportive grenades right something very very very specific where he like whatever way he throws them best we're like yeah that's some of bullshit. He's saying that he keeps asking good questions, but all about new skills that are relevant at a later point. That's exactly the same thing when people understand coachings in the wrong way. Let's say someone is listening to a Pio NL 20K hand analysis, but it's actually playing NL 10, where all he needs to know is, do you have a good hand, then go for value. But really we try to get better in those small and small areas that are actually irrelevant for us now. And this is even more important when we talk about wide ranges, right? Sometimes we find ourselves in a spot where we want to make the genius hero call thinking about villains should be bluffing this and that. And in the end's just a guy who is never bluffing right that's bullshit obviously maybe it's something we are blind versus blind we want to see that the flop and find the super fancy turn check raise as a bluff with the right blocker we're like yes but maybe villain is just too bad and doesn't realize relative hand strength and it's just calling down top pair plus okay then this is all not relevant so this here very very well to poker and especially wide ranges as well let's go to the third part and this is just his advice right i like the one two three right he has something he spots he explains it he has the right takeaway stop looking for shiny objects keep your game simple there is a d too much and keep working on the basics this is what we are doing today let's we'll talk about cornerstones of our range zoom out of specific situations instead of red blocker is always such a thing that keeps you thinking in a very very wild and and tough direction where let let's say on a river, probably no one has the ranges you will ever see in a solver because just people play differently. And then really working on that specific stuff, what to do here, what to do there, is maybe just the wrong thing. All right. So I think, let's see, right. What does that mean? For me, that just means, especially in wide ranges, I want to keep it simple, especially in the action game. I want to know what I am doing. I don't try to be the genius whenever I didn't master a spot. This is different when I'm sure I know everything about that freaking spot. I just studied a specific spot. I know exactly what's going on, and I can put villain in a very, very tough situation where I know what's going on and he doesn't. But first we need to get there. And getting there is way easier if we just master like the small things, right? It's like, is this just a range bet? Perfect. We play the flop perfectly under our own parameters, but that's like the starting point. And then we can start digging deeper and deeper from there. Right. One thing maybe as well is the wider ranges are getting, the more tempting it is to get creative. You look at your hand, you try to make something happen. I want to move him off this and that hand. I want to get value from this and that. I want to trap here and then go crazy. We're like, yeah, maybe is that all necessary? And instead we should just say, okay, we have two different lines here. We bet this sizing or that sizing, or we check, then it's, that's the third one. And our hand for certain reasons fits into box A, box B, box C. That's it. All we need. And then we make our choice. All right. This is as a starting point, maybe, yeah, this year is the last part. Typical mistakes before really digging deeper and looking at hand. The typical mistakes I spot with wide ranges and with spotting them, I'm not talking about my villains. I'm talking mainly about myself, right? So this is where I really spot it. The good old fancy play syndrome, right? Try to make something fancy happen, but he needs to believe me there. Or whenever there's something super crazy happening, actually, and people are not crazy in general, it's just the super nuts that try to make something weird happen. Then I see a lot of the sizing or action triggered by hand, not playing ranges, right? It's just, oh, I have jacks on a queen high board, so I check. We're like, yeah, in the real world, maybe there's a big range around some strong hands, very strong hands, weak hands, something. And then in the real world, it's always just, yeah, you have pocket jacks. And that happens very, very often in spots like that. And then what I like a lot, and this is a shout out to Garia Poker here, I guess, another Israeli coaching for profit stable from Yuri Pelik, who started that, splitting mistakes up into two categories. And I want to take that over because I like it a lot. And this is very important when we come to, when we talk about wide ranges. One thing is the hand choice mistake, like doing something with a hand that is in the solver world, just not a thing. I didn't make a very, very easy example. We open raise seven dues off from the button. It's not in this world. It's just not happening. Sure. as an exploit with good reasons, we can do anything, but this is a hand choice mistake. And then we have a frequency mistake. Something like, hey, we open raise queen eight offsuit from the button, which should be in my world a mix. It's like, yes, it's correct to open raise it sometimes. It's correct to fold it sometimes. So when you do it always or never, it it's both a mistake but not the hand itself is the mistake just a frequency thing same thing for like yes betting big with kings on a queen high board is correct always doing it and never putting it in the small size is probably wrong though but it's something you can never spot because you look up hands and actually it's correct. And you don't know whether villain did that 80%, 60%, 40% or just 0% or 100%. So this is something I want to keep an eye on, especially when it's about wide ranges, because we look up so many things and often things are fine where we want to maybe dig a little deeper. People are not playing like solvers and let's really think about how they are playing. All right, are you guys ready to jump into some Kahoot questions and the first hands? So now the problem is that I always forget what the question was that's leading up to, but let's see. All right, I have my whole mentor here. So I have a Poker Coaching tag here. Let's hope I find those hands again. But it looks good. Let's start with pocket fives. So we're playing on Inno 2000 today. This is the first hand I chose. I hope you can see it pretty well. And I will have a question regarding the river play here. And yeah, let's just see. I'll guide you through the hand first. I defend. I think it's pretty pure defend. Never three bad, maybe very low frequency, but that's it. We flop a bottom set on a pretty dryish board. That's pretty cool. You see that's small. I think we can have any check raise. Sizing is fine. We should check raise pretty much 100% here with that hand. So I went with a 75% check raise, which is this here. He ends up calling. Turn is a six, which is a beautiful card for our check raising range. We definitely want to use big bets at high frequency. We have seven, four a lot. We have seven, nine. We have all the seven X and six X six, five, maybe stuff that, that just connects here very, very well. That would be a very different on a, on a Broadway card. So I'm using the two E sizing linear directional in this hand pretty much always wants to bet. And this is about pot. I was just guessing in game, not doing the math. So not nailing it, but I think this is close enough. And the river is one of the worst cards in the deck. Just bringing the flush and the straight there. It's obviously one of the worst cards for my hand, but not necessarily for my range. Now it's very, very close. I still have a block bet for value. Villain can have aces, ace-king, king-queen, king-jack, king-ten. How many sevens does he actually have? Talking about offsuit and suited combos against that big flop check raise. Yes, he's having six, seven, seven, eight. Pocket sevens already close. Are they always c-betting? Are they always calling a big check raise? Who knows? So I like to be on the value-heavy side here, or like on the thin value side, and I go for a block bet. Now, what always happens in this spot, and we all know it, that it always happens, is a big jam. And now, yeah, we have the first guessing game in the Kahoot. I hope you all see the spot, you all understood the spot. We check-raise, We bet directional in on the turn. If we were deeper or I did check race smaller on the flop, then we definitely overbet the turn. But here pot size was enough to exactly or pretty much leave pot size behind for the river. So yeah, that was my plan. And now the first Kahoot question. See? Did I call or did I fault? Did Stefan call? Is that true or is that false? What's your freaking guess here? Not much times, 20 seconds. How can I answer? You have like that blue with that queer on your phone or on your computer and the red one. That should be it. Just click on that. Fold low stakes, call high stakes. Okay. That's what people do. This is why they call against me. So actually I ended up calling. And now before showing him his hand, let's think about the next thing, right? And this is something we will do a lot today. Not just, oh, he has it or he has it not, whatever. Even with those wide ranges, we started on the flop. He can have king, queen. He can have eight X. He can have whatever. He can obviously have a flush. We should try to find the spots that we actually want to think about. Someone writes here, Kami writes, five of clubs is awesome. Yes, we are blocking definitely a lot of flushes. Ace, five of clubs. King, five of clubs. Queen, five of clubs. Five, well, five, six, five, four is blocked from the board anyway. So maybe five, seven as well. Jack-5 of clubs, so 5 hands he would definitely play like that. But now let's think about that. Next question. What should be villain's thinnest value raise? Now talking about the solver world. Villain's thinnest value raise here. Is N7, just a 7 with nothing to go with it, good enough? Does he need 9-7 for the nut straight? Is it any flush or just the jack-high flush and better? All right, so we have two knits here with a jack-high flush. Some other people saying actually 7 is enough. I mean, I should be protected with clubs and with 9-7 and 7 myself. So I see, I'm not sure whether 7 is a jam to move me off the split because I mean, I'm not value betting two pairs. So a 7 is actually just trying to get value from fives and eights. Close, right? So, and now, yeah, actually now let's run the hand and I'll give you my in-game thought here. King X clubs must be a block by the river. I think we mix all kinds of things here. And yeah, it depends a lot on what we think. So here, my thought process was that this guy is not jamming a naked seven here. And then it's actually just a flush or potential bluffs. And there are lots of potential bluffs. Pocket aces, ace-king with the ace of clubs. Any king with a king of clubs can think about that jam, and then I just have a pretty good price and I value my five of clubs as a very very strong blocker here to make that cap. All that is only true when my assumption is correct that he's not jamming a seven. Can he turn ace king with ace or king of clubs into a blocker? Potentially, right? I mean I'm wrapping exactly what I'm having and he's then wrapping a flush and he definitely has flushes so it's it's something and these are offsuit combos and i block at least like three four or five flushes and against the big sizing it's very likely that he's maybe not floating enough of like a random jack nine of clubs is that floating and yeah so i make the decision that he's not jamming a pure seven because i'm not seeing that too often people are nitty when it comes to that especially when i'm protected and in hindsight i'm very very happy with that catch for that reason but my read was just off and he kind of have to admit right he just outplayed me here because if he jams a seven this gets a very very bad catcher not blocking anything of the sevens and it's like fine enough i have enough seven x that play like that and then i obviously should go more with my absolute hand strength just call the seven right so let's just have a look there at pile to confirm that and this is how i want to see it right this is the correct word so i only offered his standard like third pot 30 c-bet. He can almost seabed full range. I, as I said, have like almost a hundred percent check raise with that hand. So let's do that. And now first thing I'm saying is it's maybe likely that he misses some of those that you see, like it's $300 in the pot. And this has an EV of $5. There is a chance people are not doing that. So this is the first one where I discount some flushes on the river here. This is, yeah, not the easiest float that everyone does, but everyone is calling King Queen, obviously. So now, when calls turn was the six of clubs, I guess. We have multiple sizings. This year is the chosen one, pretty much pot size. This is directional in. Yeah, I did 440 and 440. This year is 4's 444 is the perfect math so slightly off but i think we are fine with that pocket fives always want to bet that card is just so great that we almost always bet and yes he obviously has a call well 7-4 is not a button open raise in my world here but we can just see it as like 7-9 pretty much right so he call only jam sixes. That's fair enough to just get it in against fives now. And yeah, he calls and the river is a four of clubs. So first decision, how good is my block bet? Feels okay, right? So the one without the five of clubs is somehow slightly better. Not sure why that is the case, but okay. So I see it's like indifferent. So I like to be on the value heavy side there. And I'm very, very happy with my block bet here. And then on the river, it's important to really think about what should he be raising? So first of all, we see that aces is his first jam. Even the one without the clubs is a fine jam here. That's a little fancy, but okay. So ace king, like sometimes it's okay, but it's easy to overdo it if you jam like lots of them. King queen should never jam pretty much. So it's easy to overdo it here. And what I think as well is those years seven is just indifferent between jamming or not. Seven nine, yes, that's a clear one. The naked seven is just indifferent. It's fine. So this is the one I don't expect people to be doing where I was apparently wrong. Right? So I got owned here in a way because that was my reasoning to make a light catch. Thank you. indifferent, it's fine. So this is the one I don't expect people to be doing where I was apparently wrong, right? So I got owned here in a way, because that was my reasoning to make a light catch. And because of that seven that is included in his range, you see that for example, a seven can sometimes fold. It's indifferent. I should only call seven X and my fives are actually just losing. You see, just looking at the different combinations of fives, you can still see the big influence that the five of clubs has, but a difference of like a hundred dollars in the solver world here. But I still stick to my assumptions. And I think that against that type of player, I didn't have any more reads than just, yeah, it's just kind of a standard 1K, 2K player. I think that's mainly correct. In that case, I was off and I have to give him lots of credit for that. And I do so, but I'm super happy with my decision. If that is hopefully not the next question. Sometimes I ask you whether I'm still happy with my decision. So this is the type how we will go through the hands. So this is your chance now to ask anything else about that type of hand, but you've seen like how we broken it down. Like every single time we make a decision, right? we have a range bet from villain i check race i know more or less how my check raise range looks like hand but you've seen like how we broken it down like every single time we make a decision right we have a range bet from villain i check raise i know more or less how my check raise range looks like i decide a certain sizing here i chose 75 we can build the game tree with different sizes as well i evaluate the turn card find the correct sizing to use go from there then on the river four i make another decision with the block bet or no block bet. Any hand would be interesting here. And then from then on, facing a gem, I'm in the reaction game. Again, trying to make some assumptions, having an idea of what I expect, thinking about what could he be doing wrong. And here, I think it's more likely that people are over bluffing because just like I can feel it. You have ace king with the ace of clubs. It's so tough to not jam it in there. King queen with a random club. It's so tough to not jam there, et cetera, et cetera. So I think it's very, very likely that you end up over bluffing. And yeah, for two reasons, because it's easy to have too many bluff combos in the first place and to have not enough thin value combos. The other thing. All right. Do you block flushes too? I mix that a little. little so yeah i do block some flushes as well how will you play your two pair on this board check river same same until the river and then check like if i have eight five here this is just a river check not strong enough and then hope for the check check against king queen how does our strategy on the river change if the four isn't a club i assume we also just block bet and and call more. Well, relatively our hand is just way stronger. Villain doesn't have so much 7x, so it's close. Pocket fives are still good enough to jam. It's very close though, right? You see like the EV difference here. It's very, very close. Do you check fold 100%? Well, I have a catcher with pretty much anything I'm checking, but I think this is a spot where it's tough to find the bluffs. So if the river is a four of clubs, I'm checking. Villain needs to jam something like king-jack as a bluff, king-ten as a bluff, king-nine as a bluff. This is something I'm not seeing, and that's why this is a spot I'm dramatically overflowing for that reason. If people are finding enough bluffs, we can have a look here. Well, our random two pairs are indifferent all of a sudden. What if I have... where is it? I mean, not even king-eight because it's blocking bluffs we can have a look here well our random two pairs are indifferent all of a sudden if i have where is it i mean not not even king eight because it's blocking bluffs but where is like an eight eight five is close but like it turned i mean the six four right it's like something fives we're not betting is a call something like that you like villain calling race yes it's a mandatory call with that stack death it's important that we have lots of stack behind so just hitting that six gives him a lots lots lots lots of money aces as a bluff too yeah that's correct nice drone so no clue about heisting's tendencies of course but for say 200 and 0 wouldn't you like overfolding since he has some kind of showdown value he has to turn into a bluff we almost always have a bluff catcher not too much air so not a great spot to put pressure on us partly because it because it's like, I don't give him a free option. He has showdown value, but he doesn't like to call. Like he doesn't want to call his ace king here. So he has not other options. If it was after checking on the river, I don't like calling at all because then the typical NL 200 player, I mean, you will never see that someone jams his king nine then. He takes the free showdown, hopes to win, and that's it. So then if his other option is the check back, then I think no one is bluffing. On lower stakes, that's definitely true. And yeah, against the block bet, it just is very tempting to jam. Maybe Pedro jams king nine, definitely. All right, so let's get to the next one. Next one is more about what villain does actually, but I want to evaluate it correctly. So think about what we talked about the frequency and the hand choice mistakes. All right. So let me get to the next 10 or first year. I have a little summary for that hand. And number one was a check raise. And then the follow-up, we thought about how should villains river raising range look like first, what be right in theory? Then what is villain doing wrong? We obviously cannot know without a read. But by knowing the right answer, what would be the thinnest value raise? What are the offsuit combos he's having and how much is he allowed to bluff? I think here I found out in-game, I have the clear answer that it's likely that people are too value heavy. I think that would be a little different if the flush draw was there right on the flop, for example. Then he just has more flushes in general. But on king-8-5 rainbow against that big check raise I used, yeah, I'm not sure how many flushes he actually has. So it's very, very likely that he ends up over bluffing. And then think about your calling strategy. I was in that world that I said, hey, he has a flush or a bullshit, and then my five of clubs is a game changer. If he has that seven X, which he had, I was totally off. And you have to accept that. Mark it. He played it perfect. I made a light call, given some assumptions. That was probably maybe slightly losing, maybe not. Who knows? So, all right. Hand number two. Where is it? Let me see. Hand number two. Okay. With that speed, we get to three hands, but that's fine. So that was a nice hand. So here we are playing heads up. Ranges cannot get way wider. This guy was open seating in a 1k. So I tried to battle him. I don't know that guy. I had no clue. And he seemed fairly aggressive to begin with. We've walked two pair and a villain chooses whatever. We don't see it. $14.60, like a 30% sizing% sizing with that like potentially cooler under a cooler I decide to just call check raising is not that great just building a pot against nine tens and jack eights and and like all the draws in the world is not perfect and rather play it passively turn is a perfect part full break nothing improves can have equity and villain chooses a weird that we still cannot see 93 50 sizing 116 i don't know what it is just guessing could think about raising i go with a call here and now we have an offshoot king on the river and villain decides to bet all of it so it's uh 1100 pretty much into 266 we face four times pot this is not a question the kahoot but still help me in the chat. One for the call, two for the fold. Just write it in there. One for the call, two for the fold. All right. So we see lots of folds. We see some calls. All right. So I told you everything I knew was he's fairly aggressive. And then in a heads up game, I'm just not overfolding to start with. I want to have the read. If he checks back a clear bluff here, then I start overfolding. But to start with, this should be a very high frequency pile call. So I make the freaking call. And let's see, we did win the hand and we've seen a queen three of spades from someone open seating 1k battling Rex regularly here. So let's think about that hand and about villain's strategy here. And we go step by step. So you all have the hand in mind. I think maybe I can, I think I have need the space for the Kahoot. So try to think about the board, memorize it, and then I'll ask you about the plays. All right. So Damien in the lead. Very easy. True or false? Is villain's flop play okay? True for it is okay, false for it's not okay. In the solo world. He made the most of you guys' fault. All right, so flop play is indeed okay-ish. Let's go to the turn. Is villain's turn play on the turn fine? True for yes, absolutely fine. False for no, definitely not. Alright, here we go. This is a little more clear. The last one. Is Willems river play fine. All right, so eight people think it's fine again. So you see, now we need to be sure that we evaluate things correctly here, because just him blowing up here doesn't necessarily mean he did make big mistakes somewhere. In this case, I can tell you he did, but let's have a look. So I ran that hand as well with obviously heads up. It's a lot about the parameters. I just tried to use his sizings. So any other parameters will lead to different outcomes. So don't take that for granted here. And I just gave him two options to see that a big, see that a small, see that he only chooses the small c-bet. I don't know. So what you see here is now the definition of wide ranges. Everything is fine. Queen, three of spades, sometimes betting. I mean, I didn't run that forever. You see still like EV differences, but I think small bet, we cannot say it's like very, very bad. So on the flop, maybe he has a frequency mistake by just going very high frequency, but not necessarily a hand choice. He has an overcard on the board where he should still have range advantage. So it's like, how bad can it be? How does it work? Once you make a big mistake on the turn, does it compound or is it just another mistake? That's more like how you see it. I don't know. It depends on like lots of parts in the game tree. Maybe you can make up for that later. Consciously make a mistake because you play later streets better, right? If he bluffs too light to then over bluff the river and I over fold the air, he's winning the money. So it's not that easy. Hand choice mistake and frequency mistake for Bloom. So, so far on the flop, we have a frequency mistake right or may potentially we don't know maybe he just rolled a 25 i don't know so he c bets my jack seven one thing wide ranges cooler over a cooler cooler under a cooler is always a thing right so when you have the nuts you want to fast play a lot before there's the freaking nine of hearts somewhere so my my 10, nine is probably the hand that wants to check raise highest frequency. Jack seven or something like, yeah, seven, eight, jack eight is like, is that not it? Not really, right? So this is a slow play, wait for more stuff to come. So we are calling here, turn was a deuce of clubs, checking again. Villain now, I gave him multiple options. His sizing was this year, which is fine to choose. And now let's have a look at the hands. We have the double flush draw, something like pocket queens can obviously overbet here for value. Something like ace jack can do that. Maybe bluffs like ace nine of hearts, ace nine of clubs. But the queen three of spades is definitely not a thing. But still we see here, just because wide ranges, I'm obviously folding enough there. He's losing 20 cents, right? So it's like, how bad is it? And yeah, now keep that thought, nevermore, because I'll ask that next pretty much. And now let's get to the river. The river was the king of diamonds, I guess. So 94, we do call here our jack seven, mandatory call, obviously. And the river is the king of diamonds. And first we see all in exists. 70%, not too bad. 10, nine can jam can exactly play that way. King Jack. Maybe not the turn too often like that, but it's fine to jam pocket Kings. What else could we have pocket eights pocket sevens that small or jam. It's all fine. If he jams our jack seven is kind of a random catcher right like a 40 50 percent call our jack eight calls a little more often king eight is the first mandatory call kind of and then we have all the peers plus blocker that are like frequency whatever but it's really tough to be over folding here let's say that right so he does that and now let's have a look at his bluff queen three of spades we have a clear pattern that bluffing seems okay but jamming seems not good and this leads us to the next question where's the kahoot so here we go open-ended question i want to know why don't i like villains river sizing and i had to redo the kahoot because first i said like why don't I like villains river sizing? And I had to redo the Kahoot because first I said like, why don't I like his super shitty river jam? And somehow words like shit is not allowed here. Only gave you 30 seconds. Don't rush. You can take your time. The answers will fly in. So why don't I like villains river sizing? Keep the answers coming. Does not make sense. Why doesn't it make sense? He has value hands, so he can bluff. You have draws. On the river, there's no more card coming, so we don't have draws. Needs a lot of fold equity. That's correct, but we have seen that the sizing exists, so we should have bluffs. It's hard for us to overfold against that size. Yeah, who knows, but they are bluffs. The majority of our folds is busted flush draws. No need for big size. Yes, that's somewhat correct. Here we go. Smaller bet will achieve the same thing, namely getting our busted flush draws with peer or gut shot plus peer to fold. Easy to react. He is over bluffing. Yes, he was indeed. Maybe I'm over folding, then over bluffing is good. Doesn't block the straight. I'm mainly check-raising straights before, so the straight is not the biggest issue, but he's not blocking my calling hands. So there's no queen that will go all in, so it does not work with the lookalike principle. Yes, a bit smaller, twice pot, does the same. Yes, or just 75%. Inelastic calls against the straight, blocking no equity bluffs. Yes, he has no blockers, correct. All right. So really, when you use a very, very large sizing, it means you need a lot of fold equity. You really want to make sure villains pretty much never call. So you should block like his auto calls in any way, or at least make use of the lookalike principle that your bluffs look the same way, like your value hands, just that I cannot react with blockers. I might be sitting there with Jack 10. I blocked 10, nine. So I call. So you want to have the fact that, well, my Jack 10 not only blocks his value, but his bluffs as well. So the ratio kind of stays the same. And here, what he did was like really taking a hand that is super shit blocker wise, that he bluffs. And if I call my jack 10, I'm blocking his value, not blocking his bluffs. And then in that way, I can influence his ratio. And really, I like this hand to bluff. I think his biggest mistake is the turn. Turn, he has a clear 0% bet with a hand that has no equity whatsoever. Yes, an over card, but when a double flush draw board without any of the flush draw cards, that's just not good. But on the river, the bluff is good enough for him to just fold out my busted flush draws. But for that, he doesn't need a big sizing. So let's have a look there again. We see that he should be jamming. 70% jam, 26% small sizing. So what is jamming? 10-9, jacks, kings, eights, sevens, super nuts. And then, wow, what a surprise, the lookalikes. 10-6, 9-6, 10-5, 10-6 suited, 10-5 suited. Right here, even the 10-5 of hearts, something like that, but that is just is just yes i need to make fold more than just the busted flush draws because i blocked the busted flush draws i need that big sizing queen three of spades is not getting there right so but if we force him to play queen three of spades on the river it's actually a small bluff here so this year is just a clear hand choice mistake, probably not understanding a pattern, right? Not in crazy, right? I small bluff here. So this here is just a clear hand choice mistake, probably not understanding a pattern, right? Not in crazy, right? I'm bluffing. If I get to the river there, I'm just bluffing small because I have a clear goal in mind what I try to fold out. Yes, he threw his dirty underwear in the very, very wrong wardrobe, just into the white camisetas. It's like really the, fuck it, right? He messed up. So now this is something where we can really make notes, probably completely over the top, Thank you. camisetas it's like really the fuck it right he messed up so now this is something where we can really make notes probably completely over the top not understanding this or that concept that's like you can go crazy and over bluff here but then please take this hand and bet 75 that's all good so really from just one hand we can learn so much about villain and learn so much ourselves understanding the whys. What is the thing here? How do we want to play certain hands? Okay, so let's see. What's the next hand? There, one more question. Question number seven. No, that was that. All right, so we get to the summary and then the next hand. How about he doesn't know his image is bad among other acts? Doesn't know his image is bad? I don't know. We started playing. We we didn't have any images going what is the note you take here to apply this in future just he's crazy over the top not using lookalike right just writing that down that means i'm calling my blockers right i'm not looking at absolute hand strength too much i can just call my jack nine jack ten a hundred percent there in that spot and this is where i make. Because now my zero EV catcher in theory gets highly, highly plussive when he chooses the wrong hands to bluff. Would you raise him when he bet 25%? And a 25% bet on the river in that spot shouldn't exist. So I don't want to think about it too much. But if he bets 75%, which is really realistic, I would definitely raise. Yes. Because then he wraps the river king so hand number two call down spot think about how should villains bluffing range look like both turn and river what is he doing wrong in which direction is villain likely deviating in that spot very likely over bluffing if he does this type of stuff on the turn and then build your calling strategy we where here given that read we have now we want to focus more on blockers he has full shit and he doesn't care about how the full shit looks like and he has straight so when we block the straight it's just very very likely he's full of full shit and this will boost our eb all right and number three let's freaking go and l2k again this is sometimes a three bet call. I call here. I flop a bottom pair backdoor flush draw. And if you follow the check raising lesson, you know that this is a fine hand to sometimes check raise as I do with my pocket sixes. I have a more or less clean two pair out with that four. That would be different when it's like a six, seven or six, nine. Then it's kind of a dirty two pair out. The backdoor flush draws, obviously great. And yeah, let's freaking go. He calls. Turn is a beautiful card. I think we have multiple options. We are ahead of ace, queen, ace, jack. We are ahead of all other flush draws with our pair. We can still get better hands to fold. Just sometimes a 10 can fold now. Sevens, eights, nines, jacks, queens, something like that. So betting is fine. Checking is fine. Yeah, when I bet, I go still. The 3 doesn't change anything. So I still go directional in as I would with my pocket 6s. And then we get the full break on the river. I think we shouldn't have too much 4 or 5. So the deuce doesn't change things. We are ahead of the ace, ex of diamonds. We We are ahead of the ace-axe of hearts. We are ahead of queen-jack. We are ahead of other busted flush draws he has. So I think we have a very, very mandatory check here. And now we face a jam. All right. So let's have a look what the Kahoot question is. I totally forgot. All right. Did I play it like the solver? So actually I did end up calling. I should have said that. Now, yes. Did I play it like a solver? True or false? Anything I said, was that wrong? Is that a solver call on the river or not? All right. So we're all on the solver bootcamp and I've seen your question, Jerome. I'll answer it after we went through that hand. Alright, next question. Stefan likes how he played his hand. Okay, I don't like it and I will explain you why. Alright, let's first double check the solver. Willem can see, but high frequency, obviously he went with this sizing. And then I have the six, four of diamonds, which is an absolutely fine check raise. A check raise call turn is the, what was it? Three of diamonds. But again, my sizing is on point two E directional in we take the sixes, do that all day long. Six, four of diamonds is like 50-50. Anything is fine, just how our hand performs here. So we bet. We know we get called by all the nut flush draws in the world that we have beat. We get called by queen jack. So first queen jacks, those with hearts should actually already fold. I think it's pretty likely that they don't. Something like king 10 is jamming. That's important for us that he has less value on the river. I think this a6 jamming is just not happening in this world. And yeah, so we're pretty happy so far. River is the deuce of spades. We have a very, very clear call. You see how much showdown value we still have. $1,400 in the pot. We should win $270 of that just by having to check-check against nut flush draws. And now again, like in the very first hand on that flushy straight he ran out, let's think about is it likely that villain over bluffs or that he under bluffs? And for that, we can just guess or we can have a look what would be right. If we check to him, he needs to check back all nut flush draws. So as soon as he bluffs one of the nut flushes, the busted nut flush draws, like an ace four of hearts here, he's incredibly over bluffing. First of all, he folds some queen jack on the turn, and now on the river he is not allowed to bluff all of them. So as soon as he bluffs something like queen jack offsuit with a jack of hearts, he is clearly over bluffing. He should jam something like king queen, which I think lots of people are just very happy to check back. So it's very, very likely that people end up bluff heavy, correct? Does that make sense? Why not jam river and play like as if we have sixes? Am I misapplying lookalike principle? Just because we have too much showdown value. That makes sense in theory, but our six has so much showdown value that, yeah, we just, we have so many weaker hands that we want to bluff here. So lookalike principle, that's not our main goal. It helps in lots of situations. Here, it's actually misleading because, yeah, just bluffing a hand that wins almost $300 at showdown. Yes. Assuming that he sometimes bluffs the ace of hearts, my call is absolutely printing. Correct. And if he doesn't have those thin value bets, it's even more printing. So now I click through the hand pretty quickly. And in theory, I love my hand, but in this specific spot, not. And the reason is this year, the solve I've shown you only used a half pot sizing, and this is not what happens in reality. So maybe you have played lots of similar boards to that. What people do is just click their standard hotkey. And here is why I don't like my hand in hindsight, because I forgot about that. I played the hand as if I played against the normal sizing. Sure, sizing up is fine here, but this is what, like the perfect example, what I call what sizing triggered by hand. He has king, queen, there are draws, he sizes up. Typical thing. And people, it's okay to do that, but people usually just forget the bluffs. That's because you don't get triggered in the same way. If you have ace of hearts, five of clubs, you just click your freaking 25, 30% hotkey instead of betting big and this here is maybe the hand is still fine i don't know about this guy maybe he's just using half pot but my experience tells me that this just strengthens his range and it's way more likely that his random eight nine that his random queen jack just clicks the hotkey and this is what is shifting now his range towards value on that river now what hurts me the most is that he actually showed up with one of the thin value bets on the river that i discount against lots of players and he had exactly that king queen we're like yes maybe i shouldn't have check raised that kind of hand against his line in the first place maybe i shouldn't check call the river maybe i shouldn't bet the turn so yeah it's just i wasn't sure at that point of time Thank you. his line in the first place. Maybe I shouldn't check call the river. Maybe I shouldn't bet the turn. So yeah, it's just, I wasn't sure at that point of time how much to read into that. And the only thing that annoys me is just that on the river, I forgot about his half pot sizing. And now this is something to think about here as well. I don't know whether that is true or not. It's just a little population read I'm having here. Do you like his shove versus population? I think he's free rolling on the river. So I like the shove. It's just people can level themselves into something. No one is checking a better hand there as a trap on the river. Not really. Or at least I'm not seeing it. So another hand, check raise and then follow up. How should villain's laughing range look like? How is villain likely to be deviating? In this looking at the solver, I think it's very, very likely that he is like in which direction as well oh two times the same thing something didn't work with the copy paste here so here i think it's very very black white spot that it's just like it's more about which hands does he get there with and what is missing here why we see here one thing is double is i i really wanted to write down here look at every single street Don't forget information you gained on the first street, but keep that in mind. I don't have that. I want to get that soon where people like a program that shows you the whole Hancher Street, just like something bet 50%, call check race, call whatever. And then you have it like all together. This is because this happens when multi-tapling just like, damn it, what happened exactly? Or something like, we have seen that a lot in other examples, but when people size up, people see that 30% on the flop, standard 75 on the turn, on the river, they scroll up to 90. Like just seeing something like that, which is tough to spot with just the absolute sizes here. And this is here why I don't like my river call, that I think it's possible to have a very, very clear read on the flop here. Not saying that it's necessarily true. It's just, yeah, in my eyes, it's very likely. Yeah, exactly. I won. Ace-King was not always a sharp and solver. Yes, I'm jamming King-Queen plus pretty much. Yeah. It's just the thing is that if you jam all that, it's highest EV for villain to just check his nuts on the river. But in the real world, I'm no this is not happening and i'm like this would be a weird back-to-back exploit this is just not happening so i'm attacking that and because there are hands like that that are likely calling and if villain is never trapping i'm just free rolling with a good thin value shove on the river would we say villain is a well-studied solver we cannot say that at all no it's like i don't know maybe just like top pair is good enough for him maybe remember the last hand of the wsop main event this year where someone in it i mean in not a similar spot but or like a similar spot where the river was the nine or something and then jams his king queen so it could still mean anything i need more info on that and his overall stats need to be sound and after a while so it's yeah just one hand is not enough okay the big learning from that is understanding the solver is good but really take into account all the information we're having which i missed here all right little reminder for your previous question let's go a but about last hand. Again, question about lower stakes. Just thinking this crazy overbet fits well in action triggered by hand. Do you always start with what the solver does versus an unknown or would you go with action triggered by hand at lower stakes? At lower stakes, I would use more just population tendency. It's a different thing whether I sit down against someone who is open seating those stakes on a 1K, 2k heads up, which means he's probably fighting other good players and therefore has to be a somewhat good player. So this was my state going into that match. I was just like, let's freaking own him. I want to win that seat, right? So and then I cannot start by over-folding. If the same thing on NL50 and I'm just saying it's too creative and I just start with overfolding against that, that's a totally fine approach. Yes. All right. So hand number four. Let's see what is the question. Okay. Now there's a next question coming up. We have another heads up match here. I can't get way wider than those ranges. I defend king eight offsuit and this flop goes check, check. Turn is the queen of clubs. So flush gets there. Ace jack gets there. Jack nine gets there. I decide to still bet 75% of the pot. He calls. River is another king. It shouldn't change too much actually. I bet another 75%. I mean my kicker is not playing but should be good enough with those trips here. And villain decides to go a little crazy, risking 610 dollars to win those 210. All right, so Jeremy just wait for it and we'll see what we do. I hope everyone got the action. Villain checks back. I'll just run it through quickly again. Villain checks back on king 10-4. We bet 75% on that turn. We bet 75% on the river. Villain goes for the large race. And now obviously the question is, what did I do? This is a very different villain, not the queen deuce crazy guy. Very different one. Again, you can treat him as a 1k, 2k unknown. So what was my in-game decision? I randomized, I overfold all day long, I snap him off, I jam and wrap a boat. Alright, so we got the team randomizer, we got the overfold team. I was in team snap call here. I didn't give you the reasons so far, but actually it was one of those great spots. While I couldn't explain to you before, but this year is the biggest reaction game spot in the world for me here. Someone decides to check back a board that he could easily range bet on. This is what I mean with reaction game. That means it means something. He has something specific. And so far, I couldn't tell you that read, but I've seen five out of five checkbacks he had were mid pairs. Typical thing. A checkback range here obviously should contain all kinds of things. Check back some ace king, check back some ace jack. But it's very, very unlikely that people are playing like the solver. They aren't having those frequency checkbacks. It's way more likely that this is a type of player, c-betting polarized, king x plus, and check back queens, jacks, tens, every 10x. That's it, right? Probably not checking back here. So actually, this was one of the spots where I thought about overbetting the river to get the maximum, but I was more like, no, it's such a nice spot where he could raise. I was betting and was hoping for him to raise. Obviously, if we put that in the solver, it's a zero EV call. Yeah. So here I did that and let's have a look. Yes, absolutely. Nevermore. That's it. So let's have a look at that solve here. I hope I have it or I'm pretty sure I have it since I was swimming all morning. Those spots take forever. All right. So I only gave him that small bet. And this is what I mean here. He 75% bet, right? He could range bet. That's fine. I don't find a single hand that clearly wants to check maybe a six off.. But if we look at that, ace-jack should check back 10% of the time. No, it looks like always betting. Ace-king should check back 10% of the time. Definitely not freaking happening. 10x, jack-10, yeah, it looks like 50-50. Very likely that it's getting checked back. 10-9, very likely. 10-8, very likely. 10-7, very likely. Yes, queens and Jacks, very likely as well. Queens is a little problem. So what if he uses geometric bet sizing? I don't know what you mean, Kamil. Can you explain that? Like which street, which should he start with? Like a large flop bet or what do you mean? Overbet flops only doesn't fit that he has like lots, like his weaker stuff wants to bet as well. Just like I have so much shit on that board. He wants to bet pocket fives to fold out my eight, nine. Yeah, if he overbet flops only, then he can maybe play a very polarized strategy. Oh, can you follow full screen? Here we go, sorry. Okay, so what I mean here, it's just very likely that people don't end up with the mixes like that. They look at ace king, they see bet 100%. They look at jack 10, they check 100%. If you have that read, he checked back five out of five checkbacks were mid pairs so far. So what happens? Goes check, check, turn is a queen of clubs. I can bet, I can check. I decided to bet 75% is a perfect sizing here. And then he obviously calls his check back 10. He doesn't have that. He doesn't have that. He doesn't have that. It's just, no, it's not the case. Don't be scared of those solver 5%ers. And that changes the strategy quite a lot. River was another king. Any king is good enough for 75%. And yes, he can take his jack 10 and sometimes bluff with a club. He can take his 10-9 and sometimes bluff with a club. Because he has this hand as value, he has ace-jack as value, this here as value, and some of those low check back flush draws. Believe it or not, I don't. I think he always has this hand, this hand, this hand, or this hand. So it's just, yeah, very, very easy to snap him off all day long. We're really like hoping for that. And it's like, I played that hand five minutes ago. I still remember that feeling. He uses a very, very big sizing and had sizing and had queen 10 we're like i'm wrapping flushes and maybe bluffs as well but his queen 10 like blocking that boat that doesn't make any sense and you see like that queen 10 is very very bad candidate for a big race yeah so it's like that yeah spooky i have blocker to boat not blocker i want to go crazy i have advantage here he needs to fall the king where in reality that's bullshit he's just like representing a range that he doesn't have after the flop check back and this is what i mean with reaction game i'm reacting to what he did on the flop he checks back maybe 10 15 he always has a 10 right i was going maybe even too thin on the turn if he has always jack 10 and queen 10 so i was lucky on the river but him punting 600 into me yeah another thing is that i was never bluffing pretty much starting on the turn right so if we look that up but let's say he had jack 10 here we look it up he played it perfectly if he has jack 10 with a jack of clubs and i'm 100 sure he would have done the same thing clear frequency mistake it looks like he played perfect in reality, was not bluffing and i was always calling right we can look it up here my king eight is obviously just a random sometimes call and it felt very very very different all right so this is the risk there to to work with the solvers when actually your flop strategy just is totally different maybe he played perfectly like that and i was just lucky but it. All right, summarize that one. Reaction game. When Willem checks back and we start betting, it can actually still be the reaction game. Whenever he had a high frequency spot, when he checks back something like 6-4-3 and has all kinds of stuff, I wouldn't consider that a reaction game. And that can allow us to actually not play versus a range. We can start playing versus a hand. I was like jack 10 let's go how to get the maximum out of that give him trouble that he doesn't want to call then he thinks about the race let's go frequencies mistakes on the rivers can be huge yes absolutely especially when you just wrap something that you do not have when you play as if you have the solver range but you don't if you play that exact range on the flop then all is good but yeah all right so hand number five two more to go not perfect in the time but that's fine so 10-9 offsuit another guy another heads up two hands on him that's it kind of similar board just without the flush draw you see that's high frequency we turn to pair reverse an ace and we have to make make a decision. All right, spot is clear. So in general, you are calling way wider or inducing when people are wrapping to be balanced when they are problem not. Exactly. When I know their hand, I play against their hand, and then I'm not scared of anything. I put him on their hand, I know their hand, and then I get the maximum out of it. I was really happy to see that race at that moment, even though it puts my hand in theory from a value bet to a zero EV call. But I just knew I win $600 here. Obviously, this needs reads, right? Reaction game, he checks back. I always write down when people check back high frequency CBET ports. But if someone checks back here, I write it down. Monkey on drugs principle. Exactly. Okay. So again, this end, we call a small flop bet. We turn two pair. Goes check, check. Unfortunately, river is an ace. We have to think, we have to make a plan. Okay. Let's get the Kahoot out there. Is that second, last action? Second, last question. Second, last question. So Thomas crushing it. Okay. See. Multi-select. All right. What is Stefan mainly thinking about on the river? With my 10, 9, 2 pair. Oops. The dive principle is obviously the dice principle, guys. Forgive this typo. This is not a hidden trap. That was not enough time. Oh. Alright, so yeah, I was not thinking too much about villain's bluff-likeliness. I don't give a shit here. I was thinking about the dice principle. There is an ace on the river. How to get the max. There's an ace. That's the next best hand he can have. How to get the maximum out of that. This is just what the definition of the dice principle is. I have a five. He rivered potentially a four. How do I get the maximum out of it? Second thing I'm thinking about is the lookalike principle. I have a 10 and nine. How do I play a 10? And how do I play a nine here? So everyone can please write in the chat what i did here in that spot after listening to that now raise jam check raise check raise all right schedule of olympic games the day after i don't even know whether that was played during olympic games but check raise check raise check raise here we go and so this is not a specific big spot or interesting thing this This is just my definition of having cornerstones of our range. This is overbet and check raise are brothers always for me. But this is where the lookalike principle comes into play. If I have pocket deuces here, for example, then I can just overbet because it's not worth a lot for me to protect my deuce X. But since I have all kind of nine X and all kind of 10 X, I want to play this hand the same way. So check, check. If he doesn't bluff then that's fine because then my nine X and 10 X wins at showdown. If he does bluff a lot, well, I maybe fold this, but I get extra value with this lookalike hand. And against an ace, well, an ace is betting itself. So I don't need to overbet against that. And then it's whether he calls or not, I don't care because I will find the bluffs. I can take my jack nine or something like that and just check-raise bluff. So yeah, definitely checking. I'm checking my 10x, I'm checking my 9x, and then against that size. Actually, it's very, very close to check-raise in the solver, but I think in reality it's not. Boom, we get the ace five to call. See you later. Very, very important to have that. I just want to show you this hand because it's just the definition of cornerstones of my range. You know you have that hand. That's freaking, well, not nine combinations because you three bet that quite high frequency, but at least some that you know you do that. 10 do suited, probably the same thing. All right. So let's just look that up in the solver as well to confirm that, that this is not just a random theory, but this is actually proven. All right. So check, villain is allowed to bet high frequency. We call our 10-9 all day long, obviously. Check raising, not a great option. We turn the 10 of spades, make it big again. Goes check, check, villain's ace five. Check, obviously very, very good. Overbetting is his choice in in yeah standard as a standard and the river i don't know the suits i don't care we'll have a look at our 10-9 and we have multiple options 10-9 is high frequency check block betting is fine as well mainly the reason is that villain is raising ace jack and ace queen still for value so it's a block bet call i think this is not happening the thin value raises i'm not seeing them and the bluffs villain bluff raising six two seven two five two's not happening so i don't like the block bet here i do that with like king maybe or weak aces myself and i prefer the check raise a lot here right it's more likely that i give up on that ace starts bluffing again than bluffing against a block bet just like what i expect and that against a check every ace bets is pretty certain so once they bet the question is now how protected is villain i think not too much you see this is one of the very very thin raises it's easy to add like a random nine or random 10 as a raise as well so just raising that him calling a random catcher it's just very very likely all right so second hand yeah i know it's very very tough but it's just this is why i want to remind you over and over again and i especially want to make it sound easy right it's just make it simple things right make it know your sizings that you use no rocket science here every hand i played here today was very very predictable i would say and then try to evaluate your hands use those principles right even villain with his ace five here just say like it's an zero ev catcher i can call i can fold it's both fine right and then feel free to fold more often than not so yeah very very easy hand in the end but still shows something and then coming to the last example not the widest ranges since it's a three bet pot, but still a cool one. Absolutely, Yachu, perfect. We would change from check raise to overbet river if we think villain is passive and like to show his weak ace-ex. Yes, mandatory overbet then. Exactly, that's it. Villain is not doing anything, we take over the job. That's it. All right, pocket tens, NL5K, Hungarian wreck, three bets from the small blind. We call, we flop a freaking set because I like to show winning hands and villain bets pot. I don't have the Kahoot question for here. I have a Kahoot question, but yeah, you answer both. Okay. Let's answer the Kahoot question. Villain bets pot in that three bet pot, queen 10, seven rainbow. You tell me, you answer the Kahoot question, and you write in the chat the hand he's having, okay? So the Kahoot question is very, very easy. Tucker, two. Let's go, Thomas. Last chance. True or false? Villain sizing is likely value-heavy. Is that true or is that false? And you can guess his hand in the chat. Kings, kings, kings, kings, kings, aces. Let's go. All right. So we all agree on this being value heavy and I agree so as well. Oh, we got the podium already. And then talk that hand through and have, look it up in the solver as well. So congrats Tucker. Good job. Easy one. And now again, what do you think I did? In the chat, one fourfold, two four, now you just jam whatever. Not just jam, jam, jam, jam, jam, jam, all in. Okay, so I can tell you I would have jammed on NL200, but on 5k I still give people some credit. Probably wrong, but I only called because this is the perfect hand that still gets it in on any turn and yeah so i i only did call got the worst turn that is there in the deck for me villain checked and i was like did i finally find a bluff here uh i put him on kings this is why i didn't use the small solver sizing and i just went half pot here because i just put him on Kings as you did. And we got the check jam and do not see Kings, but the freaking pocket sevens. So yeah, pretty fancy one on 200. You would have seen me jamming very, very certainly. And now let's just have a look. Where did he make a mistake? Maybe that's the perfect sizing. Maybe he played it perfectly and I didn't. And this is now what we want to see here. Small blind versus cutoff. This is the sim I offered a quarter pot sizing, half pot sizing, and the pot bet sizing. And yeah, you see like mainly betting small, but the pocket sevens definitely fine to just bet pot. Kings definitely fine to bet pot. And this is again the frequency mistake. Aces fine to bet pot. But do we see the 10% ace king, 10% ace king offsuit, 5% ace jack, 10% king jack? I mean, if we run that a little longer, that didn't run forever, frequencies might change. Do we see the king nine suited? Do we see the 10-9 using the blocker sometimes to just bet pot? I'm saying this is a zero, this is a zero, this is a zero, this is a zero, this is a zero, this is a zero. And then this is why we end up really playing versus hands. And if we just play versus hands, I mean, we see here just jamming is ridiculous, but if villain doesn't have a hand that is ever falling, well, and we just jam and he calls off his Kings as he is supposed to, he will look up his hand. He thinks he plays it perfectly. And what is even more important that, yeah, how do we answer that pot bet? Well, with massive overflowing. I'm not calling king-queen offsuit or king-queen suited, doesn't matter, right? We see that this is actually correct. And Willem's range here contains bluffs. I'm not calling ace-king. Why should I? I'm not calling ace-jack with a backdoor. Why should I? I'm not calling ace king why should i i'm not calling ace jack with the backdoor why should i i'm not calling a 10 that wins 16 in the solar world in a 1900 pot this is just something where we really have seen the sizing triggered by hand just make sure to get it in get maximum out of king jack whatever i'm probably calling king jack this is a nice hand to play and then fade then yeah this is the feeling now i have to whine a little like feeling is we have king jack of diamonds turn is the six of diamonds and then we face the jam and hate our life but yeah that's okay yeah another example where we really see very very likely sizing triggered by hand and this is how we can still work with a solver on the very exploitative side just seeing yes it's okay it's okay. He will review his hand and say he played perfectly, but it's very likely that he forgot this frequency, this frequency, this frequency, and this frequency. And yeah, this is what I want to implement, just like hammer in your heads. We can use the solver, but still have to mainly use our brain and just think about what is happening here. Frequency mistakes, hand choice mistakes. All right. Feel free to ask last questions. If not, I'm coming here with a river play. Lookalike principle. We got that. Number six, sure, sir. Right. Sizing triggered by hand and acts exploitative. This is how we want to act here. I would have jammed on 200. It's so stupid, but I would have. And this is what I want to be ready. And really, this is the sure, sir. I just meant really, I love having that overconfidence on the table. It makes your life easier. But even if it's wrong sometimes and people are playing perfectly and fine against you, that's okay, right? Give them credit. Like the guy with his seven in the first hand today. But really, it makes your life easier. as you did in the chat put him on kings and fold your ace queen it's more likely it's it's correct than not all right takeaways two things i split up into action game and reaction game action game here is really keep things simple choose the sizings you want to allow yourself first then think think about the hand. Yesterday, I played one hand against a student of mine, actually. And I had to flame him in Skype a second later. I haven't seen his hand. I've just seen his sizing. And then he told me, yes, he was lost and wasn't sure what to do against me. And then all of a sudden, he used a sizing that just doesn't exist and is not even one of his hotkeys and i'm like you just like heard the very first principle just make it yourself easy right use this or that sizing whatever just don't open up a new thing and try to outsmart me or something right if you don't have a clue right if you're perfect in that spot try that perfect right so choose your sizing options first and mainly know the cornerstones of your range. Everything is way easier. You know when to overfold, you know when you're protected, et cetera. To prevent that use against yourself, you do your best to keep your range together on queen 10-7 example. Yes, I cut it down. I don't play with three options and one of them is saying like 15% pot bet. I'm using one option, maximum two options. And I tried to have bluffs there as well. Do you take on new students? Not right now. No, since I'm just moving to Vienna now and tackling high stakes myself again, I don't have lots of time. So yeah, poker code on my students. Okay. So this is the action game. Really try to make it simple. This just helps you so much. Really think, speak it out loud. I'm using a block bet and a 75% bet here. Nothing else. Oh, my hand wants to do this. Let's go. And if that is wrong, that's fine. We learn from it. Now come to the reaction game. That's obviously very different. And another typo here. Whoa, that was a rush in the last 10 minutes. So yeah, make sure, remember my six, four of diamonds. Evaluate all streets. There's information in all the streets. Will it check back king 10-4 and now he represents a turned flush or boat? I don't believe a shit, right? He has a mid-pair with a blocker. Let's snap him off. Try to spot those typical mistakes. Frequency mistakes, hand choice mistakes, sizing triggered by hand. And there was one more in the beginning. Just look it up again. I forgot. So they are very, very typical mistakes. And by just knowing what would be right, it's easy to spot the potential mistakes. First hand, I'm still super happy how I called my fives there. Because I think it's very likely that the majority is not jamming a single, like a naked seven there that made a straight. I thought it's just like flush and bluff. And then I had certain reasons to think why it's potentially over bluffing with all the offsuit combos that get there. Have your cornerstones in the reaction game but be ready to exploit to the maximum. And as was Camille said I guess or who was it if villain is too scared with his weak top pair on the river instead of check raising we go crazy we overbet right even though this is not a solid play at all. But yeah, this is what I mean with be ready to explore to the river. Instead of check raising, we go crazy. We overbet, right? Even though this is not a solver play at all. But yeah, this is what I mean with be ready to exploit to the max. All right, guys, that's it. Almost in time. We would need an inventory. I gave you four already. Some you need to find out yourself. All right. Yeah, have a good day, guys. And that's it, I guess. See you around. The cash game channels are a little quiet right now. I don't know. Put the hands in the air. I'm screening through them, not seeing too much. So cash game channels are a little quiet right now. I don't know. Put the hands in there. I'm screening through them, not seeing too much. So feel free to post a little more there. Get the discussions going. This is how we all together get better. And I hope you liked it. I'll open a feedback thread there. Feel free to leave me feedback there as well. And then congrats to everyone who made the top spots in the Kahoot. And yeah, until the next one. Bye bye.
