### TOPIC: cash hand review 20
 All right, today's video is about collecting reeds. What I want to do is really dig a little deeper than usual. So I joined three tables of NL10. Should secure us to see plenty of mistakes in the standard gameplay or just like non-optimal play. What we try to do is really evaluate every showdown we see to get reeds from that. This will be a two-part series to then follow up with looking things up in GTO Wizard and understand those potential leaks that will lead to how we can exploit that. Like sometimes I will in-game get a feeling that this might mean this or that but this will be way easier to back up with GTO Wizard to then show like what hands are maybe missing, what are people not like balancing and then to figure out what that leads to. So really following that concept, just double checking what would be right. Secondly, what villains are doing wrong or potentially and then figuring out what is the right exploit. So now he should have obviously Broadway cards, quite some pocket pairs, not pocket threes too often. So actually I'm fine starting with biggish sizing here, folding out lots of his high cards and then on the correct cards. Keep going against his pocket sevens, pocket eights, just like important that he doesn't hit many sets there. Jack ten of clubs, obviously, I mean, not a great hand, but I don't expect to get zero calls here. All right, so the fourth slot is reserved for the replayer. I will miss lots of showdowns. So sometimes I'll just click through here. Off the hands, I'm not involved. I try to pay attention. So this is why I got a little coffee here. King seven off is one pip too wide. But I'll argue with postflop edge to make that profitable. And yeah, just want to get into more spots here. King of spades. I think it's fine to put out a small bet here and keep the aggression seven of hearts two okayish cards with that board so we can invest some money see is there anyone who is on two tables just some first thing to check this guy i mark green just because he plays 78 big wines only so very likely not a regular this guy prof lord probably the same and we go from there top right obviously having position on someone with 700 big blinds as strong like sometimes one thing to to look out for is that he might be like a little good run biased right that like everything works maybe chasing draws too much like he called that squeeze where every pocket pair will be indifferent and so on maybe he makes the close Euro calls just because the last five Euro calls went his way. He makes the big bluffs maybe just because the last five bluffs work. Just like small things that this is an emotional game, especially on NL10, where people don't have the very, very good fundamentals. This might be the case, obviously might be wrong, but it's just more likely for someone sitting there with 700 big blinds than it is for someone sitting there with 100. And I know that myself, sitting there with 500 big blinds than it is for someone sitting there with 100 and i know that myself sitting there with 500 big blind stacks on zoom 500 back in the days i was splashing around because it felt great and everything worked out all right we might see a showdown here oh let's say let's first play our king jack here go with a small c-pad king jack high call against jack 10 high call here we go let's double check on that one in a second he check raises all righty we got a call playing normal so far nine is a good card for us he's not check raising much nine x so all his straight draws just got way weaker we do have nine x obviously you can still have pocket threes or jack nine but jack nine suited is out of here and i think stabbing this one his straight draws have quite some equity against me might have an over card as well with the Queen-10 the King-10 obviously I'm happy to hit a King and we get it through alright so now here this is gonna be a three bet and while playing a Jack-10 suited we double check on that hand so we have a check haul by King-Jack and Jack-10 i think with the diamond start stabbing check check on this card bad card so he can do that has to check lots of queen x if he has queen 10 queen jack it's a good one to check back as well and then the king jack call down yeah an interesting one i just like blocking queen and unblocking diamonds like maybe you shouldn't bluff the diamonds there but yeah jack ten of spades on this board i'm just calling against aggression i want to shut down a little lots of people just play their two pair like that and that's it all right so tough to say what is a mistake here i think you don't want to have a jack right it's like that like any a7 is the better call i would say but yeah that he goes for that bluff stabbing flop is fine checking turn is fine trying river I think is fine will be mixed so nothing nothing to worry about here this year maybe is a potential mistake we can look that up Jack 10 of spades big one versus button open raising this year right so I see that just like having a raising range if we look that up in Gto wizard and we will do that later on you should see a very very narrow raising range right maybe some ace queen some pocket threes or like lots of pocket threes some pocket sixes the two pairs are usually not really raising just like my bluffs do not have any equity so he wants to keep them in and i'm definitely barreling on lots of cards here and wow what is happening here small line flat Small line lead. Unfortunately, we cannot solve that later I think it actually is okay on that board But like half pot into two absolutely uncapped ranges all of us have like Queen 10 and so on I'm just freaking fast playing here the super nuts definitely connects with that board. You're not doing that without anything I beat that so it's pretty clear what's going on i'm not scared of any sets so i just keep going actually sizing down maybe not directional in necessarily because i want to keep his queen jack jack 10 and so on in that are drawing to like a second best hand but interesting like just having that donk is a tell yeah we can look up the spot heads up just forget about the big blind so actually i write down the queen 10 off button versus small wind yeah i'm going for a seat here as well just have a look is there dunking how should their flatting range should look like and how easy it is for me to just react to that two dollar bet nine ten five six six seven eight x not the spot against the green tag i'm not bluff catching and i'm not turning that into a bluff here a little bit so but we were talking about the jack ten of spades that just it's likely that people deviate into one direction here because it's such a narrow range right finding correct bluffs well some people just do it with random shit like a king five hearts or like whatever and they will be over bluffing incredibly and people who just see a set and go like i mean this was very, very likely that he just has a two pair, I would say, or a pocket threes and then just like rips it. Doesn't exist. So this is enough for like a green tag. Like just this jam cannot exist. And yeah, just saying he probably, probably just fast plays the hands he has. So maybe we get some backup for that. Open race ace king. Okay. I expected like with my kind of tiny read or idea that he even bets that board i mean it's it's a board you should check a lot on but he has ace king check call check call and check check okay no more reads on that that's well played i think he can go for a third barrel but yeah he's king absolutely fine let's play our kings here top set obviously a small c bet betting range range on that board so this is fair enough ace deuce of spades right this is the fast play was more looking for the pocket tens but that's fair enough well done good job right it's like okay just putting in money this is a very typical thing for low stakes that people just don't want to play and they are happy about a hand they can just put their money in with and then hope for the best like the problem is he gives me very very very very very very easy decisions yeah what that means in the end is as well that if he only calls he will have way too many medium strong hands that i can just barrel him off a lot even when spades come and so on if i know something like that i need to speak it out right that this is a clear mistake to just check jam it i mean the call pre-flop against the three bet is already a mistake and just check jamming. It's so obvious that it's horrible, but maybe some beginners are watching as well. Just ripping in a nut flush draw is not good, even though it's obviously plus a beat. It's obviously plus a beat, but kills your whole range play. It's not a good risk reward. I'm only calling. He's always behind. Calling when I have it and the fold equity for his price won't be enough to make it a better play than the call or smaller check race now let's have a look whether i missed some showdowns on the other tables always focus on i had quite some hands to play now okay here ace four let's have a look at this one queen jack queen jack open ace four suited calls check check check check check down queen jack from under the gun so this is a non-bluffing knit obviously you cannot check down like queen jack high on king deuce three when you come from under the gun absolutely not possible like we won't pay a shit against this guy and we gotta re-tag him to my what is the brown knit note maybe this. Maybe this starts pre-flop 30 hands, 13, 10, zero. He's just betting his hand, playing his hand. That makes a lot of, lot of sense. Those stats don't tell us much, but this one hand tells us a lot, right? So now what I wanna look up is my eight, five diamonds, not involved hand, just that I find it, eight, five diamonds cut off. And we can look that up to then see how much money he's leaving on the table by not bluffing right how profitable would a bluff be with this hand on the flop i think the check back on the flop is fine but then on the river with queen high on that board he just doesn't have weaker hands villain needs to fold lots of stuff how profitable will it be and we will have a number in big blinds i mean will we point something not like a couple of big blinds but of this 4.3 big blind just because of the situation i would guess like 0.3 or 0.4 big blinds belong to him for the bluff because big blind is so weak that he needs to overfold this is just what he's not taking and this is where we we end up making money just like without doing anything right i mean not me in this case, but big blind right it's a little present to the big blind not taking that that he doesn't need to make a zero ev decision right will be super easy if he pays attention that he will never check all that ace four on the river now okay so three hands so far i mean here 50 big blinds ace eight offsuit i mean this is obviously happens here oh limp three bad limp call wow okay I thought it's like preflop all in. Two big blinds. Two big blinds ace-8 offsuit. I mean this is obviously what happens here. Limb, 3-bet, limp call. Wow, okay. So I thought it's like preflop all-in. Two big blinds, two big blinds. Okay, this is... wow. 11 big blinds and now raising. Wow, wow, wow. Super trappy with his super nuts. Another typical thing, inrollable nuts, size down. So quad jacks here. This is just like tiny milk batting with super nuts all right so there was a little call in between some interference here was it check check check check check i only called check down 1850 and this is exactly the spot like like the queen jack guy i've seen it that they are not bluffing i mean just checking back in the first place i just can't fold it's not possible but we will look into pocket tens now it's so obvious those queen four four check backs so yeah this is now if we see that two three times we can really make those ridiculous folds ridiculous folds we can look it up later ace shouldn shouldn't be zero eb there right probably i don't know whether he can value that is high it should be close but yeah and maybe look up the hand i played here while i was on the on the phone obviously binking it here where this will be interesting as well i open race small blind flat this squeeze right is this guy playing a real squeezing range i absolutely doubt it but still pocket nines just seem too strong but i don't mind folding this spot against someone like what i've seen here that people won't find there i don't know what like kind of bluffs that we do well against then obviously i bink it and he see that's big half pot big alarm bells going on right now right if we have more reads we can even fast play here before the eight of spades come out just because that half pot continuation here are people doing that with ace king lots of people are not right so just that one hand doesn't tell much now he's checking after a big bet so this is either a give up or a check jam so i size down and don't even go 25 just to to tickle his his ups a little more. Jack jam comes and he obviously like never ever ever has like a king 10 of spades here. Just like no not freaking happening. Yeah it's just always those two like exactly the hand that wants to go big on that flop and so on. Just like playing one hand and we will see that that obviously he played it fine. If we look it up in Pio it's absolutely fine what he did but the rest of his range how will he play that and is this a real range or can we just put him on jacks all the time and actually easily fold like ace nine suited or pocket tens that we might play the same way until the turn that just like this gives us options gives us options put that down in the editor now the nines versus jacks our ace king big line versus tens under the gun and now we're half five hands check all here my king queen you're obviously paulana pete won't be a great player smallish smallish can be anything but i'm not going crazy with that here this can again like be some some boat that wants to keep the flush draws in so i'm not going crazy here with like floats and so on people are so weak when it comes to betting from what i've seen so far making love catches and chasing draws when we're it's not to the nuts this is not what i'm here for right early decisions and really understanding how how people play has to be the key on those sticks all right ace 10 maybe we get one more nice showdown against 3x from the cutoff obviously easy defend but already keeping in mind 3x usually means something some people are only using 3x some people size up when they want with their hand five big blinds now now our draw is to the nuts i think he always has something so i have more implied and when he checks back turn i think i won't bluff here i still i don't know anything about this guy so i play a reasonable cold four bet strategy that includes all ace queen suited but usually i don't love it too much so now bet big flop bet small now it doesn't make any any any any any any any sense like what should that be like strong value on the flop now not value anymore like i don't know right i mean my hand sucks will be a in theory like a mixed call price in here because he could be bluffing but this means something and obviously ace queen is pretty easy how should we go against king queen pocket jacks ace jack so let's do something like this i write down as 10 off big blind versus cut off 3x weird sizings we We can look that one up Well, definitely iso and queen check off here now, but if you run into tens, that's fine. We will call a check jam Now it looks like a tank fold Okay, ace king All right, let's write that down as well. Ace queen suited cold four versus ace king cool Very good. So that should be enough so nice little playing to get like seven eight nice showdowns that we can go through to really learn from those yeah we got them for two stacks here we go obviously binking a little with ace queen versus ace king i mean the moment it got in i felt good and with a set of nines all right hope you enjoyed it so far and you're thrilled as much as I am to have a deeper look at the hands and the potential mistakes we have seen on what they mean for our gameplay in the future.
