### TOPIC: cash hand review 21
 Here we are back in the mix now having a little look at GTO Wizards. So beautiful 23 minute session. I just recorded for just a bit over a hundred hands and we got a couple of hands that I think are interesting. Now we want to look that up. So let's start with the first. Here's my list. I can show that. I'll keep it on the side here. So we got the Jack, 10 of spades. Going through the hand quickly again. Jack, 10 of spades. I had three bet from the big blind should be super standard we get called i go with a small c-bet and he decides to race we can't see the sizing down here we can see the 1.75 so like re-axing my my bet here i call and then he jams the turn so we want to have a look at the flop racing range and we want to have a look at that turn jam just figuring out that this will hopefully clearly be wrong let's upload that hand just like my hand makes it pretty easy and fast all right so our three bet is super fine on the flop small but it prefers the big bet depends like how you want to play that board here that range in the solver includes lots of like king ten off suits and stuff like that which like that, which forces us to not bet that often. I play it a little differently, so I'm fine with that. We see the same EV. Villain raises, and we want to take a look at that. Ace-6-3. We see that this is not a small bet high-frequency board. It's more like sometimes a big, with our ace-king, ace-queen, make it a two-street game, maybe even. But jack-10 suited can obviously do anything it wants. Let's take the 20%. That's fine. And buttons raising range is the following. It's like not really, really existent. It's like not a real range. I call it usually because there's not a single hand that wants to do it more than 50% of the time, right? We see the pocket threes. They always want to raise, but they should fall to the three bet most of the time. And now the question is that we have to ask ourselves, it's a spot where this range doesn't really exist, right? If you mix everything perfectly together, you get to like a 7.3. This is like he did it 175 or like 17.5 if you look in the big blinds. So it's the correct sizing that he chose. But do we think he ever does that with pocket fours? Do we think he does it with pocket fives? Do we think he does it with sevens, with six seven, with seven eight of hearts? Maybe if he does that, he will be over bluffing because he won't be like the 20% here, 20% there. Or is it just the guy who has a flop two pair that actually shouldn't raise? This flop two pair just binked a set and doesn't go for like 30 40 percent raise but always does it that's the question right so now this is something to figure out where i think on low stakes it's just usually value value value that gets a little confirmed by this year where we clearly see on the turn an all-in just should not exist but someone going all in this in position is just i have it and i want this hand to be over because lots of cards hurt me so it smells a lot like ace three smells a lot like a six maybe something like that maybe even threes and sixes just want to get over it and actually give up on quite a lot here seven eight of diamonds seven eight of clubs like i highly doubt it so i mean i'm folding ace jack for sure ace queen ace king i might sometimes just re-raise because i'm still unsure this is here now against his race what we should be doing but i might just fold ace 10 against his race just like having some reads and population tendencies just understanding okay it's a very very narrow range that people are playing now he has shown us with that turn play that it was clearly clearly value like maybe the four or five spades once in a lifetime but not really like yeah very very certainly and this is something we can use all right second hand is queen 10 off or a button versus the small blind dog unfortunately we cannot model that so actually i replay it because it was three-handed but we can have a look how heads up should play out i open raise the button small blind flats and we just forget the big blind so we do it this way rig structure is not that important to me right now button small blind has a flatting range okay maybe we take lower rake actually this here should be lower rake and have some more small blind flats no this is a three bet only a sim general tough to find that flatting range really but okay that's so we have the nuts and now we got a jack of clubs nine of spades there's no solution for this spot doesn't have a meaningful range okay so now I put in the big blind here we go I want the big blind to call as well and we see okay donking does not really make sense just like the button has pocket eights pocket nines pocket jacks queen 10 offsuit queen 10 suited 10 7 suited king 10 king queen pocket aces pocket kings but whatever you do as a donk like it's a very very simple simple option to even donk bigger than that right if the small donk already doesn't exist which means you don't want to invest money it just clearly means that the big donk will not exist at all right so we have this here and this is our reaction right queen 10 we just raise it up and then okay we are now already in a non-existent game tree so everything we see here is just shit so whenever yeah you want to have a reason to donk right that you you have an advantage now his reason was probably he has a hand like jack 10 who knows something like that that connects with the board so i don't i bet this is how lots of recreationals are playing not understanding position not understanding ranges they look at their two cards they look at the board and if they have something they bet which at the same time is very good for us because when they are not betting well they will fold a lot if this guy decides to bet when he has a jack well every time he checks to us he well doesn't have a jack and will have increased fold equity so this is why c betting against players like that is even even more effective all right let's get to hand number three and hand number three is a one I was not involved in. So let's have a look at, I'm looking for eight five of diamonds here. And I talked about it in game, how big of a mistake that might be. Open raise from under the gun, rather loose. But when you're min raising, seems fine. Check, check, flop, check, check, turn. And you're from under the gun. Like there are no weaker hands. Like's it's impossible And I want to know how much money would this bluff make in a theory world Villain needs to be over folding with this big blind rage. Just no chance. He's not it's not a fair fight here This this needs to have forced over fold because it's impossible for in position to find enough bluffs to be honest So we'll have a look the under the gun race queen jack off. You can do it. It's close. Big blind call. Obviously ace four suited. Absolutely fine. We get a board of king of hearts, deuce of spades, three of diamonds. Big blind check. Super standard and under the gun. Can bet a lot. Queen jack. Obviously you can check it back as well. Okay. Same EV. We see a mix. So EV is the same. Right? So seven of diamonds. villain checks. Still lots of checking, range is so weak. Queen-jack next option to bluff. Obviously a little better to have diamonds than not, but we see something here, right? You have queen high. There's 4.5 big blinds in the middle and you see it here in absolute numbers that the EV of your queen-jack without the diamonds is still 1.5 big blinds. This is just how good your position is that forces villain to overfill. Let's have a look if you would bet 1.5 here. Let's just do the quick math. You risk 1.5 to win the 4.5 in the middle plus your 1.5 back. That means you need 25% fold equity. This is a good bet because villain's range is so weak, you have 50% fold equity or 49. All right. So this time it's check, check. The rubber is a four of diamonds. Not a great card for imposition, but still. Villain is checking to us. Queen, jack, offsuit. All right. So the check, you're still sometimes winning because big line needs to give up. So you still win like 1.17 big lines. I didn't mention that, that you're obviously can can be winning with queen jack. But I was talking about the upside of the bluff, right? Like how much EV you make. So it's like 0.3, 0.4 more, which I'm happy to see that it's about that. It's almost 0.5. So just not bluffing here is leaving half a big blind on the table. And I'm talking about like a villain that plays perfectly, right? That's not just over over folding or anything. If villain calls ace jack, if he calls ace queen half of the time, still you are making this money. All right. So this is something just winning half a big blind. This happening every hundred hands. Well, half of a big blind win rate is already out there, right? So just like those small mistakes, this is what makes you money without you really doing anything correct and big decisions or so on people make those mistakes all right so half a big blind not taken here by hello world 93 alex64 says thank you well even though this hand would be a theory check call who knows pocket nines versus pocket jacks as the next one let's have a look at the hand quickly again ended up winning a stack i open raise small line flats big blind squeeze let's start at that point right so button raises small line calls big blind three back let's have a look at that squeezing range okay he squeezed to 13 that should make it slightly tighter but this is a lot do you guys think that on nl10 the average big blind that you have never seen before ever squeezes queen 10 offsuit? King 10 offsuit? King jack offsuit? Queen jack offsuit? Jack 8 suited? King 5 suited? My answer is no. Very strong no with an absolute 0%. So he squeezes my hand. It's very easy. Nines. Just because of that different range, my nines here feel more like pocket fours, to be honest like as if it's like 0 EV and I'm set mining I put in some post-batch that they probably misplay their ace Kings and don't put in the correct bluffing ways that I sniff them out A little and just like call a small bet and check down and attack the right boards and get a little more value of hands Like that, but who knows? Alright, so it feels very very close. Okay, so I call small one folds and we have a game on nine of spades good card seven of clubs and the deuce of spades and now what do we see villain should bet big here he should do that with jacks most of the time and now the question is this is the hand he looks it up oh i played perfectly i ran into the set well he did in this hand absolutely but would I have paid off his jacks ever if it was like eight, seven deuce? I'm folding flop versus half pot. I tell you that. Just because what am I playing against? What do I try to play against? His bluffing part. King-jack offsuit, queen-jack offsuit, king-ten offsuit, queen-ten offsuit, king-ten suited, this, this, this. I'm saying all that. I just highly doubt that that exists, right? I just make it like this. He bets half pot. My pocket nines in theory win seven big blinds. Let's say I have it without the spades, then we are winning like six big blinds. I think it's a flop fold against most, most, most players just for those reasons, right? Just every time you see them call the hands they should be squeezing a high frequency, you can make it tick. Like just sitting here for one hour is enough to see those stats probably that this is not happening all right so he polarizes i put him on value or bluff but i think the bluffs didn't start pre-flop and now we get to the turn nine seven deuce and the turn is another deuce beautiful he well checks now so it's either a give up or like pocket queens pocket aces whatever and i was exactly doing this size down to 20 instead of this year this i don't need any protection i want to tickle him a little maybe make something stupid and now again we see his range he should check jam pocket jacks again he played it perfectly this hand i just think his range was absolutely messed up because, do you think he's ever jamming queen ten of spades? Queen jack of spades? Jack ten of clubs? I don't think so. Ten six of spades? I mean here it's a smaller check raise as an option as well, but if I sit here with pocket tens, I don't think he has ace nine or king nine, which well these are kind of value hands that that I beat But if he check jams here pocket tens win 90 big blinds and I think it's a hell of a good fold Well, it's like they win against value in theory against most players. I think it's a hell of a good fault now Maybe without reads I'm not going that far and just say like 10 9 suited is a great fold pre flop All right So really we can adjust a lot with some ideas and now i don't want to present like that i know how people are playing but just you double check yourself is this happening what should be happening if not you've got to adjust your whole post-flop game all right and i have a clear opinion on that and was happy to share that with you let's go to the next one ace king big blind versus tense under the guns under the gun. So under the gun did open raise, he looked nitty on the first hands, so I decided to only call ace-king off-suit here in the big blind, which is kind of standard anyways. And the board, let's find the exact hand. Oh actually I missed that, that one player was on sit-out, so we make it the real one, we make it hijack, hijack raises, steal my big blind, sometimes just calling ace-king. I thought it's under the gun in game. And the board is queen of diamonds, four of hearts, four of spades. Check. And now villain checks back. This is correct because I can have more forex check raise a lot that he checks back a lot. But now the question is, I put villain on pocket tens. I speak it out loud on the river. Actually, I had pocket jacks first in mind, but I didn't want to say the obvious, right? The pocket pair under the high card that just wants to check back. The question is, is he checking back ace queen as well? I'm saying no. Is he checking back aces as well? I'm saying no. Is he checking back 10-9 suited on a board like that? I'm saying no, right? So here, I love check raising a lot because people are just betting everything on a dry board, not understanding that 4x is a huge advantage for me at the same time I'm see betting a lot way more than that on the board as well because I say people are not check raising enough on that Board, right? So it's like lots of assumptions, right? But here we see a total of 12 15 percent check raising ace 5 offsuit. Let's freaking go All right, so this is not happening okay it goes check check and the turn is a three of spades my ace king will be a rather clear check huh we polarize a little to the four check villain checks back again okay ace jack ace 10 those might be the case ace 10 ace 9 with the plan of checking down but checking back eight nine again as a pure give up on a board like that. I highly doubt it That's a check check and river is now a four Absolute freaking break so villain is winning with ace jack ace 10 ace 9 pretty much all the time My ace King is close to being a value bet against that only ace high pretty much, right? So it's like we're chopping so he bets now and he is betting not ace high So he's betting Pierce and bluffs, the question is now, does he have enough bluffs that I need to catch anything? What did he bet? Half pot. Let's take the 78%. Half pot doesn't exist, but then we have an actual range. And here, interestingly, ace king goes for a race. That's cool. Locking king, queen, ace queen. Just playing a queen like that. I didn't think about that against half pot. I love it now. Actually, now I want to do it in game because if i say he has pocket tens i want to do that but all the ace highs are like that right ace king would be a plus ev call as well or like zero ev call yeah i just think that all those bluff catchers lose and that got a little backed up by him having pocket tens that's kind of the idea to understand how are people playing certain hands people like to live easy lives. Queen for four, c-bet, take the pot down with eight nine suited is an easy life. This is what people go for. And this means that you can fold all those bluff catchers. You end up folding not 73%, which would be correct, you end up folding freaking 90%, which is absolutely fine. All right. At the same time, you probably don't want to check your ace-queen, king-queen to go for the check-raise because you're not getting the value from villain bluffing. So you rather focus to choose a sizing yourself against 10s and jacks that are just probably never folding, right? If we have king-queen, you're actually overbetting here or like big betting, slight overbet, you can choose that and villain sits there and hates his life with jacks, 10s, and I'm saying he almost has those hands 100% of the time because it's just the very natural way to play that okay let's go to the next one ace 10 offsuit big blind versus cutoff this will be a little mess because villain did 3x pre-flop which shouldn't be the case right it just pretends that villain did open raise 2.3x my call is super clear my check call on the flop is super clear against that big size but it's 0.05 once we have the read that he is freaking not bluffing and i think that read we can just have without knowing this guy it's a fold so i talked about okay we have nut outs the queen might hit him so i give myself more implies than i should have on hitting the queen but that's about it i don't mind folding give up those five cents villain should have some ace five of hearts here and give up some turns and here against the small sizing on the turn which we'll figure out that that does not really exist yeah it says like you see it's a non-existent game tree already because it says call 60% of the time but it has minus 2.95 eb that doesn't fit together so we got lost in the game tree here because yeah i can tell you this small not exist. I don't know what it means. It can be something like I have a set and don't want villain go away. It's like first he's going with absolute strength and a big size makes sense. You're on the board with something like exactly aces, ace king and so on. But the turn is an absolute freaking brick after betting big on the flop. And then you still want to get lots of value and now you size down. Like it's like special stuff going on and special stuff going on is always dangerous right why should someone just invent now i have a crazy bluff i go super huge on that flop now i get no no it's people have something like oh i have pocket kings let's charge all his draws let's keep them in on the turn like i don't know so whenever something is weird it's a little on the value side when he didn't get pushed into this situation Like when something happens on the river where he just can't have it It can obviously be like super weird bluff bullshit as well. But here it just doesn't fit together I mean my hand kind of plays itself, but I would have followed any King on the turn against the small size as well To be honest, okay So ace Queen suited our cold for it next stack win as the last hand. So, we got a cold 4 bet. 91% of the time, I'm playing without a cold calling range. So, it is 100%. And it makes me 0.37 big blinds. Small blind did 3 bet against the hijack. But it was against the hijack 3x, which makes the small blind stronger. And the fact that we are on NL10 makes the small blind stronger as well. actually I think that 0.37 is actually too high I'm not sure whether like if I know him better whether I should just let this one go obviously villain just calling ace king let's have a look at the game tree helps me a lot yeah I need to play ace queen versus ace king but it just means I realize equity so big blind raises and this is small blind's answer and ace king is a mix, right? But if he ends up calling there, it's more like I don't expect people to be mixing It's like the last 10 times he was playing against nuts only so he just calls to be safe Who knows maybe hit something so on the flop I can range bet this small or this small I decide to go for this. Villain should sometimes raise his ace king as a bluff That's not happening on l10 definitely not call and the turn is that ace and village should actually don't not happening i keep betting my ace queen suited actually i should check sometimes for the reason that villain then ends up bluffing something let's take this here uh the villain can add something like seven eight suited as love seven six suited who knows pocket jacks did fold on the flop yeah i can check that back i think it's way better to just keep batting and just people have ace jack suited people have a king queen suited people have ace king and yeah against my bet i'm not sure whether his jam is actually fine i think it's a little too loose you see like obviously not a value jam we have 72 big blinds in the middle and he wins seven by calling or jamming it's just the best play before anything else is happening right here 36 i bet bigger and now it's either a jam or a fold like i bet something in between i bet like 35 so we can look at both and see like comp here yeah he has top pair top kicker but actually he's never good in that spot because what are my bluffs that he wins again if i then fold i don't have king 10 suited i don't have ace 10 suited i don't have ace jack that he wins against i don't have ace five that's kind of his problem just because that everything started a little tighter so yeah that was nice i mean don't want to say his stack office is not good or bad or whatever the range is how they actually played how things are tighter is changing stuff all right how in general to approach that after just seeing i played 20 minutes only and just seeing that is that it was very very easy to put people on hands and this is just because people are not really mixing or anything they look down at their hand they decide their action they want to do something and they usually try to like they want you to fold they want you to call they want to just have a cheap bluff and so on and that makes it very very easy to adjust right i think the pocket jacks versus pocket nines even though it was perfectly played hand by both players more or less i think it's the best example where we just see like ranges will be absolutely off and we can have incredible adjustments queen jack no bluff from under the gun shows like where money is made in all the small pots against like weak players on small limits and this is just where your win rate comes from it's not the miracle super bluff check raise river it is stuff like that every orbit every freaking orbit every small hand you're playing all right hope you enjoyed that type of video and see you for the next one
