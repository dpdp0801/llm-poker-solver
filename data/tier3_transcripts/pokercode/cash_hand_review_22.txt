### TOPIC: cash hand review 22
 All right, guys, playing a little new format. What I'm playing here is NL10, four tables, normal tables, no zoom. So really, I want to show you how we can guide through something like that. Trying to get reads, really playing against unknowns as probably an unknown. I don't know how known my name is to random players in NL10. So I treat myself as an unknown as well. Using the HUD to just see the first BPI piece after a couple of hands normal tables not zoom should be very interesting i'll have a look how things go probably some sizing adjustments try to get involved in as many pots as possible that's important to me this is where that six five suited flat comes from and whenever we see a showdown actually that's will be tough with four tables but whenever we see a showdown, I'll try to learn from that. So here pocket jacks, ace queen nine. Not interesting. Okay, he went for the bluff catch on the river. Good or not, right? I had nothing. It's fine. I check back low aces and bet them on the river. Same way. So who knows? I bet my nut blow. Doesn't tell us anything. So nothing to write down or to keep track of. Gaining reads means going through our three questions, knowing what would be right. I most players here i should have an edge knowing what is right then figuring out what villain is doing wrong this is what we are talking about right now and then maybe talk about the right exploits right away i know that there will be mistakes from nl10 players but that is just why i adjust with trying to get in the mix more often than against very good players on higher stakes so pocket pocket deuces, for example, I will flat every pocket pair that I don't want to three bet. We have a non-full stack behind that I'm probably very happy to play with. Not a set here, but still probably making some more money with my sets. Maybe some spots where I can make money without a set. This might be one of those if he checks, actually. Because something I expect here is really that people are betting when they have it. So we have seen the guy on A-screen something to check pocket jacks, which is totally fine. But here that I can run multiple barrel bluffs with something like deuces, that he will check a jack and fold at some point. Maybe one call, maybe two, and so on. I don't expect him to check all pocket jacks to have like check raises later and so on. So yeah, pocket fives against 3x. I'm just folding on jacks. I try to play lower variance, so 6-7 suited. I will never 3-bet here actually against the 3x and just get many decisions. Queen-8 suited, I'll put in a flat here as well. This here will be a call against half pot. Check, check. I think just too many snap calls on his side to turn this into a bluff. Jack-8 is busted. Bates, I can win against the king is just a horrible card for me and ace nine is absolutely fine so all right so now something we can write down is here getting ace nine on 10 9 6 that tells me okay we can check raise a little more right to use not ace 9 6 but 10 9 6 right the second pair to use like somewhat biggish sizing with half pot it's not the standard click c-bet with a small sizing maybe he thought about it a lot and takes his best second pairs to cover trips on the turn when the nine hits but probably just yeah something and this is standard c-bet sizing and so on first thing where maybe the showdown is slightly interesting and yeah this is something that we can attack with aggression again a hand that will maybe is's not necessarily a big part of the c betting range in theory that will fold at lots of runouts all right so we have seen stack death if runs one here from austria with 80 big blinds probably recreational the guy with the scottish flag here with queen seven off blasting off 40 big blinds i didn't really pay attention let's double check that hand in a second interesting to figure out stuff open race call queen seven are very loose small bet call over bet call with a naked queen is absolutely horrible obviously river he goes into check call mode over betting with king jack on that straight run out i mean it's okay but not really what you want to do i think against weaker players it gets better so he did a good job here and then he goes for the manual sizing bluff. Cool I'm chasing my open ender here nothing else and this year I'm actually isolating limper and chases draws against all odds that's the queen seven. And now we do kind of the same thing like the guy with king jack lots of hands that are like pair plus draw against a weak limp call player. So I just size up here. I go pot. And now I don't, he can have nine, eight, but I bet exactly what I want against a King Jack, King, Queen, whatever. All right. So I think this can be like something like that. Really one thing that works very, very well here when you kind of have an idea how people are playing is put them on the hand you want them to have. Like if here King-10, my two pair, I was thinking about the King-Jacks, King-Queens that I have beat. Just choose a sizing to go for that. If I have a bluff, I might think about like depending on my bluff how good it is that I go for, do I try to fold out like some nut low, Do I try to fold out something strong? Just for the needs of my hand, that we are more playing hand versus hand than really range versus range because they won't be reacting that much to what I'm doing. That's kind of the assumption. Well, it's not really an assumption. We're playing NL10 with lots of recreationals that are just not studied in that poker way. This is why I go for a cutoff flat with a hand that just seems fine to flat 100 big blind steep and yeah it's actually tougher than i thought to pay attention here to all the showdowns i probably missed a couple when i'm not involved in the hands but yeah i think that's a good pace so far six seven i don't want to be too loose to start with here did we actually see the eight nine suited squeeze and a call so that queen jack suited call is very loose and he is not going for a range play. This was a small one for Cyn. Not going for a range play and just checks back because he has third pier and check check check down. So this is more like okay this is more the aggressive note and here after he checks back in the lip pot i think my queen is just always good against 80 big blinds tag i'll even go with my 6-8 suited and this guy i give a green tag which is usually like call happy call happy pre-flop just like a queen jack suited is not a call against a squeeze they're out of position i'm gonna put that down just expecting that if i three bet him for example i expect him to just have all pocket pairs for example that he just calls stuff like that and my ace king high here being good just showing the queen jack he's just like never bluffing the screen is just for like passive probably call happy as well players like that confirmed never bluffing if he's not bluffing that he's not bluffing anything low jack open limb queen jack offsuit so next a job for me is to figure out whether he has a raising range right this is what the hud is important for us so 50 0 over 12 hands doesn't tell us anything but like queen jack is exactly and there's just too weak to race so it fits into a limping range when you do both if he starts raising as well then i can really hammer on his limbs because it will be unprotected if he limbs everything i still need to be careful because then there might be aces kings queens in there and so on all right ace five ace five first and we're obviously playing in the small blind but not from under the gun he's for two pairs so something i want to look up as well if someone like this has a strong hand what is his bat sizing pattern put it bottom right limp Check check small bet pot all right so the river pot see that against the min race we are in with our queen queen eight suited i mean it's clear if someone is not bluffing and we have that like here the queen instead of checking back don't think i gain much from river bluffs way more likely he has like a jack something that connects with the board so i take one street now to check back later and this here really sucks because this is just a solid play and my queen eight is just call but not really a good good call and pocket fives were have a look check check he got pocket threes all right so this is blue this is just crazy calls and And this is nothing. And here pocket fives. Actually, I don't want to take over the initiative here by donking. And now obviously you can bet ace king and add bluffs. But it's tough to get the money in because like a check raise might scare him off. But he's never folding if I bet here. And he has ace king. Usually that's like a player type. So I don't know. Just guessing a little. It doesn't really make that much sense for my range. Let's check it. That just makes more sense. sense i mean both is fine in theory okay all right so i got quite some labels already and i'm definitely not seeing all the action queen seven i don't go crazy i want to have more hands where i know where i'm at so I might be too loose with my offsuit connectors suited hands 9-6 suited I don't go crazy against the 3-X either And yeah, here it's very loose open race just because of the big blind blue tag just means we want to freaking play Okay, check check half pot already not great, but I mean not folding an ace and now definitely not folding an ace I probably moved him off a chop just something I'm just very very sure that sizing is not protected that he never has anything better there than the split we just go for it here we're just calling to it well now a double gutter but yeah now again here smallish three bad queen-jack is actually indifferent that That could just fold, but again, give ourselves some postal bet. And we can make it profitable, hopefully. And that jack-10 against someone who check-called here. Don't try to move this guy off a king. So we're just checking. So this blue mark here is very important. Okay. He got the 7 and he calls a king against a crazy overbet. So yeah, cool. I I would have done the same with the freaking seven just go for it getting paid off It's obviously great insane station. That's what we want to see right in both ways I just make money here by not bluffing. I think I should be the one with the most 7x So I could be bluffing quite something. Use a small sizing rep some ace-axes. Well, but yeah, no just no here i'll write down uh bed size means hand strength right with the bed check over bed with trips same here this is not a high frequency race here because the board gets so ugly and we want to see that first in position and against we race we can't do a but this 30 percent here it's just it can be queen 10 right and i want to charge that stuff it can be a low flush draw i want to charge that stuff not not let him free roll instead of just calling a rather race now don't see any downside to be honest king deuce five seven not a race queen deuce of hearts is close but i'll give it a go all right so here this is again maybe if you attended the the community coachings regarding pre-flop like one of the first ones and the pre-flop advanced one we just had like a couple months ago this is what what i'm talking about here that i don't want to give you charts because here anything we know about the players where the ev comes from changes everything dramatically right with the gto wizard shows you plus or minus 0.02 doesn't when you have like, you might have like a plus, plus half a big blind or minus half a big blind in lots of post-flop spots. Just knowing what's going on, that is just worth way more. I'll just sizing to the, I want you to say anti in the middle, but someone posted and folded or like posted. I don't know where did those come from? And here that was button open race. I was not flatting the button. Someone was on on sit out i'll actually kind of turn that into bluff right away i can go with some six acts that go big right away on that board get called by draws and then fold them out later obviously lots of direct folds as well and this is one of the worst cards where i cannot go crazy now no equity whatsoever right like any offsuit four and his six just is a bink now villain has lots of nuts so we give up and maybe win against ace jack ace 10 every now and then king jack all right that's cool like him not betting the river just means a lot already right it's like he has the clearest block bet of all times which means he's never folding there the river so like i don't want to bet check bet bluff against people who are not value betting themselves so it's really something to be aware of okay he strong hands in his range. And we've got to be a little cautious there with our thin value bets. The exploit is we are happy to not face a bet. Realize full equity. And yeah, 10, nine suited not doing. It gets a three X and ace, 10. Oh shoot, I'm open raising. All right, four, nine suited. We need quite some post flow bets for that. But let's think positive. It's not an anti-table, right? It's always someone posting. But still, 7-2s won't make it. But queen-10 is fine. It's actually won against a small Y. That's a solid check back. If I bet here now, my outs might be dead, getting called by lots of king-X. Upside being like folding out queen-jack, and that's about it. Maybe ace-10. So this is something I'm going to delay that's a perfect card like if i check back queen and ten high i can have a jack as well yeah let's bet this one full out pocket force and against this guy who's never showing aggression and snap he had the check back button on so this is just something we know so he had the check back button on and i'm going just because of that i go for all of it like can have a clean he can have a random 10, but he's never sitting on anything good here this year eight. All right The four seven, okay Yeah, I go really really big just because he's not folding and this is just what ace King wants to do lowering SBR Okay, there's a line somewhere. There's a line but with ace king folding out something like deuce five suited is not that bad. 45 hands. 11-7. Actually, that is enough for me to go any two here. Small one first in. This is just not possible if you play like some proper stats. 4x. I mean, pocket deuce is still an easy call. This is enough to raise here because of that guy. And a big bet on the flop. We are out. Pocket Queens, all right. Mm-hmm. Looking on the side, whether I missed some more showdowns. I mean, I definitely did, but, like, some that I want to hook up together. Pocket Jacks against the small blind. That's the small blind. We got to check a lot here. Our flush draw, obviously obviously i'll go half pot to take the pocket pairs right away actually small is fine also plushie board checking down those pocket jacks and this two is that a weak ace like i don't find the bluffs like that to be honest i'm betting twice just against the pocket pairs but i'm not bluff catching jacks here flat. Maybe ace queen of diamonds, so I hope that he doesn't show up with pocket eights now. If he has a king, everything is good according to plan. I want him to fold sevens on the turn. All the pocket pairs, sevens, eights, nines, tens. And five, seven is a very strong hand and earns him this one. Cut uppers, button openers, call, seven, five suited. Check Check call, trips versus small bets. So this means passive and very call happy preflop. So he will lose a lot of money playing those hands. Six, three, we're out of here. I'll import a guy, I'll have to play with him. Four, six is not that horrible. Let's invest that half a big blind. Not bluffing, just not bluffing means not bluffing. Not at all. And here, clubs might might be dead so it's just a fold even though we have a flush draw in a straight draw but we want to hit hands that can value bet against someone who's just not folding we just have a clear image where the money is coming from think about that seven five suited guy he made trips right but if i hit my flush i will set him all in and like there's no way he's not gonna pay off and here i won't start any four bad shit i think it's closed call and if his range is too tight it actually makes it not worse to call that because my hand makes ace x which beats kings queens jacks and is happy when he doesn't three bad like a7 suited too often yeah it makes flushes which i'm happy to play against hands that pay me off then so actually the tighter his range is the more interesting my ace x suited gets slightly if he has all the king jack off suits my hand is not that cool see that realize equity not expecting many check raises even though he should have lots of them sand really gets hurt by a check race but yeah now now we can go slight slightly crazy with hijack actually i don't know whether he would sit out before that hand already or like that player left. Under the gun would be really good, but hijack is close. Alright, so interesting, right? We didn't hit any value hands. It's like we lost somewhere. We know, see clearly the mistakes. But if you grind it like that and you will get your spots playing the right hands, going for the right spots, and just not going for glory with big, big, big aggression and so on. It's like lots of small mistakes that add up. For example, that where we probably had the split, and I just randomly come from the, I have the stronger range, I could have some nuts, I just splash in 50 big blinds and absolute pre-roll. When like, I think like, what was it? Like three, four big blinds there. Like those spots come up just knowing, not making that bluff against the guy who calls. Iceling light against those, or like isolating lots of hands against those guys who just like are way too loose, playing in position in those spots. And then in the long run, we just, the cards will fall in a good way.
