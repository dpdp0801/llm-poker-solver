### TOPIC: cash hand review 23
 So here's small bet here. Actually, I'm going to check raise that small. Little heads up on the side here. So I did flat here, hit my set. He bets on a range check board. And on the turn, I have the super nuts and slow down a little just to keep him in with his nut flush draws. And now there is like only one answer. And we hope for the best. Pocket kings. And actually, like, we hope for the best. I want to end the sentence with him not having kings. But I think fair enough. Okay. Set on our set. Just a big mistake to bet your pocket kings here. And then like paying off the raises. To check. See what's going on. Then he gets money from bluffs as well. And can get away on the right runouts. So here. This guy was the 7-5 suited guy. So he's maybe too loose on the big blind as well. and we just have an easy range bet and go from there. Checking down, winning against 5x. Again, that thing that we have seen against a different guy, but on that same table, where they are just not value betting value bets. So you've got to be cautious with bet check bet lines for thin value and with bluffs, because they have lots of hands that should be long in betting ranges, jack i think should be a close to 100 betting hand end up in check call which just gives them a pretty pretty strong or pretty high check call frequency three bet ace king what are we going to do check obviously betting is also fine but i need them to understand that pocket eights nines need to fold at some point and here now I'm betting 10% I guess ace queen, ace jack that triggers people like this people really doing that with sixes, sevens, eights feel like I made something happen I'm gonna call that down no matter what I don't give a shit what's the nation read Germany yeah yeah yeah it's not necessarily those check check pocket eights that's good that's good it's like a check call in the end right my my small bet is like a check and he puts out a normal bet i think probably he would bet like smaller than that than his race but still i mean obviously i have six i have ten outs so i can't go anywhere anyways with the chance of bluffing and now yeah he didn't put me on like ace king if so he needs to value that river no matter the vector flush and here i'm going for a race and this year squeeze against someone who was aggressive that doesn't make it better for seven eight suited so actually i'm just folding not the spot where i tried to make money we are after value hands so far we didn't have many and that king jack against check race is not really a value hand anymore obviously we are priced in for now happily calling but like you can have easily queen 10 or 9x as well so it's really bad turn card checks again and i think pot betting that we're flush king jack okay that's a good card now i'm pretty sure we're winning this one this king so this is important right in those spots lots of people are already super super strong those 50 hands help me that this is like i can easily four bet against this guy just like i mean this is like 26 it's quite some of the three bets that we have seen king six suited let's go for it oh this guy i love it against more nitty players we're just calling our ace king oh this is beautiful all right so he chases everything this is why i'm not betting small here i hope for him to have something and go bigger. He can chase it and he will. And I don't give a shit about any flushes or so. We just keep freaking going. Let's bounce slightly. This guy is limp calling or like he was posting. Let's call, see what he's up to. Hitting a top pair on the turn. Good luck. King six. Fair enough. This is where money is coming from. Candy cash. The safe cash out. All right. Cool. limp calls king six fair enough this is where money is coming from candy cash the safe cash out all right cool someone who limp calls king six stacks off the top pair on the worst board possible this is where money is coming from pocket aids against 3x there i'm just calling three betting is an option as well but yes it's way higher variance i try to play like some lower variance gain more give them more spots like if i three bet he has not much and folds he played perfectly and i'll give him more room to do mistakes this here is a small checking back ace queen three small bad seven is just never never bluff but pocket eights are just not that interesting to continue even though for that price we might think about it king jack a no club from the big line we can't do anything still the high cards are not in our range. And here that queen-4, we can start with a bet. Okay, I believe you have a boat. So we have here just a random reg note because we have him on two tables now. And this guy limping, I mean he can have a king, he can have like anything straight- straighty he might be bluffing but not bluff raising and I don't get much money from block betting and get a call by a nine or an eight so I was going for the check call let's see his hand seven nine okay actually this limping this is enough this is enough like king seven min bed before he did that on the deuce four or five maybe this is some interest maybe not i just treat that as a check and put out a small c bet okay this might still mean anything yeah so it's like a c bad let's say let's say now for the price i did bet big now and we'll check back the return for that reason and river yeah call any bet i think i want to raise that ace king against a three-way pot here yeah let just give it up it's it's a nitty fold but here yeah you can't be too greedy i'm not scared of a bad re-raise yeah let's just fold to that i mean obviously i'm scared but like this then this combination of like small bet bet bet on the flop that's okay i said i want to play low variance then i should just call the river and only raise if i have a read that he does that maybe with some mid-peers or it's super crazy and I can actually raise call. Yeah, maybe the call for information in that stage is better. Yeah, pretty certainly. Just like it was so clicky that I should expect that a little more often. I'm just sure that he always has it. I'm not scared that I got bluffed here with a lead line is just too wild and I'm super protected. So, but maybe gaining that information, what he does it with that min lead mini race check turn and it seems like all those trappy lines like small river like four times trappy line into aggression it's like this is enough to convince me that's just a river call that was too greedy and didn't give me any information information is key here when we start normal tables and especially we have the jesus seat on this guy right i mean definitely i mark him as like a weak player all right so we see how fast that goes we have like 54 hands on this guy who is on two tables 28 18 8 this guy will be a solid dish right 88 players on this guy he has to be on another table as well here down here crazy multi-tabling right 24 21 6 we can't tell by now who is more aggressive or not that's not enough sample but we can say like okay those two guys they are somewhat knowing what they are doing and this guy might be like okay we have one node that he's super passive for it like the 7 5 student calls that that fits to 25 14 0 so just like that all together gives us a picture and we know right this is our victim here let's say right now on this table and this guy we just don't know what's up for now top right table we have a clear clear clear victim let's say very clear who donated us 40 big blinds already top left this guy is interesting just because of the lines we have seen and bottom left i don't know 18 hands with six zero like one big blind defense and that's it who knows maybe the biggest knit of all times and this 39 28 but this is not enough bottom left we don't know anything so far king queen off against this here from under the gun he has to be on multiple tables as well you can see it but maybe he was before not here right now but 71 hand means means multiple tables so far from that 2.7 king queen just a clear fold and queen 3 is not really hitting like before i had 6-4 in that spot 6-4 off that can make something nutted for that high spr we can make super nuts stacks whatever two pairs but like a queen 3 can't hit a shit so skipping that ace 5 this guy is 9 off happily going for it he's 100 vip so far this small lead i mean i'm playing in position this is a wreck so he's probably studying that he leads that from the small blind very interesting now i'll take this safer way here check go from there easy fold and he got the jack ten of spades that makes a lot of sense right triggers triggers him They are the over cards with a backdoor back for everything is to your farts I'm not going smaller because of the hand that I'm having but because of the position with more players behind Oh now we are priced in damn it It feels bad because I need to play and most of the time lose nine big blinds But actually it's good because it means this is a plus to be option compared to the fold i would have done just against this guy and now we are freaking in this cold call guy can have nine stands jacks ace queen obviously very frequently but he will jam turns and we cannot fold without that clear read he can have just queen jack suited king queen i don't know anything about him so far it doesn't seem like i put him on jacks queens then best option is just to rip it okay someone was trapping here i mean we have our safe equity even if they have their sets queens that's perfect we flip for all that money and end up winning pocket queens i don't know take it king nine three x but it seems standard 70 just probably bad player so look for a slightly loose defend can be just an any two c bet here so king of spade king high plus that i'm going to call and sometimes winning a showdown when checks down now it's like an okay plan 940 so i'm slightly happy that he did not open race it's not enough information to not three bad nines but he starts feeling bad when there's any action even though it's like not real information those 24 hands this board sometimes checking sometimes betting a3 let's roll let's roll the check let's go with the randomizer i mean not that i need one here but the problem is i don't know whether this guy is bluffing or not i need him to start like some bluff to make that better small bet i'm definitely raising it up take over control it's not like that he caps me and then comes over with lots of over bets on turns this is not how people play got take over here deny equity charge him okay that's beautiful but again here I don't think that I need to trap really now he has something right so he connects with that board now he connects even better he can have Jack ten he can have Queen ten and so I don't want to allow him those check backs yeah I just keep going all right flush we don't care have it. I don't know which one, but give him a chance to call with the jack to have a straight. Yeah, I think only all in makes sense. I could block that, but then I need some queen ten gems, something like that, that I don't see. So yeah, a gem has to be best. So when you don't know players, right, maybe he's not good and just calling because he has trips. Maybe he's better and then a smaller size is better because it's really tough to find a bluff here for me. It's really incredibly tough with that run out, everything getting there. Any jack should be kind of an easy fold, but this is just a main mistake that, let's say, a percentage of the player pool is doing. You just stack off when they have like a strong absolute hand strength. So yeah, what can I do, right? This here think it's good enough for a block bet against ace high i have so many busted draws you can have a four you can have three obviously better pairs as well but i think it's good enough ace four is three ace high here we go next king high right okay raising he was limping all the time if he limps i'm just like putting it on 10 big ones and go against him But now it's just a fold. Maybe a race is just stronger. I'll saying that he gets it in with anything. Okay, not my turn That's slightly stronger than ace three off. Let him chase something right not an easy decision Still let him chase something Check ten, that's okay So I think that was my best option right like you can have Queen 10 King Queen and so on Queen 10 here I'm going to c-bet and I will barrel that quite often with a 10-9 suited blocker Queen 9 suited blocker against him that's important as well Lots of trash that can fold some point. 3-5 against two regs. I'm not playing. A7 suited. I prefer to check raise the wheel backdoor draws like the a3, a4, a5 suited so this here is a call. Hitting a seven is still worth something with top kicker. He might have a seven as well. Yeah I mean now the hand is over unfortunately. Our friend Agatoki just in the next hand. King, Queen, the other guy just a flush. Nothing you could do. Ace for... Yep, going for c-bet. Third it's like just... Yeah, again can only stay at 15 minutes in the session. And we have already an okay-ish idea of what's going on here, right? How are the people playing?'s a weird donk right so two more aggressive lines top left there I went for that ace three of hearts raising against the donk because in queen deuce deuce there shouldn't be really donking so I just play it as if it was a check and I see that and the turn giving me the 12 outer i went for an overbet he shouldn't have too many deuce x and it's more like i can have kings i can have aces i can have ace queen and well he can have ace queen as well but not kings and aces necessarily and bottom left was like kind of a standard check race like c-bet king for a deuce with ace four turn was a queen which is a good card for me but my hand wants to check as i would do it with like pocket fours for example then i had the ace of the backdoor flush not that relevant but just a like nice navigation card i call it and yeah that means i went for the check race against a small step a small step that size is hand strength for lots of those players and it wasn't a spot where you should bet small very often so it's just like he probably had a little something and i just blasted him away taking down another pot the other option was a check call but i think i was always behind this is very very close without anything smaller versus hijack mainly a fold now again i go for a slightly too loose action and pocket aces all right so yeah i hope you enjoyed that i'll wrap it here. Pocket aces being the start for the last orbit. 26, 24. Snap, snap, snap. It could be kings only. It could be someone just getting an ace king. I believe he can have bluffs. This is why I go for the trap here now and will be calling. Just because this is enough for me. 90 hands, super aggressive, never calling, four betting. So this fits to his game style that he not calling, like King-Jack suited. And just can put me on something to find bluffs here. And it's very reasonable to have aces in our calling range here as well. So theoretically okay, and I just make a decision based on that. And now Kings, Queens. He probably just has Kings, and the ace is just our action killer. What can I get from Kings? What makes somewhat sense?ing on ace so he has show our value here can he put me on five six some stupid stuff probably not i think this is what i need to do snap call snap call and it will be king's under the gun for bet i mean we get it in i'm not losing much money trapping aces versus kings because it goes in on all boards just not when there's an ace and there are not many aces left so that's unfortunate but yeah this is if he has different stats I'm just gripping it because under the gun 4-bats are just people have nuts. 90 hands of this stats gave me the vibes that he might be a slightly different player who knows maybe that's the thing but like the snap 4 bad safety in 50 big blasts together with the turn card if you would have shoved I would have called yeah I don't know whether he's talking about pre flop or the river if he calls a river gem I don't know how good that is okay cold call here donk big doesn't make any sense but 2020 is 16 players just not bluffing so he can have it Alright last time we were playing. I hope you enjoyed that one seeing some NL 10 action absolute unknown territory But like you can see how much a HUD can help or just writing seeing some showdowns How much that can help if you're playing on a site that doesn't allow HUD and really how fast you can have notes or like know your table position who your victims are who are you after who are you trying to avoid maybe who can you do you make the big folds against who are you thinly value betting who is giving you the donations it's very very important just knowing where your money comes from and yeah i mean it's a stupid saying in an old one but it's just still true if you don't know who is the fish on the table or where the money is coming from you are actually the one giving the money you are the fish on the tables keep that in mind and always be prepared if someone asks you where the money is coming from to give him or her a very good answer
