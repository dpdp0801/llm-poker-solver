### TOPIC: cash hand review 3
 Hey everybody, so it's been a while but let's have a look at some hands I played actually. I just found some spare time and thought why not do the last little review of the last day I was playing which was August 3rd and yeah it was actually like that. I was in a session like my standard evening session. Everything of that session right now I didn't review it. I have nothing in my mind to it. I don't remember a single hand right now because this was obviously not important at all even though actually the last last day went pretty good. That was sweet. Yeah, so I thought why not looking those hands up together? I just filtered for like cut out the zoom 200 hands. I only went for the high stakes GG and ACR hands So yeah, let's go from there and maybe it will be a little fun to see some of those hands and yeah for me And maybe for you as well. So we'll just go as always through the biggest ones just position by position Let's see what I liked what I did. Maybe I was something I remember some maybe not and go from there So we only actually have 85 hands from early position pretty much two big hands and everything else gracefold or race and take So let's have a look. I'll kill his hand here for now. So, you for now so you know the king eight suited so you will probably play it like I did and here I open raise he defends big blind we have a board that we shouldn't see that very high frequency on like it's pretty much only ace king that really wants to bet most of the time like the ace queen is a heavy mix already but yeah I went for it this time and we have a quite an aggressive player here 25 19 12 3 bad check raises 16 on the flop super low sample doesn't mean anything but he seems like capable of like playing so just all the stats combined yeah just everything fits together so he's calling we get an ace on the turn i keep going 75 he has so much ace x himself blocker issues are huge no reason to here. And the river is a 5. That shouldn't change much. Ace-5 makes a boat here. That's about it. And I keep barreling. And yeah, he freaking rips it. Goes for a risk reward of risking. What is it actually like? Yeah, we have same stack. So it's the actual 545 to win those 196. So 545. Let's just say 200. Well, actually I can do do that here let's take the 196 pretty much he needs 74 fold equity to book a win here actually yeah depending on how we want to think about blockers just think about if he has a bluff he doesn't have an ace probably maybe you can bluff an ace as well but then you're running into the bolts all the time i don't know yeah so maybe blockers even even increase that number but yeah so here i have a decision i have a pure random bluff catcher but this guy and i played with him a little before this is just the three six table seems splashy and here it's like a spot where it's very easy to over bluff because actually you don't have ace eight offsuit necessarily you don't have a six offsuit necessarily and you don't have ace five off suit maybe sometimes but yeah that's about it so we have actually two combinations i have a blocker one combination of ace eight suited we have one combination of ace six suited the ace six of spades and we have one combination of ace five suited the ace of spades again so having spades here would be even better for me and then i just don't believe a shit that's slow playing sixes and eights for like all the way and yeah then we have eight six six seven seven eight it's like potential bluffs just the seven doesn't make any sense but it's just what people do six five of hearts i mean six eight yeah i said that eight five something like that it's just too many potential bluffs that i definitely want to look up here sometimes and here i went for it and he was like just incredibly overdoing it with uh i mean having the eight of spades is Thank you. that it's just too many potential bluffs that i definitely want to look up here sometimes and here i went for it and he was like just incredibly overdoing it with uh i mean having the eight of spades is kind of a good one it blocks ace eight of spades it's blocking pocket eights but if he does it with king eight queen eight jack eight eight nine and so on it's like just too much so i found this hero call i'm not not beating any value and yeah so we did went for this here so So next one little higher stakes 5k ace jack three-way short stacks 20 big blind game i'll go for a squatter c-bat or actually 27 i think i'm playing here is it no we see it so here at 25 i have different hotkeys for the small sizing actually have different sides doesn't make any sense but whether it's 25 27 i don't give a that's too tough to go for to the options and find that again so yeah i just go all the way here and i get a call from east queen high interesting he blocks queen jack suited and he blocks ace jack i'm not bluffing anything better so it's it's probably an okay random catcher i think having a queen is just really not good but yeah that's it let's start with those and go to middle position i should switch that to big blind but big dollar numbers always look better so i'll just go through what is that for bad and here a check check bet fold so let's just take those no this is re-raise fold so actually just the top two here again pocket jacks this is insane like usually i remember like all the hands but poker was like one second after that after leaving the session was definitely out of my mind so yeah i go for a call only slightly deep yeah i need someone to call like all the pocket nines pocket eights pocket sevens and so on against my four bet but that deep i want to polarize a little more and therefore use a bigger sizing which kills that so jacks go more into the calling range still sometimes a four bet but that's it so he goes for a small c bet i'm still beating kind of value he can range bet he has 10x which he will check down and so on so we can fold pocket nines here but never pocket jacks clear call turn queen is obviously great card for me because he doesn't improve and he has to be scared with his pocket kings and aces that i have a queen so check check and on that eight river i think i have no option but block betting here yeah my hand is look alike to all the bluffs he could check back kings and aces so I cannot really go huge he has all the 10x so I think block bet is the play and I didn't so I was greedy so maybe we have a calling station as an opponent here but actually it's let's run that how close is it between the two bet sizes maybe I was right in game and I'm wrong now that would be even better i just run it a little on the side and we'll have a look later again so i went for the big size okay a little greedy i guess but why not and we get the call from the freaking 10 9 right perfect let's have a look we did have a queen 10 3 flush draw board villain is allowed to bad range and we can fold 9 7s, 6s and actually we can start folding freaking pocket jacks as well if we don't have the backdoor. This is insane, right? Villain is betting range and my argument for never folding jacks was he has 10x and he will check them down. So I have a clear returning stream. Like my investment, I know where my money is coming from. Villain has a 10, he checks down. That's a great plan because this will happen. I know villain is playing that like that. He won't turn like his 10x into a bluff on a 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 and so on. So I thought this is clearly enough. We see it's super close, right? The ones without diamond are 0 EV. The ones with are clear plus EV. So I went with a slightly loose call. We now know villain had 10, 9 and the turn was another queen. Let's make it the queen of hearts obviously i could donk pocket queens sure why not i definitely did not donk anything i check and villain has 10-9 of something checks back this is where my money is coming from he can check back kings and aces that was my main argument right he's only betting those with the ace queen and king queen suited blockers and actually here kings with diamond aces with blockers that was my main argument for only having the small size on the river but let's figure out river was an eight and we see the crystal clear block bet with a pocket jacks here big bet just not good because i run into kings and aces which are always calling and villains should have some traps as well let's have a look at the traps here pocket queens some king queen not betting here right letting east jack improve when when king queen makes a boat so it's just like not a good big bet but i was greedy in game let's have a look whether i got rewarded villains 10 9 is obviously a zero ev kind of call but a high frequency oh this makes a lot of sense okay then i like my bat actually right 10 9 needs to call all the time so villain had a good play but i allow him to fold jack 10 actually it doesn't does that make a difference i block jack 10 anyways but yeah it's just i run into too many stronger hands like here aces kings just very high frequency plays and yeah so the block bet it is and then villain needs to call like partly his ace king and all the peers and so on because i'm sitting on all the freaking king jacks and so on like super easy to over bluff if we start bluffing ace jack with the wrong suits or stuff like that so yep i like the block bet and great that my mind works better now than it did a week ago after not playing poker for a week but no i i still have in mind who that guy was and i i think being greedy there is fine so that's okay Okay things going my way this is another 3-6 this is a hand you only sometimes for but it's like a hate call off if you get jammed on but it's a really great hand to have if he calls because he calls ace queen suited and ace jack suited and this is actually a squeeze so he's even more linear here and has more hands that I dominate like ace queen, ace jack Ace-Jack suited, Ace-Ten suited, King-Queen suited and so on. Which he partly is only calling from the Black-Big-Blind versus MP. But with a recreational player in between, probably always squeezing. So I think Ace-Queen is my main bluff actually. So I can range bet here and yeah, take it down. All right, let's go to the next position. And still wait for the Sim. So here we just lose a little one in EV. That doesn't matter. Let's just see what's coming up here. King Jack suited. Three bet. Cutoff versus early position. Get the call. I guess I see that half pot on that board. Here we go. Face the check raise. Yeah, hating my life already. Without the backdoor flush draw. Actually, I'm indifferent right now. He's a very aggressive player, but usually doesn't go all the way so like i definitely want to call every top pair against him against some little tighter players we could consider folding like i'm not doing great against his bluffs anyways so four is obviously one of the best cards in the deck kills his pocket force very likely that people are not having their four or five bluffs so yeah just kills his value combos and now his ratio of bluffs is just too high so he needs to shut down with a lot so we are hoping for the check this one i decided to check back betting small is fine as well and here he jams and i didn't believe a shit so yeah like maybe he has seven six and seven eight of hearts so be it right but it's like yeah i i don't believe this and we see actually a hand that i just don't understand like the the Jack-9 suited preflop is bullshit. The check raise I can see. The river jam is like, I'm bluff catching here. I'm freaking bluff catching against a jam. Okay, he could have block bet. I probably only call even though I should raise, but I don't see the hands that I have value against. I don't know, Jig has 16, right? So I felt like a hero making the call. someone was value betting thinner take it cool and raise three bet ace king face of four bad yeah against under the gun i i call even more often than i jam here just because people are so freaking nitty from under the gun and yeah i'm actually happy to not see a king i bought and stack off against aces so yeah there is one day that i find ace king falls pre-flop there against a certain player type queen off what happens here small c bed facing a check race i don't know this small check race we are playing 50 big blind steve i'm not a big big blind specialist that probably makes sense i have no clue what i'm doing so i kind of try to him up here yeah against his polarized range i guess he has some gut shots which i'm attacking here if he's check raising yes some kind of five six fuck him up here. Yeah, against his polarized range. I guess he has some gut shots, which I'm attacking here. If he's check raising, he has some kind of 5-6. And yeah, I never think he has like a king or like medium strong hands, so I'm just folding out equity. I could check back as well and give him three cards, especially having spades, but I don't know. Weird spot, weird spot. So here, three betting, I've pot, I guess. Yes, 10 of diamonds. I don't want to have spades. His main folds now are ace queen and ace jack of spades that call the flop and fold the turn, so I guess this is a check back, I want to say give up, we still have like six outs and the chance to bluff the river, I think I'm not, like I'm checking back jack 10 and queen 10 of spades the same way, yeah, and we have plans for the river, and yeah, he bets big, and that makes it easy, what do we have here oh yeah this is just 10 bb on 10k yeah losing to an ace deuce offsuit rejam okay that's a little ambitious i guess do we have here another 50 big blind game cut off versus button against i think this was the recreational i go for a bad bet with my 10 of hearts overcard plus gut shot and probably give up on rivers yeah and yeah the king can suit it so that's a fine hand king four suited see that get check raised i guess a very good card for me in the deck right so he has way less queen x and my jacks tends king's aces my my advantage just increases in value but now the question is obviously a flush draw sucks now yeah flush draw really sucks it's not outs anymore a king and a four like a king is great four is like whatever so i'm not sure whether i should stab that this is something i would need to look up how to structure like my flush draws here what to stab what not to stab i don't think i can just stab range but yeah he bets 15 and i actually fold it this year i think he has just a deuce very often or a low pocket i don't think people find that jack eight of hearts give up and then going for 15 if he block bets we can think about everything but it's like yeah i did believe him even though it was a great price and it was actually my board so yeah fine as well let's keep going you see lots of green here lots of green that's good he's king on oh this is two four someone like short stack check raises without the hearts i think the money needs to go in the middle yes ace jack all right let's go ace check offsuit here call pre-flop i'm not sure about those freaking short ranges i only play those those tables with like big recreationals so yeah oh now now i remember the hand what the fuck this was in the afternoon this was an incredible hand so again with ace king and face a four bat from under the gun and we are playing an l 10 000 here against a very good player yeah against a very good player and i go for the call i should sometimes jam but still here i think this is a player who just started playing 10k who moved up the stakes it's very very likely that he's not over bluffing from under the gun and is like slightly value heavy here and then ace king just is not doing great right it's like i'm running into queen's kings aces and ace king and that's about it people are slightly too nitty they call jacks and tends to often instead of like for betting sometimes they like this is a benefit if i fold those hands out or if they call kind of or just the bluffs that he has like some kind of something and i'm winning so yeah this board and i think against a small bet i have an easy continuation against a big bet i have an easy fold i mean sometimes call but that's like one of those zero ev calls i like just folding them and yeah we face a check oh interesting so what is villain sitting on he either has a trap and is checking because it's a great board for me or he has a give up which is something like king queen of hearts king 10 of hearts ace 10 of hearts ace queen of spades so i'm dominating those so i think i can step here but especially with the ace of clubs i prefer the check back because i don't want to get check raised off my backdoor club equity so I decide to check back here and now the five of spades is actually an incredibly good card for me, which I didn't realize in game. I was more focusing on my hand and like is there any chance I win this shit instead of really seeing the big picture which happens when it's just NL 10k instead of NL 200. And he checks again to me which he should check almost full range and now I improve to 5-6. I like all my shit hands that I have sometimes in my range pocket 8s pocket 9s just got some more equity. Villain's hands like something like king queen of hearts got even worse because on the flop they still had options of the backdoor straight of the top pair and so on he might be drawing dead. My 4-5 obviously is way stronger now as well so with the clubs I should mainly start stabbing even though I'm just folding out dominated hands i think i didn't run the sim with smaller sizes but i feel like it could make sense to stab even smaller here i rolled here on the turn to sometimes stab sometimes check and i went for the check which is the low frequency play and we get the freaking king on the river and that's half pop which is super interesting because there are no clubs for him they are no pocket kings for him there are no i mean pocket jacks never betting half pot i don't believe it for a second so this is maybe super trap pocket aces usually that's getting done with the ace of clubs a little more and mainly ace king maybe going for sneaky sneaky too thin value like my like my pocket jacks before with the king queen I don't see it I'm sitting there with lots of ace King myself. I can even check down King Jack twice so it feels a lot like ace King ace King ace King and Nothing like I don't find the traps and actually in game and I'm kind of proud of that I thought it's a great spot to just free roll him and jam it in. I'd have ace of clubs i play flushes like that i play ace queen of clubs exactly that way i've king jack suited i have ace 10 of clubs that i sometimes play that way so i think it makes a lot of sense and besides that it's freaking impossible that i find bluffs here tell me my bluff i think i should have the ace of clubs but yeah so yeah i ran that spot it's a high frequency turn bet very high frequency but if i get to that river here it's a freaking good jam and actually villain is indifferent with calling ace king depending on suits a little and he's even indifferent to calling aces if he has those ever and yeah there's pretty much no calling range but the slow play pocket jacks that call every single time. And I just think experience, have experience enough to just discount them completely with that sizing pattern. They either check the river or they just jam to get a call from like a hand like mine or whatever played differently before. So I got the 50 seconds tank and the fold. So I think he actually had a value bet, like most likely same hand. And and i got him off that which was obviously a very nice boost so we get that little nice 7k or whatever overall total redline winnings here it's always very very tasty so pocket eights here what happened here so for half pot on that board against the 40 50 bb stack to call oh he donks on such a great turn. All right, let him donk and he, yeah, pots it in and snap folds. So we found a bluff. Catching with the nuts by raising. Three bet, pocket kings. Here I go for a c-bet. Check is a very nice option as well. Check back turn. Rubber check and I go for a half pot again, which is greedy and you cannot do it against very good players, but on 600, I do it against pretty much everyone. And like if he finds the six five suited bluff that's okay i have ace x that i check back as well and yeah just i'm folding here all day long king ten suited three bad half pot bet on that board because four induced he doesn't hit many sets on right most most queen export i'm betting small but here he has five sixes sevens eights nines tens and so on so i attacked it with a little bigger sizing and that seven of diamond is just very very bad card but i'm unblocking hearts i'm blocking king queen and queen 10 suited so i can see myself betting here i can see myself checking here it seems kind of whatever well he goes for the dunk which i think let's double check that let's double check that because i just said like not in this world like this small dong i said in game not in this world i remember now and i just went for full crazy exploit and raised him which obviously is is total bullshit player but yeah let's see let's first double check on small sizing and big sizing on the flop then double check for let's just see what's what's that in percent i don't know my mind is getting rusty so this is 26.5 let's make it 27 donk size and what did i raise to that's like about 50 so that fits and see what's happening cool solver is running we'll find out soon he folded so i was right who knows now it's solved queen for juice with two diamond when villain donked and third diamond on the turn i think i messed up but yeah so oops still running okay i'll stop it okay queen for juice two diamonds can be at full range and we can include something in the bigger size this is pretty much i'm mixing here i think i said i use bigger size but that meant like i'm using bigger size also i'm not using pocket tenants pocket jacks for the bigger size a little more polar here and King ten clubs is fine with anything So I took the big size and villain wall check raising force check ring missing deuces Are people taking their five six in the pocket fives who knows but we are attacking those middle pockets here a little better So that was the goal of that and now the question is after the big size What happens in the seven of diamonds because against the big size villain is obviously continuing all flush draws and when they get there it's often an equity shift not here though because he doesn't have like sevens anymore so that set doesn't help him i can have it i have flushes myself so this is just what he let out here with a small donk and i just said like no my friend we can actually see that race is an option here with my king 10 of clubs even right so as an exploit i like to take those hands i thought it's actually absolute dog shit that i was doing but it seems like if i see that i love my play actually right so it's like the small race which we can understand that when we just have a look at what would we do if villain checks right so we figured out villain's donk bet is just shit if he checks what would we bluff we would take our we would take our king 10 of clubs and invest some more money as well right we block the queen 10 of clubs we block the king queen of clubs okay we don't have a diamond unfortunately but we cannot choose too much so it can make sense right and they're just like if something doesn't make sense i don't think that people just donk their flushes now. It's like, come on. No, they check to me and hope that I do something. It's like something that wants to buy a card maybe. Maybe it's a five, six of hearts, right? Maybe it's like, this makes a lot of sense to me. Scared of check raising. Let's take the, maybe let's take the five, six of spades. Decided to donk now. Maybe see a card for free. Not ready for facing any bluff raises. Cool. Nice. That feels nice that feels good so jacks here I definitely go for a big size even bigger than half pot on that board structure just like I'm always looking on the two cards that might give him sets like the low cards if it's like five and lower I increase my sizing always so I go from like quarter to half or from like half to 75 something like that just put more pressure on the pockets he has high frequency nine i keep going and he folds that's fine we tend suited calling three bad call bet okay that was easy and i'd offsuit freaking nuts half pot three way freaking no nuts anymore okay jack, jack three bet, fold to call to four, open raise, king jack, c-bet, call check raise, check check on the queen of diamonds turn. That is totally fine on the turn as well. And here it's only pot size left, so I think we have the clear value jam here. The river, I find bluffs, especially with my king of spades. He can have a river at seven six, he can have a five four, he can have like a weaker jack, he can have like a jack eight or something like that so a mandatory value jam here no worries we got small blind hands here look at let's go over 10 big blinds pot or net one so 20 big blind spots or lost ace jack suited and a 1k will in four bats oh check he see that small i rip it in i think that has to be fine his small bet like the question is if he's betting small with his range which is a mistake my jam is printing if he is playing well my jam is very is like close in a way because then he should jam lots of ace king and king queen and jack x hands himself just over bad jam in position because like what do you do with like ace queen ace king with a diamond if you face that check jam what do you do with i don't know king nine suited what do you do with a queen jack it's like you hate your life so this is pretty much that and then i run if if he see that if he has that in his arsenal and that's part of his strategy and then i'm check jamming his like full like an ace six of spades maybe or he has like something nutted that is ready to see more cards like this year that's okay. Ace check offsuit against a weakish player I go for a light three bet he calls we have the ace of hearts against him like 23 15 5.7 I'm a little scared I would do lots of clicking against players here but not against him because i don't expect many bluffs turn the ace of diamonds and river i think he has to have something right i i like just block batting now i don't know what makes sense because i can't put him on range i don't remember the hand i kind of feel that i feel like it went check check i sure. I did block that and he called. Okay. Now like I felt like I've seen a weird showdown, so this is definitely worth a note. All right. This is worth a note. Let's go put in this note. I have no notes, but those weird stats for now. So we've got pot versus PFR position versus small blind race, queen, five, three hearts. Yeah, I mean, this is just so random and some people have their moves on mono boards. Five deuce of spell, that's a bomb pot. Let's skip this one. Not much happening probably. Squeeze ace king here on 10k. Get a call and oh, c-bet and take it, okay. King, queen, range, check, board, check, check, turn, king king i go for the big bet and go for another big bet on that jack run out we get the jacket of clubs through a nice call value hands are so freaking easy why did i just i think i made a mistake here i think this is a clear mistake with that stack that i should go directional in. I think there should be a way just like getting this amount in and then having like a thousand dollars left. The key is all the king eight king seven like this feels my line or like the amount of money I put in the middle is perfect for like king nine. This just feels a little wrong. Obviously it's probably the perfect sizing to get the money from like a jack of clubs type of fan but yeah I feel like i that's that's not perfect i don't know check check here 10 of diamonds i guess with all options with our hand just kind of a joker and here i go for the block bet whatsoever get the race re-race non all in when i don't have the ace of diamonds and i block the jack high flush i'm not going all in here he can still have an ace of diamonds that he raised and he might go crazy. And I need to get the safe calls from like more two pairs and even lower flushes. So I split my flushes up there a little. Pocket eights, calling three bad. Facing that small sizing, I decided to check raise. Let's actually run that as well. I don't think that that small sizing is used too often on that board so this was kind of a reaction to his sizing it gets very very aggressive player which means he has his bullshit pre-flop and he probably likes to just keep the foot on the gas post-flop that's my read and this is what i try to sabotage here a little so first i'm checking and now actually three four five so many straights i thought this is more of a half pot board so i apparently was wrong learned something here lots of checking what is there in my range that's like i mean the six seven threes fours fives to this part so much bullshit i don't really know okay against the small size pocket eights are actually stretch i had the one with a heart i went for the small check race right we need this small sizing here we are only attacking his random high cards and seems kind of whatever so it is a stretch i was reading something into his sizing but actually he just took the right one so yeah the king tin of clubs we looked up i am super happy with myself this year i think i need to take a deeper look i'm just folding to a knit or bad from under the I've begun with my 10s because the price is not good. He makes it 2.5x, I make it 10x, he makes it whatever that is. My brain is really not working, so it's like is that 26.5 big blinds? What the fuck? This is really lots of big blinds, so this is a mandatory fold in my opinion okay that was it for the small blind so very interesting here so 3-10 offsuit okay oh we play a limp pot nice limp pot i have lots of ace five ace four i have deuce three i have lots of deuce x3x i have great reason to raise a lot here right so to really raise a lot so i want to do that especially when i have hearts and i have clubs and i have nut outs that's pretty sweet turning the nuts even better so i just pot it Thank you. right so to really raise a lot so i want to do that especially when i have hearts and i have clubs and i have nut outs that's pretty sweet turning the nuts even better so i just pot it i think i could go even bigger right i have three six he doesn't he has lots of pure plus flush draw actually i want to go bigger here go directional in and like just keep my three x and three in in like one range here why not right what can he do rubber nine and there i just went for three quarters because he obviously has like all three x as well but given all the pier plus flush draw i think i can easily get away with a pot bet here as well get the fold right okay so nice important to find those little understand the limp pots as well a little and then this year three way the weaker player open raises button whatever rack like no clue what this guy's up to he's I've seen a couple of weird plays. I flopped the monster drop. So we got this guy half potting. Seems rather strong, to be honest. This guy raising against half pot. Which, obviously, half pot from a weaker player. And then some whatever dude raising. Yeah, I don't know. I have the equity with my hand, even against sets. But I'm not going anywhere. If I have, like, not have like six seven of spades i think i'm just folding feels insane but this is just like i have it and i i have it even more so i re-raised like that the way i would play with my jack ten i play jack ten like that and i need to add something like this and then we get the fold and we get the jam which just feels good like him jamming like I mean sure he can jam pocket nines But I'm never having pocket eights here to be honest So he's just running to the jack thing This gave me a very very bad feeling to just run into jack ten of diamonds And I have maybe some king-jack of spades, but I think that would more call on the flop So I'm not too scared of the draw under draw definitely not scared of a nut flush draw or so so i'm mainly running into pocket nines or the straight and yeah we run it two times and he has freaking jack ten offsuit maybe i need to collect some more hands on this guy here because this is quite a stretch like having jack ten offsuit here but yeah i'm fine with how i played here that's okay ace nine offsuit oh this guy was i have just 2720. This was the guy ace-deuce off rejamming, like being all in every hand. So I was ready to just punt in 35 big blinds. I thought about before the iso, right? But I've seen those guys just punting in with ace-five suited, ace-four suited, while three-axing it with ace-king and so on. So I was not isoing to fold, even though it's a lot. And yeah punished but okay maybe that was too much but don't want to be results oriented here so yeah another play on 10k here this is actually i looked that up i thought it's a low like a 25 percent cold for bet it's pretty much never won which is insane so i went for it anyways i get the call and then just go a little crazy on the board where no one has anything yeah strapping my strength it's fine if we have it in our range yeah this shouldn't be in our pre-flop range really so it's it's obviously too loose but it's a spot that is i guess very very under bluffed and to have those sometimes king jack was that a squeeze getting one call and here i'm really not sure how to continue here when you really have it somebody like ace queen ace 10 king jack himself like what would i do with ace king and ace jack like i don't know he has ace x of spades so he's passive so i just wanted yeah i hate this i was sure i'd just keep going he's passive i just wanna don't give a shit right he will find reason he has 10x of spades he has ace x of spades he has king queen maybe he chases that i don't know enough about him i just want to blast here yeah i hate that small sizing what happened here 2.5x open from him queen six offset i'm not sure how it is short but if queen seven makes is the line for like three x or queen eight and then queen six has to be fine i call one it's like close already double gutter call another one. And now it's really tough to have air, right? I'm not calling king x on the turn. I'm calling ace x. I have 10, eight. I have jack eight. I have queen nine. I have nine, seven, both offsuit. And he checks the river and I'm happy. I have some clubs and I have this here. It's pretty much the only offsuit hand to all my value bets. So I'm jamming and he's like, he's... This... I think this is a ridiculously bad turn bet. An absolutely random river call. This was weird. I like, I remember this was afternoon session as well. No, actually not. I, but I remember that I thought about which note to write down here and I couldn't come up with any. Nice, nice. So got to finish this one. We'll go for a 10% bet, get raised and full turn. Okay. So one of the last hands and then we look up what happened here. Check call a half pot bet. Check call three quarters. Check call a half pot. Half pot, three quarters, half pot. Oh, like I don't know. Weird, weird weird size down on the river he's king oh okay recreational i squeeze not interesting not really check check check oh this was yeah after now seeing what he's playing like nice he checks twice to me i have a king i just go directional and like no matter what he has a five who cares river three he donk jams I'm like okay it I'm not folding but he has the the ace deuce off call on the turn so I think yeah but anyways pretty sweet day so let's wrap it up here let's leave that graph here for now and have a good time so yeah see you for the next one and I hope you enjoyed that one
