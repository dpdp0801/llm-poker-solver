### TOPIC: cash hand review 4
 Alright everyone, I'm thrilled for a new video type and actually, yeah, you can see it already. We will look over the shoulders of our very own Fedor Holtz today. So lucky me, he was streaming some cash. I'm actually not really sure when the footage is from, but it's not too long ago. And I just scrolled it all to the moment where he started to fire up a 5k table, I guess on GG. have two 1k tables but that will change over time yeah i'll run his footage on some extra speed and we'll stop whenever i think something is getting interesting and yeah we will comment a little on his play and just see how it goes i guess we have some major hands coming up i didn't have a have a look so far so we really want to use a fresh mind and then decide like okay maybe in the end we rate his play a little and yeah super super excited to what will be happening. So great chance to really see such a great player play higher stakes but even in a format that he's not like super familiar with. He's obviously a great cash game player as well, but that's not his standard environment. And he will definitely play against some very, very tough opponents on high stakes. They're already very decent players on the 1k tables here. So let's start right away with a i guess first hand here on nl 5000 heads up against ivan galinets who i think is a very well-known high stakes pro played on stars as well under croatian flag and he open seats those tables quite often so he decided to join fedor here and yeah we're playing some heads up queen 7-3 rainbow definitely a board where Fedor keeps his range advantage I think we can have multiple options here a c betting small with high frequency is just a standard thing you can definitely split your range here and play with a check back range and then sixes are obviously fine to check back as well from how I know Fedor I think he likes the batting pattern a little more so let see what happens next here. While Kevin is joining as well. Very, very, very good high stakes player. Fedor goes for the 40% bet. Gets called. Five is another, yeah, interesting card. I mean, I won't comment all the action, but we'll go into detail when I feel like Fedor has a real decision to make and this is what we see here for the first time so very very interesting how he decides what what button he chooses on that river i think he has multiple options and yeah against against ivan sizing we have a pretty clear bluff catcher here it seems to be some kind of hotkey sizing so on those stakes not too much to read into that he's wrapping like a nine axe plus i would say and yeah maybe a seven king seven makes the cut so uh something like that we are definitely not beating his value hands and now it's just about evaluating our sixes as a bluff catcher what could ivan's bluffs be all right so the four five five six the natural flop draws got they are hitting the five or making a straight we block the straight not sure how relevant that is here and yeah the queen six suited as two hands we are blocking and yeah so interesting to come up with the bluffs that ivan could have i would say this has to be more the broadway region the king jack jack 10 King 10 type of floats on the flop against that 40% sizing and yeah so I think we have kind of random catcher raising I don't know I don't like it too much just the 6-4-6-8 blocker seems somewhat yeah makes it somewhat cool to raise but I think this is not necessarily what what ivan reps the most and definitely an option as well to throw in sometimes there but yeah so yeah obviously guys it would be awesome to hear fedor's thoughts here as well but most of that footage actually he had music running that we cannot put on youtube so we are in silent mode just trying to look into his brain and see his decisions it seems like he's on the fold button quite a lot gets shown the eight i think the eight of clubs always has to be a value hand maybe some ace eight offsuit but that would be an ambitious bluff on the river i guess having so much showdown value so it's more like the the nine eight or the queen eight of clubs queen and offsuit obviously as well so yeah next decision i think already interesting is on the top right table pocket jacks and bottom right ace 10 suited so those jacks we can definitely four bet that as well we can call the three bet holding is not really an option while that ace 10 suited i guess we have the clearest call of all times i'm just trying to predict fedor's action every single time when things get interesting and, to just see when there's something different, something I did not expect. So I haven't seen that footage before. And yeah, let's just see. Because whenever something is different, then it's worth to dig deeper, right? That pocket jacks, check call up there. Super standard. Ace, 10 of clubs, no other options but calling. And now, yeah, he scrolled to that already. But but top table with the jacks i think block bet is the only thing that really makes sense we can do some checks to then check call but it yen should have some 10x in his range that we don't want to allow to check back we have something like king jack ace jack that we want to bluff so pocket jacks should be a clear value bet and that ace 10 suited down there let's see what we face i expect a high frequency c bet this time villain checks so now let's think about ace 10 of clubs i'm not really sure what to expect someone checking back queen eight seven can be lots of eight x seven x and with a double flush draw now on that turn that we unfortunately can't see right now here we go yeah I think we definitely want to use two sizings on that turn a small one to attack something like ace high ace two ace three that check back something like ace king and a bigger one to really go for stacks right away right something like two peers a straight a strong queen can go for stacks here and pretty much over like make it oh we had 200 big blinds deep so never mind for 100 bigs we easily get it in for 200 it's a little tougher so it will be less frequency in the big sizing ace 10 of clubs not having any of the flush suits so not a great playability on well any spade and diamond on the river i think is a pretty mandatory check here yeah some betting cannot hurt but we clearly have showdown values so yeah i expect the check pretty much all the time here top there getting max value from ace 10 i guess so nice hand fedor and nice hand etienne as well so yeah ace 10 i don't expect anything this just has showdown value villain might three bet some ace nine check down some ace four check down and yeah we see the six five that makes a lot of sense so right now going into that game if i was playing fedor here in that cash game i would already assume him as a tournament player not being on point with the ranges so i'm not sure whether fedor knows that king eight off is actually the bottom open race i would expect him to just raise king seven as well probably king six as well so my first adjustment as being kevin or ivan would be to definitely be a little more aggressive definitely trying to defend enough and not work with too much overfolding so yeah maybe something we can see over time a little more and well now i didn't i was just looking at the bottom table but that king jack off is already a zero percenter in our cash world the sizing is very small so we see the tournament pattern here I think teaminator shouldn't fold any pocket here obviously not a single suited hand against that sizing it's just too small and therefore not a challenge putting Fedor in a spot that is just yeah with a not great hand out of position in a three bad pot yeah king queen off is already mixed there I don't like his sizing yeah it's something you do with shorter stack sizes that he's used to in tournaments and yeah let's see how he continues from here so yeah very That a7-7, it seems like he considered both options. It depends a little now on how his range is built here. If he has those offsuit broadways, something like king-jack, I mean this is the worst hand he pretty much has in his range kind of. So that looked like quite a range bet to me. And yeah, it's just important important that teaminator defends accordingly it's easy to overfold those boards you need to float pretty much all the pockets all the backdoors and even some hands that are not necessarily like the this typical draws or backdoor draws so he probably makes some money gaining the overfolds there but would be interesting to see how he continues on like all kinds of turns with that trashy hand pocket eights on the bottom table it's interesting to spot now that kevin 200 big blinds deep open raises bigger i think we have both options with pocket aids three betting and calling so yeah we definitely want to have some kind of board coverage being that deep that it's like when we three bet against that sizing that it's not like jacks plus ace king and kevin can crush us on all kind of low boards so i would definitely roll in or consider randomize some pocket aids or just mix in in some kind of way as a three bet obviously call is the super standard fine play. Yeah, the check check on the flop. I mean, that's Kevin's decision. We don't know his hand, but those pocket eights, king of hearts on the turn, pretty much checking full range. No options here. Nothing to think about while those pocket tens will be mainly a three bet up there. Stack off against unknown, a Japanese player. Pocket eights, nothing to think about. We have a peer, we have hearts. We are playing big blind versus button let's check all that and facing a three times overbat on that river i mean that's pretty much kevin saying hey you never have queen 10 here and you're not trapping enough flushes because well what does he want to bluff here like that he cannot use the ace of hearts blocker sure he can have an offsuit queen of hearts so it's really tough to use blockers here it's mainly saying Fedor is not really protected here as he should be I don't really see that sizing from a for like in in if i solve that spot so it's we are in the exploitative world here definitely and yeah i mean fedor's pocket eights even though it is an eight of hearts in there it's just too weak of a hand to consider calling i guess you never know with fedor but yeah i think that's a call and the more interesting hand actually from our perspective here should be the top left we revert a two pair after check calling a small flop bet big blind versus button and all this is very interesting how we play that hand I'm a big favorite of my so-called look-alike principle so I'm just seeing that we have a nine or we have a queen which leads me to checking and then check raising that. If villain has an ace, he will value bet himself and he might bluff. So this is where our value comes from. If we bet ourself, well, we get the same money in, probably less because villain's ace won't raise. And well, what else is calling? Yeah, maybe some random catcher, but we are blocking all the calls, all the queen X, all the nine X. So I'm a big fan of really protecting my range with that type of hand and then check raising it. Yeah, it just fits together, playing lookalikes the same way. I see that El Fedor did check already, now seems to go for a little bigger sizing. I prefer a little bigger sizing than that 70% button. He keeps it small, okay. Yeah, just saying, villain never has a better hand, pretty much. He's not trapping on the turn, and ace queen is not really checking back often. So that's a very, very, very, very clean two-peer that should only maybe have an upside, like a cooler upside. Villain might have queen six suited, okay. Two combos, that's not too much. But yeah, I like in those spots to take a bigger sizing, and I'm pretty sure that the solves that we can get agree with me here okay ace ace deuce we see a check here small blind versus big blind if i got the action correctly this is a board we can definitely bet full range and the seven five seems like a fancy out of the box play to check here to put in a check race here yeah just a very very very like seems a little fancy play syndrome like here to me not not really sure about that while we see something else that fedor did was on the top table that is like the typical cash game regular doesn't do that he did open up a flatting range against an under the gun open and don't worry about my randomizer that's actually on all the time so we don't need that here yeah the problem is just against good players with good players behind you can only flat a couple of hands in middle position so you will always be face up on like ace queen jacks tens nines something like that you cannot flat four or five student profitably here so i'm really confused that he didn't start stabbing on that board because it's just his board having a jack and an eight and this is yeah it's that range awareness where i can feel pretty much right away even without listening to what he says that he's probably not aware of his actual range maybe he's way too wide in that spot flatting all kinds of things that he can do in a tournament environment where there's no rake taken off the table. That happens before when you enter the tournament. And there's an ante on top, which makes the price way better and allows you to play a real range. So something, right, you can see here, maybe we spot some small leaks here that we can put him on certain certain hands really just by saying okay not the typical cash player now check i mean what's this what is he bluffing on that river i mean sure he has showdown value it's i mean incredible to not bluff that king queen of spades here from under the gun what's his worst does he have any worse hands here on that run out that he doesn't bluff before? Yes, maybe some king-10 offsuit, but that's about it. So yeah, he has some showdown value, but I would say Fedor does not really have worse hands and he should start stabbing at some point if you really think about his MP flatting range here. Let's see that ace-king offsuit down there. Alright, so very nice spot top left. Federer decides to play a bigger bet strategy on that flop, which is totally fine. Villain has lots of things that we are attacking with a bigger size. He turns an eight, i think yeah that's more or less the only option and villain decides to choose a cool sizing to go for a thin value or a very very cheap bluff to even put this hand of fedors in a in a weird spot so actually i feel like he's looking at like well actually either one of those hands at the king eight of diamonds and this is the feeling I get with that small sizing Does villain really do that with the ace of hearts five? Does villain really turn a seven into a bluffs like that or am I just always paying off like it to peer or even? Just a jack while that ace King on that monotone board that we need to check a lot on that flop Ah even even hate seeing that small bet size. So what we see, especially on higher stakes, is just that people always hit those sizes that actually hurt the hands we have most of the time here. And yeah, let's see, K8, diamonds seems to be a fold for him. Ace, king, a very very thin call. Now obviously easy fold against that big pot-sized batter. 6-5 offsuit, very happy to see that fold since this is not even close to an open race. I was a little scared that Fedor is going too crazy here. As he is here with 5-2 suited from the button, absolute no-go even though you sometimes flop two pair. So yeah, the reads on the tournament players are on point and yeah let's see how it works out for him being a little too loose so very very interesting spot here this is one that i whenever doing a coaching i'm talking a lot about is it's a board that you are allowed to see at a very very very high frequency and usually people use a small sizing there is merit for a bigger sizing as well since villain has lots of those officer broadways he doesn't have any nuts right now right he doesn't have queens not jacks no kings no aces if we consider that nuts no queen jack suited usually so it's a good spot to attack with a bigger sizing right away but it's often very very tough to find the bluffs so Fedor decided to take his backdoor straight backdoor flush draw here and include it in a bigger sizing usually that is something that I like to overfold against quite a lot because people see their pocket kings they want to get the money in right now they see their ace queen they they see their whatever they want to protect from king 10 10 9 ace 10 but just like click the small c bed with all their bluffs so i'm super happy to see that with that like first i mean you can play that with a small sizing only as well that would be fine but if you want to implement a big sizing i love seeing some of those bluffs here and now actually after batting big it's getting interesting right it's like we wrapped something like kings aces ace queen stuff like that and now the question is what are our best bluffs right we can have something like king 10 sure 10 9 sure with all kinds of equity but this hand blocking the turn two pair blocking the set if villain sometimes calls fives maybe is an option i think personally it has too much showdown value and i rather have like one of the clear draws so yeah i think i checked that back most of the time but if you look that up in a solver as well it's just a very very nice blocker it just blocks villains queen five that he calls down all day long well even though the queen five suited he's not blocking here having the diamond so it's just jack five and four five but yeah realizing that that five doesn't help villain at all he keeps his advantage just choosing that very very big sizing i prefer to go a little smaller than two times pot but yeah now a clear check back having that showdown value against ace ten against fades against four but yeah king jack calling that two times pot bet is very very thin it's one of those can not 100% mix whatever calls because the two pair outs are not clean if there is a king and you get jammed on you're not happily calling off right there's no worse value hand that is still jamming on a king so you have a jack you yes the king locks value and bluffs both. It's just like one of those random hands I'm catching against you where well one thing just like with the image of Fedor I would always try to stay a little more value heavy in those spots. I think that five is slightly over bluffing even though the thought process is very very correct and maybe even better in other spots where villain has less of those floats that we have showdown value against right here just checking down against ace 10 king 10 or catching the river even on brick runouts has quite a lot of value so what when we use those turn two peers is very very different let's say in ace high boards if that is like an ace king four or five then this is perfect for us right there's there's way less of that stuff we have shown on value against we have way more like classical catchers that we check back on the turn to then call off a river here i prefer the turn check slightly and yeah uh really surprised to see that five six suited top left not in 100 three bad yeah, might be a thing. I don't expect him to randomize too often. So more showing like what he feels like at first instinct and not sure about the tournament ranges there, but I would just expect that to be in a 3-bet most of the time in his world too. So very, very, very interesting spot there on the river uh i mean the turn spot was interesting as well looking at that five six suited check hauling is 60 65 percent flop bet and then check raising against a 75 percent bet or so just another normal size bet on the on the turn yeah with this double flush draw board and now actually let's think about the three how it changes things how much does it help villain here how many four x does he have i think some four x of spades some four x of hearts but really just from the button like king four ace four that's about it pocket fours are not double barreling here four five not double barreling ace four of diamonds not calling the turn check race so it's really just a couple of hands and i'm actually not scared really of that of that river it's straight sure villain has seven nine so here i think we have still a pretty easy value gem just against all the over peers and ace eight and stuff like that and if the seven makes a straight on the river it's a very very different thing but yeah i'm happy to jam here i don't think with this two pair that i want to check haul ever just unblocking the eight seems pretty pretty nice if i have eight six something like that or just a i don, a five something of spades, we can check raise on the turn sometimes as well. I consider check calling just because of all the flush draws that busted that villain has given the sizings we used. And I would love to see him still realize the spot here and go for the thin value gem. Block bet is another option as well. I think we have the value for a big bet and do not need to block bet that one. But yeah. Maybe same hand. Okay. Okay, so king 10 on that ace, ace, jack, 10. This looks like a range c-bet with his hotkey sizing turning a 10. Yeah, I mean, now, interesting spot. Seeing that min bet, and we definitely have a call here. We cannot fold king 10 to, what is that, 12% pot. Yeah, it's just like, where's the point we would want to raise? And I could even see that being a 10 where the kicker plays like is a jack just betting 12 pretty much always being ahead or just clicking the 25 sizing is that more like a queen 10 10 9 type hand i don't know i would definitely consider both calling and raising folding not an option and yeah i would like to see him tank a little whatever decision he makes actually the more i think about it the closer it gets for me so i'm fine with either way but he seems to be talking to consider everything that's really really fun to see and he decides to just go for the call and it's like sometimes it's not so tough to read in two hands. This is just, what calls on the flop? What decides to go for the thinnest of all values on the river? I said queen 10, something like that. So king 10 it was. And this is something how watching those videos, there are other great YouTube videos out there. Just check out the channel, like MyPlayingExplains. Check them them out as well and just try to do the same thing i'm doing here right just predict what's happening you see showdowns you see how very good players play and spot the situations where things are different that's actually the best thing when you have the feeling that i don't know and you see a very good player to have the same feeling he doesn't know either or it is like very very close That's the best confirmation you can get so here seeing Fedor contemplate every option and then really seeing Ivan having Exactly that type of hand just like gives me a good feeling and this is something Yeah, you might think about flatting your pocket fives here calling that off as a bluff catcher and then looking into king 10 all the time here you got the same thing without just paying the money so very very nice to see that all right here we go again mr mtt pocket fives is the line in my charts so pocket threes with his weirdly small sizing. Yes really a thing in the tournament world it's just too wide so something if you spot something like that right in this spot you should have like small man versus button against the standard first in range you should have like 15 percent three bad things that you could do now it's just well against his smaller sizing it's getting tough but for betting quite aggressively helps and you could even if someone uses the standard 10 bb sizing for example and even against that seeing that king jack offers this cut off seeing those pocket threes here you can just implement a jamming range as well like there's no way villain calls enough to not make your pocket force pocket deuces jam profitable mix it in with some other a jack ten suited type of hands ace king offsuit so there are plenty of options and i want you to just like think things through okay why is that a mistake what he is doing it's like not a mistake in the first place if you're not reacting accordingly so i always want to know okay what is the correct reaction first of all not overfolding right something that king six suited jack eight suited fist bump snap calls against that sizing and fedor's range here very very important to not run away in spots like that top right ace queen you can bet almost full range on that rainbow dry board here and yeah here now what i would love to see would be kevin being obviously super linear cold 4-betting on the very very light side, right? Fedor is forced against that sizing with that stack death to call all pockets if he has them too often. It would be awesome to see Kevin not only 4-bet like 9s plus but have to have like 7s plus, something like that. To have like not only ace-queen, ace-jack and and some ace ten suited but to go even looser here so i hope to see a showdown maybe find a hand like that that is something that fedor cannot defend against properly anymore just because he started with too wide of range ace queen on that jack not really happy obviously because the main hand that timinator has offsuit is ace jack that that we beat. So the jack is a very very different card to a six here for example. Villain does not really improve to second best hands. It's still enough to go directional in for ace-queen but it's not the moment we should be happy and if the river is hearts or is bringing some other things like a 10 would be bad as well then all of of a sudden our ace queen cannot really go for stacks anymore, which would really hurt. So now that ace queen I think is too thin of it. I'm actually not sure because the ace of hearts is out there, but villain has all kinds of flush draws. Backdoor king high flush draws that did float the flop. All the eight acts of hearts and given Fedor's small sizing, I told you already preflop that pretty much the suited hands cannot fold. Thank you. the flop all the eight acts of hearts and given Fedor's small sizing I told you already pre-flop that pretty much the suited hands cannot fold so that ace queen I think is just a block bet and then evaluate or even a check fold I think stacking off is too light here right for every nuts that call against you you need to find a hand that calls you and you beat more or less villain will have all ace-jack combos, pocket eights, pocket threes, ace-eight, ace-three, maybe not those that he raises at some point. He will have seven eight of hearts, maybe six eight of hearts, eight nine of hearts, ten eight of hearts, king-queen of hearts, king-jack of hearts, king-ten of hearts, maybe queen-ten of hearts, nine-ten of hearts. So these were a couple of combinations for every one of those that i just listed fitter needs to find almost one combo that villain calls and that he is ahead of one like ace nine of spades some of that and i think this is very very tough now let's see whether he reconsiders and does not jam or he closes his eyes and hopes to get looked up very very light so nice this is exactly what i just described what i what i like to see in those formats here is really snap clicking the all-in bar to the very right there thinking about it i'm sure he's talking about it as well and then reconsidering pretty much having go through his head what i just talked about and then making a different decision just on the go just realizing how ranges play here so nice queen jack of diamonds it's obviously very very close turn call there and that pocket three is this is just like the fight back from the king ten it was another player there before but just going for the 10 bet fighting against all the ace highs in the world. I like to attack like this is lots of face-up sizing just attacking that very very thinly for value is great and then adding some bluffs obviously this is you just need to call enough to not allow Fedor to just bluff his 4-5 of clubs there too profitably and yeah unfortunately we don't see a hand but yeah very very interesting so again typical tournament player thing 10-8 offsuit in the big blind not really a defense in the cash world where we pay rake where there is no ante where we face a tight mp open raising range that we are actually dominated quite a lot pretty pretty thin and just something we need to consider right on boards like that i think the big bet yes can be a thing attacking jack x king queen king 10 queen 10 which should be the majority of fedor's range actually but if if he has all kinds of random bullshit as well, we should consider other sizings as well. So yeah. Here we see the same pattern again. King-queen offsuit against under the gun. You can 3-bet that but definitely not 100%. I'm sure Fedor is not randomizing here. So same pattern over and over again. And this leads to over folding versus four bets for example. A queen to an offsuit with the queen of spades, clear defend, not really an option to raise there we want to have more the connectivity around the 6-3 or something really drawing to the nuts like ace-5 offsuit with the ace of spades on that run out we have the clearest of all value bets i think the 75 sizing does the job quite nicely it's just our hand strength pretty much will needs to catch enough yeah pocket sevens being a random catcher actually with like bad blocker how you call it yeah just like blocking the seven x is a bad thing for you so i would prefer to call a six x instead of pocket sevens but yeah so speeding things up here a little while while there was nothing really interesting going on so that king four suited having an easy flop check call and now a top right table i'm talking about on that deuce turn that's a board that you mainly overbet on the turn because the big blind doesn't improve on that deuce at all yeah and now it's interesting for for fedor to think about okay which of those random peers should he be calling once more right he is definitely not beating any value hands and now it's just the question how does he do against villains and bluffs and what i think about here is always what good stuff is happening for me that is villain betting certain hands that are definitely giving up on the river usually we talk about flush draws here and unblocking those hands then you know exactly where ev comes from right let's say the deuce was spades here villain c bets ace eight of spades and checks back on the river so this could be a reason for certain hands to call and here on the deuce i don't find those and then i look as like what good stuff can happen when does my hand get all of a sudden a value hand again and here on a king if villain blasts big then again we still have a bluff catcher with our two pair so it's like i prefer to have four five for example for that reason here if the river is or even four six even better right having a clean two pair that villain that's 75 on the river wrapping kings ace queen ace is something like that king queen and i can still check raise for value this is what i'm looking for so here we have like bad properties with that king four is obviously a nice card to have have. The king is whatever. The four as an out is eh. It's like one of those eh random. Where I can see the fold right away against under the gun. And yeah. Calling is obviously not too bad. Let's see. Ace-deuce. I really don't like that line by Etienne. I think this was very, very bad. Just like the Deuce blocker, if you want to use it, use your overbet line. Play it like, like just fold out all those king, four, whatever type of hands. Do it on a flush draw board where you can check back and still have showdown value, right? Against that sizingor is calling most of his four x nine x queen x and then you just lose but if he i mean etienne and my eyes can jam the river if he wants right then it's like the play makes somewhat sense but here just like going two thirds on that deuce to then check back never winning is kind of a waste of the properties of his hand. So yeah, nice winning that one. So it seems like we have a heads up going on now against Kevin. Let's try to focus on that a little as well and yeah. Very interesting small blind versus under the gun. 3-bet pot top there again ace-jack offsuit is not a thing against under the gun So it's just again definitely being too loose, but it's tough to play back against Fedor If you if you just see him pop up there. Yeah, I can just say okay That's probably the right counter a very very tough counter And obviously facing that race is just that should be a range consistent being consistent of like some ace kings and some pocket threes. I play without that raising range here to keep my range together. So this is always like just very, very player dependent and random often. Some players are full of shit all the time. Some players just have exactly ace king and not any bluffs. So it's just very, very, very, very tough and great to have strong reads, right folding ace jack here it's like if he i guess fedor's conclusion was that this guy has like pretty much only value hands and he would have won more if he just called the flop if he just like had the miracle bluff here good for him but yeah being that loose as fedor and then only calling off ace queen probably ace king is obviously big over folding and he could just be random with any two but that's usually not what's happening all right so let's see that bottom here the heads up I think that was a small flop c bet I mean what is it 125 125 to 50 so was like probably 75 no what is yeah 75 dollar bet going on in on the flop or on the turn. I'm not sure. I think the block bet here doesn't make too much sense. Unblocking all the two pairs that you want to get value from. I prefer a bigger size here and we can block bet or, or check those queen X that have a peer and therefore block two peers. so ace king of clubs i think this was a squeezed part three way top left the queen nine just hits us too good so i think we need to bet pretty much all of our ace kings there blocking king queen suited ace queen suited and yeah now i mean now it's just me we can't do much but check fold but i think we missed an opportunity there if i didn't misread the action and yeah let's see a little more what that hatsa will bring there
