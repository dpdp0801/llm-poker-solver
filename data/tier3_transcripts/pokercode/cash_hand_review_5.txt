### TOPIC: cash hand review 5
 All right, let's keep going. So next hand is the heads up that ace four offsuit. And Federer decides to use a big bet on that board, which makes quite a lot of sense. Ace four fitting in there somewhat, maybe folding out the first ace highs, cleaning his outs a little, having that backdoor straight that we see here that he follows up with a bet. And that five, I think forces him to just give up. Villain might still have ace three and ace four himself sometimes, might still have some queen jack, so jack nine. So actually we have some showdown value, which makes bluffing very, very, very tough, especially on a card that just improves Villain pretty much. Now I missed the action on the top left. I just assumed that that was a preflop call if not that would be very very light but yeah let's see okay Kevin having 10-4 just the top here Oh Fedor gave up a flush draw and gave him a recreational note for that 8 high check call on the turn. Alright that's the hand we want to go into definitely so turning straight is great it's an open race from Kevin and a check check on the flop so since Kevin is probably not checking back too many flush draws the 8 is just one of the best cards in the deck for Fador and this time he's having it obviously finding bluffs is not Tough since any Jack any nine anything like that qualifies for being a great bluff And now we need to find the mix right our nine six Jack nine obviously has only one goal Which don't get it wrong. The goal is not betting the goal is getting the maximum money in the middle Right. So if we are checking it looks like we have a seven or ace high and kevin starts value betting some hands and bluffing some other hands and we can bump it up them or we just build a polarized range with full shit and knotted hands and start betting very very big or bet normal to maybe get some raises if kevin improved to two pair to pocket aids to whatever so multiple plans can lead to the same goal and now it's our job to find the best best one to get the most money in so i can see anything from like betting normal to over betting to checking with a plan to check race let's see what fedor decides to be doing here and he goes for the super big I tell you I have super nuts now right the more than two times pot it's pretty much just saying hey Kevin you know what you never check back jack nine nine six or pocket eights here so if he was Fedor couldn't just like go crazy with that and yeah I see some trouble in being that polarized with those big sizes especially when being super deep just because the board can still change quite a lot and then there is room to play for Fedor is mainly just mentioning his hand strength right now so what does he do if the board pairs and he faces a 200 bb jam on the river against another What does he do if the board pairs and he faces a 200 BB jam on the river against another bet? What does he do if clubs come there? So it's really tough to find a balanced range that consists of all kinds of things to really then play a river that makes sense and that gets more or gets tougher and tougher the deeper we are in those spots. So unfortunately no extra money for the straight. Had some looks like a give up here which is high. King queen I think Fedor went for a check back on the flop. We can see that full range on that board if we want to but checking back with the hand like that definitely makes sense as well. Keeping the King tens and Queen tens in there that might fold just for that reason of hitting that King here and having the cooler on your side so if out of line now calls with the King eight of spades Fedor did everything right pretty much. And that check raise on the flush card is obviously not what he wants to see. A very interesting spot on the heads-up table here since Kevin decides to check back ace-7-7. Alright so we have a range split here which I mean makes sense he shouldn't see with all ace-axe. Kings do not want to check back but he needs to protect that with some check back stronger hands as well. Fedor will have lots of seven-axe and could attack now with very very very big sizings if Kevin is not protected enough. So that is a thought that comes up in mind. How would Fedor play 7x? It's a little you can compare it to the 9-6 straight spot we had just moments ago. And Jack-10 obviously qualifies as a nut gutshot pretty much to go a little crazy as well. It's the best gutshot that we can have and hitting a jack and a 10 can still have some value so something like check calling is not out of this world either we cannot bet everything but it's like an option to go through where we have the same thing do we check check call check raise over bet that and i think jack high this is just too weak to to get to showdown on such a great river card and getting the snap fold, having the club obviously helps. And now I love seeing Isidro Pereira join because he is a crazy player and yeah we'll definitely get some great three-handed action here. Is4 offsuit is not a call against the 3xaxe there, at least from what I know about about cash game charts, but yeah I expected him to call every single time here. Yeah pretty cool. I mean things might change slightly when deeper but yeah. Again same pattern, playing a little a little looser than than the book tells you. you you you so let's talk about that hand on that bottom right high-stakes table Fedor decided to go for a small bet the flop, which you can definitely do. This is a board that you can bet full range on. On the turn, we have the first very, very, very interesting decision because there we need to look at the properties of our hands. We are definitely value betting something like queen 10, jack 10, etc. We are definitely value betting some strong king x. We are definitely checking some weak king x do with some ace-highs and peers. So now the question is what is good for our hand? We have queen-jack, so we could either hit a queen or a jack. But after betting, that's not worth too much. If we bet big again, villain calls, he mainly has something like a king. So hitting that, we can definitely not value bet a river pair pair anymore which kind of kills our hand. On the other hand we have an open ended straight draw. So on a nine or an ace we have a pretty cool value bet to get even more money from 10 or from a king or from rivered ace. And we have that queen of hearts which allows us well to play it a little like a flush and have profitable bluffs on hearts on the river so this was the turn decision now we find different properties in our hand to do different things i can find reasons to bet i can find reasons to check figure decided to check here which should be totally fine and now on the river we again have a decision we should know what are our hands we are checking back on that turn. I would say something like pocket sevens, something like king five of spades, something like nothing nothing jack six of diamonds, something like ace eight of diamonds. And now it's checked to us and we need to evaluate what are our value bets, which sizing do we want to take with those and which bluffs do we add? So obviously the Queen of Hearts is kind of a trigger here and the main thing we are bluffing against is Ace high. I think that our Queen Jack should still have some showdown value. If villain has something like Queen 9 of diamonds it's not a mandatory river bluff. So yeah, maybe so I would see how this can be quite some over bluffing and then i can see that this sizing is kind of special are we repping a river flush are we value betting king five of spades like that i'm not sure what the overall thought process is there but we might be over bluffing and we might have some kind of sizing till that we play our king five a little differently. And actually, we don't have many flushes that we check back and river. So yeah, interesting spot to look out for what certain bet sizes mean, what certain patterns mean. And yeah, actually great to get it through. I was hoping a little for the catch to see a hand and have like the fancy ace high call maybe. But yeah, nice hand. But interesting, like nice hand in the sense of lots of things to think about a big turn decision multiple river decisions bluffing yes no sizing which one etc you So let's have a look at the pocket jacks up there. We can see that high frequency and now the turn having the decision. Our street is like, yes, one street definitely, two streets close. And then the question is, do we take the second street on the turn? Or do we check back to potentially catch rivers or have another value bet against jacks? That's what's happening. We're definitely getting called by the king and here it's just very very very close and a mix seems seems totally fine i like the betting a little more when there's lots of connectivity cards like there was where a villain has like the pierce plus gut shots a lot that wouldn't pay a river bet necessarily and i like the check a little more when that is not the case and i have a clear catching hand. So yeah I was fine with either way running into a better hand there obviously happens even though we were value betting. So yeah, maybe doing a quick cut here to just have like the first moment for reflection. So now I watched a good amount of footage of Fedor playing live on stream. And I want to try to evaluate that a little like as let's say his cash game coach. right so if we want to tell fedor now where to improve or what did he do great right this is now what i would go with right we have a big thing pre-flop right we have sizings that do not really make sense for for like yeah the three batting out of position part there and way way being way way way way too loose that can work when playing one session people being a little scared it can even be a great exploit against the pool but definitely something i want him to be aware of right so fedor if you're listening to that and you want to dig deeper into cash game to play that more regularly this is is something people will spot definitely. Preflop stats were hands you see very, very early and then it's easy to play back correctly. So be aware of whether you are too loose or not and then adjust that. We have seen that small blind versus cutoff king jack off three bet. We have seen the small blind versus under the gun ace jack off three bet. We have seen the pocket threes small line versus button against very good players so this is something we have seen the five two suited from the button open race so all those little things add up to an overall picture and everyone will know after a couple of hands that you're just like too loose overall and when those players are really good players they can adjust and your weakest hands are just minus cv in the end so let's be honest this was far off from chart poker let's rate that let's go with the rating that lots of players use so let's give him a 6.5 out of 10 for that pre-flop game that's very very easy to improve a little or maybe he was just consciously exploiting two tight players that are scared of him and then it's obviously perfect but from the technical side let's give him a 6.5 out of 10. So far from what I've seen post-lock I like pretty much all I've seen right the batting or not batting decisions I didn't disagree with anything pretty much and then the bat sizing decisions I would say maybe a little i call it two sizing triggered by hand just looking at the hand and then doing what it wants to do exact that makes it very easy after some time to create some patterns and read you on certain hands so for a short session again that is perfect for getting a cash can player and really playing that every day that's a little dangerous and yeah maybe thinking a little more about the overall range like maybe not going too polar with like 200 percent pot bets stick it to 140 150 percent in those spots where you used it to to make it easier for yourself to have like a wider range that has a variety of things. But actually, right, this was just everything I've seen made sense. I loved especially seeing when you changed your first instinct from just wanting to snap click something or just going with your mouse over it and then reconsidering and making actually, most the time or all the time better decision and coming up with that one. So shout out to that very, very, very good play there. I'll rate the post-flop from the footage I've seen here with a, with a pretty, pretty strong 9.1 didn't expect anything else. So yeah, let's keep going. Maybe we see some more interesting things and we have a, have another rating going on at some point Let's start talking about that hand against Isidro here on ace-king-3 pocket eights. If we. If we look that board up in a solver, it uses a check or a big-bat strategy. And the reason is that Villa doesn't have ace-king, not kings, not aces, but lots of hands that can catch up. Any ace-axe can be a two-pair on the turn. Any queen-jack, queen-ten, jack-ten, all offsuit in Villa's range can make a straight. So this is why we want to charge that or are not interested, we are not interested too much in denying equity from something like six, seven of hearts. So I'm not sure what the small bet accomplishes on the flop actually. And yeah, obviously banking the river is great. Betting the turn is not an option. So a flop, I would be a little more interested in what is your overall plan there, how to play that board. And yeah, then seeing a river facing a bet on a brick would have been very interesting with that hand type obviously as well ace queen offsuit up there i think this was a yeah bet flop over bad turn check back river i hope you did not really consider value betting that river on the three flush run out but yeah very nice hand pretty standard as well interesting that you chose like 110 120 percent turn bet sizing but that was like a clear clear read or something that you just chose with that type of hand or you do that with like a real range and yeah pocket jacks nothing to talk about he snapped it down there snap check back against that recreational player that we have seen calling random hands with a tie and stacking off flush draws with queen x suited in three bad parts or something so just checking back that queen high board catching against random shit super standard So nice, loving it, how much it hurts him to click the button there with a 6-2 suited. Let's actually go back five seconds. That was more than five seconds. But still, and what I'm doing right now is just going slower. Not slow motion, but like back to normal speed. Let's watch. This is what we talked about in the last rating. Someone is too loose preflop. He open-raised 5-2 suited from the button. And here, okay, we have a shorter stack in the big blind. We have a regular in the small blind. What's our decision? Call, fold, raise, raise, call, fold. And then in the end making the correct decision, but you see the pain in his face. How can you fold a suited hand on the button? Alright, anyways, let's speed up again. Let's get some cool hands in. Not too interested in 6-2 suited folds even though I'm happy to see them. 6-5 offsuit definitely fine to iso against the limp. Very interesting to see as well that some players here are playing with limps, some others are playing without. It's like testing all the strategies we need to know about. very interesting to see for me that kevin sighs down on the button being Being 200 big blinds deep, he went with three big blinds. And now, yeah, 160 big blinds deep, he goes with, what was it, 135, 2.7 big blinds. So adjusting, you can really see they're adjusting either to the quite aggressive player in the small blind, Isidro, or just to the stack death now that he's playing. you So maybe bottom right interesting with a turn two pair in a limp pot calling the min bet on king eight five now turning a two pair on a on a board where straight is possible and if people are playing limping strategy six seven will be in there so we are not not nutted here obviously having super strong hand but i like to see how he uses a normal size they are still in that spot not over betting right away and now i think it's a great spot to go like about like 150% for value there. There are plenty of ace highs that should still be in Isidro's range, not many better things. So yeah I think we have quite some good value there and now even more like Isidro wrapping like the range bet, ace jack, check call turn because it's too strong to fold. The typical size up there, having it pretty nice but potentially a nice play by Isidro as well. What does Fedor do with like king-nine, king-seven? It's like probably investing those extra 135 dollars, losing to an ace all the time, or is Fedor having the correct bluffs? Tough to find here, but pretty cool to see those kind of non-standard lines when watching higher stakes here. Fedor is still going for the race only in the small blind. Different strategy there. Betting ace, jack, check is definitely fine with full range, so four or five suited is part of it. Now one of the worst cards, worst hands to continue on the turn. You can play like ace-5, ace-4 now, try to fold out some king-highs, queen-highs. I would prefer a block bet, but given that any sizing is fine, a give up can be fine as well. There, it's more about mixing in the bluffs and knowing your value range. Do not like to somewhat hit the frequencies correctly. Pocket six is sometimes called sometimes fold. So yeah, we're liking to see those folds that he didn't do in the first part of the tight folds so yeah two interesting hands going on at the same time that's 7-3 do sport you want to see bad with a bigger size usually just to attack over cards a little more and yeah that Queen seven there obviously a top here again a little bit decision we had before with jacks on king nine five seven something like that here you can check it back you can bet it on the turn you have two streets of value when to take it is the question so having that seven makes it quite nice well actually for both options i think it will always be a mix in a way, but interesting to see how he decides here. Just like in the moment. What we've spotted quite sometimes now already is Fedor using big bet check bet lines, we have seen a bet check and then a slight overbet on that King 10, 10 something with a river flush board. Here just going pot on the river, facing obviously a very, very large race, where now I want to scroll back there just to make sure we consider that the sizing here is very, very important. So Fedor decides to bet pot size, which doesn't allow him to go super super super thin for value and now it's important to know your own range. After checking back on the turn you have the problem that you did split your range. You probably never have jack nine or nine seven and this is what Isidro can attack with very very big sizes now. Let's just assume that if Isidro is bluffing right let's say he's bluffing he is risking $2,500 more or less to win $900. That needs to work out very very often to be profitable. So this is something you want to consider here. And not just look at your hand and not look at the size. Then it would be easy to say I have a queen, that's okay, a seven blocks is straight so I'm blocking nuts so it, right? This is something. And then maybe we end up calling 50-50. Where in the end, villain needs way more fold equity. So here, I think it's often the risk to be calling too often and not realizing how much villain is risking. And now being aware of your own range, are you ever checking back and trap some nuts? What is the best and weakest hand to your value betting here? All right, we have river pocket fives we're definitely calling that villain might have just a two pair. We have maybe, I don't know, are we value betting pocket jacks and this is might this actually be the better call just blocking jack nine? Tough to say right but I want everyone to to always know okay what it's like how does your range look like to in the end somewhat hit the correct frequencies not overfall too much especially against very very good aggressive players like one we are facing here or to just like yeah call too often and then f maybe you have a villain who is just doing that for value and you're just donating money into him right very very interesting spot so again consider the. I like the short tank then deciding to go with a fold. Having an explanation to go with a call or even randomize something is totally fine there as well. It's one spot that can be over bluffed, can be value heavy, we just don't know. And have to look at our range instead. Now we have a switch. Fedor now starting to use the limp as well in the small blind first in a limp call ace six offsuit. And top left the recreational player donking so ace nine click very very very clear value raise but I don't need to comment too much on that. I would always go with another bet against all kinds of 8x, 7x, 6x, 5x to then probably take a safe river and check back. Definitely nicer than checking back, seeing a king or something on the river and potentially not getting the value. We have seen that guy was calling 8 high at some point before for just a gutshot. So definitely trying to get as much money in as possible as long as we are clearly at. And yeah, nice. Nice to see that even snap that there, not really thinking about it. 10-3 suited, very interesting hand. I think just like checking on monotone boards is the standard. It's just too easy to react for the guy in position. And now I'm not sure whether we have that big value bet here actually I think it's more of a half pot block bet hand but yeah Fedor goes for the little thinner 75% bet maybe that's true in a limp pot I'm not using the limp strategy there so I'm not not too sure about that probably it's just fine A very interesting board there with the 9-7. This is definitely not our board. This is a board we should definitely bet small on and very, very low frequency. Just Isidro has, we are deep. He has way more straights and he will have way more straights over time so that 9-7 suited is are we actually the cutoff I guess the other guy is not dealt in so it's it's still fine it's not okay from the cutoff it's a little better but yeah the stuff I said is just like giving Isidro a huge nut advantage actually and the nut advantage over time which just like means if there is a deuce if there is a four if there is an eight it's like all good cards for Isidro he has more of that stuff so actually it's Isidro who wants to build the pot by check raising aggressively and yeah there's not a single hand that Fedor wants to bet big like not his sets because he wants to bet them small protect his range you see draw check raises not his ear not his whatever right obviously it's fine to bet big with a hand that has as much nut equity as 9-7 suited but that's a kind of a logical flaw and that comes it's like a standard you see from tournament players because for 40 big blinds 60 big blinds and against wider ranges this is a board that you can act or you want actually to bet bigger on this is always the case when something like pocket jacks and tents is still considered something nutted which is the case when you just play 50 big blinds deep right happy to stack off jacks here right now get the money and now not later let's protect before they are since seven eight nine or if if we are playing with anti and villain has all kinds of bullshit 10-7 off suits right the range is just so wide that relatively he doesn't have too many nuts and you are more playing against 6x 5x 3x and air yeah then you can bet big as well right to just maximize your value against that but against tight ranges where relatively Isidro has quite a lot of sets here, he probably only has the low suited stuff. He has those straights. He will have more straights over time. You have big, big, big, big, big problem. So yeah, everyone feel free to solve a board like that. Put it in PioSolver, get Odin, check it out there. 150 big blind steep if that is the thing and try to find the big sizing and yeah so Fedor again here jack-10 suited he did call it against the three bet under the gun versus MP against someone who is probably three betting a linear range this is not a good idea because you are just very very very very very dominated villain will have queen jack suited king jack suited ace jack suited ace 10 suited king 10 suited pocket queens pocket jacks pocket kings pocket aces even when you hit something you're you're still in trouble when you hit two pair villain has all the straight draws against you when When you hit top-peer, villain has over-peers and better top-peers. When you hit a flush, okay that's a decent hand. When you hit 9-8-7, villain won't stack off. So yeah, that's a very very bad hand to continue in exactly those positions here. So yeah, this is something we learned as well through pre-flop solves mainly that something like 4-5 suited is actually cooler. Hitting boards that villain does not hit and you can put some pressure on. Obviously everything I say is not too interesting when you just turn a flush. So seeing this donk here... Yes maybe if you donk here I would go smaller because you want to attack something like king ten10 of hearts. I'm not sure but the flush Changes equity so much that you want to implement a donking range the six Yes, six five six seven suited you might check raise that sometimes on the flop not the biggest game changer So it's yeah, it's easy to do that when you have the flush But would be interesting to ask Fedor now for the bluffs he actually had in that spot I think that was just again not again but like just playing his hand while trying to run away and looser from the button and we can loosen up as well but I am just mentioning it for the for the pattern that we are seeing here with just being not just slightly too loose with just being too loose in all the spots talking just about preflop Haven't seen too much loose crazy stuff postflop. And shout out to Nebo who is just jumping into the picture here. you okay so queen six suited interesting whether he considers a small bet at some point there. After checking I think he has a clear call even though I'm not expecting to see too many bluffs. And yeah, the Jig folding river, just what it is. All right. Alright, so bottom there, big blind versus hijack versus an unknown player, check check, obviously ace the worst card in the deck. Now, yeah, expecting him to play his hand strength, going for the donk bet there, exactly what we see. Ace six, okay. going for the donk bet there exactly what we see a6 okay a very interesting board there i mean quite a high check raising frequency there especially deep just like with that the the straight advantages I just talked about where Fedor used a big size against Cedro on a somewhat comparable board even though there was a flush draw and now yeah Fedor could just take over control and will have the big advantage in most runouts against the button not too much because he has fancy hands as well but against uh like cut off or hijack that is that is even more the case and there yeah against the check back is that i think i'm not sure about the action there with the seven six just heads up i think a check back from kevin and then anbet on the turn, followed up by a river give up when nothing got there. Queen is one of the worst cards in the deck for Fedor. And now facing that annoying quarter pot bet that you can't do anything against. against and now we see the 6-2 suited open race that he was yeah he was thinking about before on the top right 1k table now going for it here with clearly stronger players so yes again someone likes to be very very loose A6 suited definitely fine to 3-bet sizing-wise. You have multiple options there in position depending on your game plan, whether you play with calls or 3-bet only. So yeah, ace-8-4, fine board obviously with a backdoor nut flush draw with a top pair, small bet. Attacking all kinds of broadways is definitely fine attacking something like all kinds of peers is pretty cool and super standard now seeing a small this is a very small check race just like Isidro himself now attacking Fedor's random broadways maybe his his peers like something like pocket jacks pocket tens, all of those hands need to call against that sizing pretty much. The hands he should use mainly is obviously he's representing ace-eight suited, pocket eights, pocket fours, something like five-six, six-seven suited. It's a little unfortunate to block the bluffs here, the main bluffs, if he goes all the way, but something like seven-eight, four-five as well, something like pocket fives, pocket sevens, pocket sixes are optional check raises here so yeah we go from there definitely continue with the with our hand and see what the turn brings turn being a jack should be a pretty pretty good card for us because we have all the pocket jacks we have ace jacks so obviously Isidro can go still go for stacks easily with his sets. But his two-pair already decreased in value slightly. And yeah, so he checks, which is interesting as well. I guess pocket eights, pocket fours just keep firing most of the time. And draws, this can be a give-up with something like five-six, six-seven. This can be four-five, seven-eight, not going for it. And yeah, the very, very rare super trap with something like pocket 8s. And yeah, now rubbering 2-peer makes us very, very happy. Let's see what happens. Nice, we take the standard hotkey, size up by $100, which is again, keep that in mind. This is something that lots of recreational players or as well, Rex are doing just sizing up when they have it. I think if Fedor was just bluffing here, he didn't add, he wouldn't add those hundred dollars, so maybe a clear read on him here and let's see what happens next. right, so facing a jam now. So this is now we talked about it in another spot before we need to evaluate the sizing. This guy is risking six thousand three hundred dollars to win two thousand nine hundred seventy three dollars. So this needs to work quite often if he was bluffing. Now the main question for us is what is he actually repping? So we think about his value bets and then we will think about his potential bluffs. To have a value bet here he has two options pretty much. He check raised the flop and had like a hand that is okay to check raise there and then he needed to decide to trap on the turn. Something like pocket eights, trapping the turn. I don't know whether that happens often. This is what he's representing. Or he was check-raising the flop, giving up on the turn, hitting a miracle river, which, well, means he has pocket sixes. Or given Fedor's size, seven-five suited exactly. Fedor's pre-flop size was pretty small so I can see someone defending 7-5 suited there this is what he is representing now the optional bluffs we have something that check raise the flop as a bluff check check puts Fedor now on a like weak value hand and goes crazy this could be 5-6 this could be be six seven this could be pocket fives this could be pocket sevens this could be four five this could be seven eight or this could be any other random bluff that decided to check raise the flop and then gave up on the turn and looking at that now the question is okay how likely is it that villain bluffs one of those potential bluffs and how likely is it that he has those value hands and now weighting those up against each other is the one option right making a decision i believe he's bluff heavy i believe he's value heavy or not caring about the whole thing there and just playing your rage and then thinking about how often can i fold and just call your best hands. What we playing like that ace queen ace ten ace six and what is the best hand to call off here well probably the two pair so just saying okay probably ace six if I do not have too many trapped aces is my best hand here so this is a mandatory call if not-folding. So yeah, I would always call here quite happily because I don't see the Isidro story checking out. It needs to be like a check-raise for value with a super small sizing, then deciding to give up or like to trap. Yeah, to trap and then go crazy. Or it needs to be like the miracle river at nuts, which is pocket sixes or the super random seven five suited um yeah let's see what Fedor decides and i just can't see him folding i mean still if someone is playing six some frequency. He has equity drawing to some kind of backdoor nuts yes a nine is okay but like that's about it right on the queen he doesn't want to go crazy on a turn queen yes a flush draw but then he's running into all kinds of ace acts of hearts it's like something different so which cards are actually good for him to be bluffing right it's like it's the nine or a good card? Not really, because his range doesn't improve on those cards. This is why you want to have five, six, four, five, seven, eight, where you improve when actually villain has trouble on those cards. So I think this jack ten, yeah, turned then a jack, and then thought about it after seeing the river. Just like having a two-peer and set blocker that doesn't make too much sense here. It's easy to say that now after calling the river magic two pair what to do if we have ace 10 on the river what to do if we have ace queen that we might play that way so yeah it's it's it's obviously very very very tough play but i call those scenarios those black or white scenarios people are not hitting frequencies they are either super crazy and likely over bluffing or they are not creative at all and just do that when they have that river at hand right and this is something i try to spot very very early and make notes on those player types and yeah i think the way that isidro shows he is thinking in that in that hand just shows that he might be over bluffing all kinds of spots. Yeah, pretty cool and interesting hand. Yeah, now actually just for you guys, I put it in the sim with my own ranges that is like won't be anywhere close to what Fedor and Isidro are playing here. Stack death is not correct, I just did it very very very quickly on the go to just have a look and and maybe see whether that is correct what I was talking about right. So here I was just like this is a very very tight range that is not correct for that spot because this one is solved for a ZOOP500 rig for different sizes but so on. But I still want to show you guys what we see here. And even though the whole picture is a little odd now, I think you can still see that. That, well, what I described. Pocket 8s want to check raise. Pocket 4s like to check raise. Pocket 5s, 6s, 7s are optional check raises with a backdoor straight draw, with a 2-outdoor to a set, 5, 6, 7, 6, as well as something like 8, 9 suited, 5, 4 suited with those pairs. I didn't even mention deuces and threes. They have a 2-outer to a set plus the backdoor straight draw as well. Something like jack, 10 of hearts is just not really a thing. So sorry, I think my picture is above that right now. So we have the jack ten of hearts here, which is just not really a thing. So sorry I think my picture is above that right now. So we have the jack ten of hearts here which is just yes it's not really that this is the solve for that spot but we see a pattern which hands are interesting here. So let's just click that through quickly. I didn't even I mean Isidro was check raising smaller than that so that's not really the point here we had an offsuit jack on the turn and then that jack 10 okay it is check or bet it doesn't exist what does it mean whatever it goes check check river is a freaking six any kind of six and yeah we check our jack that we shouldn't ever really have it's like yeah i mean didn't solve it it's more about the flop right and then fade our bets check bet the sizes are not correct so let's let's let's forget that and talk about that flop strategy and this is what i just wanted to showcase you that well understanding how the flop strategy should look like and then seeing that hand is enough for me in that spot to just say like, okay, it's very, very likely that that guy is just very creative and somewhat crazy and wants to go for it. And this just would mean that sometimes it's the right time to close the eyes and click that call button. And this is now what we wanna do going forward. Top right is very very very interesting. Fedor did flat blind versus small blind, faced double barrel with his flush draw. And now on the river, we have a one card straight. So now the big question is bluff or no bluff. And we definitely have some jack-ex. We have queen-jack, we have king-jack, we have jack-ten, we have ace-jack, and we are value betting obviously all jack-ex. And the question is, what are our worst hands and therefore our best bluffs and i think this 10-6 of spades makes the cut not really having showdown value obviously five x of spades are the first hands and yeah i would like to see a bluff here ah you see the the click on the check button and then now going for the sneaky, sneaky 40% bluff, just playing in snap folds. I don't think that that small sizing is that great. I'm just like, maybe he was value betting now is scared and then goes for the call. Maybe it's just the perfect sizing. We will never know, but I like going for the bluff all right another time to wrap things up a little and actually it stayed the same somewhat, right? Fedor Kapp being too loose. I've complimented him for some good folds, then we have seen the 6-2 suited from the button finally, we have seen the Jack-10 suited call against the three-bet in positions where this hand is really not really playable, So I got a hammer on him for those pre-flop mistakes. If that is not a conscious exploit then everything is fine. So I'll keep the rating of 6.5 for that and yeah post flop I haven't seen like any clear leaks right. He had some close decisions where multiple options are fine. We have seen some sizings that were probably different from the ones that I used so it would be interesting to talk about how he designs his range in those spots but definitely nothing wrong there. So this is what we usually see when players from like a different area jump into different games right their overall thought processes, pulse of everything can still still be very very great well i now remember the one sizing mistake on that one flop that i could just like say hey i know this is coming from from mtt play there yeah let's for that mistake let's let's lower the pro the post-flop rating i think i gave him the 9.1 9.2 something like that last time let's give him an 8.7 this time but yeah really really good what i see there while we talk about that as well seeing actually kind of clear mistakes from his villains as well and we've we're playing some some pretty good high stakes players here yeah i'll wrap it up here for the next part when i have a look at fedor's cash game skills
