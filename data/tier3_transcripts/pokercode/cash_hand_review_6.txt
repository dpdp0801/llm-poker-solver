### TOPIC: cash hand review 6
 All right, let's go. Next part of the little cash game review series of Fedor's cash game here. Yeah, let's just jump right into the action. We are seeing two NL 5k tables, a little heads up on the bottom left that just started, a nice ring game table on the bottom right, and two additional NL 1k tables up there. As before, I will just comment on the action. Feel free to cut out the highlights, or let just see what what's happening Yeah, maybe first interesting spot Fedor's 4-bet down here So now I'm not sure whether that just started whether that is kind of a thing going with a flow of just EF 4-betting like first spot or something But definitely a hand that makes sense in some 4-betting strategies're sizing pretty fine. So unfortunately we don't see a hand evolving, but yeah, definitely fitting to the little looser approach that Fedor went for the whole time. And yeah. Top right with that set against the nut flush draw. Not really that interesting of a hand, just calling flop, pretty standard with a set here. Yeah, we'll speed up a little here. All right, so bottom left, interesting, probably the heads up, 7, 8 on that board. It's like not out of this world to continue, but just slightly too weak. Well, bottom right, maybe very interesting hand here against, I don't know the name, so potentially a recreational player sitting there with 50 big blinds, checking back a a is a very that you can see that a very high frequency on so usually that just like tells you something that it's like specific hands if you have nothing nothing on that board people usually see the board structure and just decide to see that very high frequency if you have something like ace four of spades so usually this is a typical spot where you get triggered by your hand and a check back especially as a recreational you have like a 10 or you have pocket nines or you have pocket eights so given that thing and this is something i like a lot and i'm sure fedor does the same it's just yeah really not really playing versus a range that makes sense but just putting people on like a certain hand category and trying to play your hand max EV We're looking at that now villain will call any 10 against a big sizing villain will call something like 9s and 8s Might maybe still have something like ace 9 ace 8 check back which somehow connects with the board and has equity So yeah, I like seeing a big bet here now and then depending on the river card maybe going for another very thin big river bet or just going for the block bet depending a little on the run run out so i'm really really interested in seeing what's happening now we see that you see like that was not even a hotkey was like 175 into 275 like somewhat downsized Biggish bet there just like attacking exactly what he wants to attack and now I Think I still love to see a block bet it feels a lot like a check But if we really nail down people on hands, it's still the ace looks scary But it should be be more like nines, eights, ten x. Obviously ace ten can be a thing, but I'm not scared of facing bluff raises from like that type of recreational player. And yeah, very interested to see how that one goes. And seems like he's opting for the check check. We see exactly the hand I put villain on. I never have seen that footage before so it's it it fit really really well here and yeah maybe like maybe a tiny mistake i would say on the top left we are seeing a spot where fedor is in a three bad pot on a 996 paired board where villains shouldn't have too much. If this is a good villain, he shouldn't defend 10-9, 9-8 suited too often against a high-frequency 3-bet there just because it's too dominated by other hands, 10s, 9s, Jack-10s suited, King-10s suited. So you prefer to have like 4-5 suited. So it's like kind of a brickish board and then those you want to leverage the advantage you have right now having jacks queens kings aces and mainly want to choose a big sizing this is different in the tournament world where defending ranges are way wider given the ante that is in the middle and not paying rig so yeah this is like usually a bigger c-bet strategy is favored by the solvers on that type of board. I see totally where this is coming from. What is happening here is just that well villain sees next cards for too cheap. He shouldn't actually adjust too much by raising but it's kind of an offer. You see more cards and more cards won't help Fedor range wise, a seven, an eight, a five. Even the queen king jack helps more villain to well know that he is probably behind with all his like tens, eight, seven. So it's more like seeing more information for too cheap of a price on a board where villains shouldn't have too much. So yeah Now maybe that's the like a hand to start with you're really at the beginning that that I do not really like how Fedor played it. So that I call him out of line that OOL guy decides to check raise against that small sizing. That's like not he used a small check raise to just attack over cards. Fedor has like an ace queen is obviously an okay calling hand. Having the ace of clubs is not necessarily great because it blocks villains backdoor nut flush draws that he might check raise but mainly villain is wrapping middle peers that want to go for protection villain could then follow up with like a block bet to still fight versus ace highs or to just check and get cheaply to showdown and now let's think about what could be villains check raise and then checking range if it's not a peer and a peer is not check folding here so then it's more like something flush draw check folding could be something like queen jack of clubs queen 10 of clubs which Fedor is really dominating here 7-8 is not really check folding there ever I would say so I'm not sure how much sense Fedor's small bet on the turn makes it's more for me as i said i haven't seen the footage right now but i expect to always see pocket eights now in a way maybe some ace jack of diamonds okay then we have a cool thin valley bet on the turn and have seen a very weird check race by villain on the flop but yeah i don't think that that whole strategy is sound by fedor and we see like i understand where it comes from not understanding how tight cash game ranges should be in that spot so let's see what the result was really really interested in seeing hands seven six of clubs so this is pretty much the same thing like pocket eights in a way additional backdoor straight draw backdoor flush draw it's just like not check calling I think the theory play is to mainly check call that hand make use of seeing the cheap term getting more information the information here would be that villain does not improve on that four villain being fedor in that perspective then it usually goes check check against lots of ace highs and out of line has a block bet on the river to make ace highs indifferent to calling or folding so yeah this hand played out a little differently just because I think both players took a let's say let's call it a lower frequency path and yeah it just shows the I don't know misinterpretation of the spot maybe by Fedor comparing to the tournament world. Yeah very very very interesting to dive a little deeper into that. so next spot that I actually like to see on the bottom right table. Fedor has 5-3 suited on the cutoff which is obviously out of this world regarding open raising but we have seen that face up recreational player with his queen 10 before so yeah against that guy maybe you want to widen our range i think still this is definitely too loose i'm not sure how tight the guy on the button is this 18 vpip shouldn't tell us too much for now we have very good play in the small blind but the small one usually cannot adjust too much just being in the worst position but what i would like to see here is mainly widening our range around high cards. We are playing 40 big blinds against the big blind. He might be just too loose, calling off, playing face up, never folding mid pairs, top pairs. And then our 5-3 suited is a draw to straights and flushes, which are hands that rather want to play for more than 40 big blinds. So that 5-3 suited, in is just too weak if he adds something like king 8 offsuit here i'm actually totally fine right that's a hand that can get the value out of this type of player i'm like guessing a little player type by just seeing one hand and having information that he plays 40 50 big blinds and yeah but this 5-3 suited seems just like he is widening his range because of that type of player but actually that type of player might mean that he loses more on boards like that because we don't have the fold equity we need so now he ends up with a nut blow yeah has the chance to blast off a stack no one knows whether that is a profitable bluff or not where the villain is just always sitting on all kinds of queen eggs and never folding actually i like to see fedor sizing down here not going for the overbet jam i'm overbet like 115 120 percent pot so yeah it's really yeah just like trying to fold out some six seven that call on the turn but this is what i already talked about when when thinking about the open race here that this is maybe more leading to problems right if you know that this guy is sticky sticky and then always believes you on the river that's a different thing but i think he didn't have that read or couldn't have that by the time. All right, so next hand I want to focus on is this 8-4 suited here. Again, on that 5k table where we play. Yeah, this is a defend. It's close versus good players. So it has to be fine against somewhat face-up recreationals. So we have seen that snap check back with the smith pair now facing a large bet on that type of board it's like all alarm bells ringing it's really here okay this guy has to have something we're damn we have a top here but i definitely don't want to check raise here which you could think about given the stack death but yeah it's probably call re-evaluate turn being ready to make some big top pair folds for that stack death but yeah peter considering the small race yeah i just really don't like it now he is priced in and it's like villain is betting big on 873 he has shown us his face up before I actually think this is a straight up punt. So let's go for our first big rating for the five minutes. Or just like that hand. Yeah, I have to call this a straight up punt here against a recreational player. Not knowing the patterns, I would have guessed he knows those type of players very, very well from the tournament world. facing them way more often. This was more like maybe a solver play that he played versus someone who just told him on the flop that he has it. Even the speed he put out, the big sizing. I wouldn't have hated a flop fold, even if it sounds really, really weird, right? It's just villain telling you his hand, more or less, which means he has ace eight plus is what he said maybe queen eight plus so yeah getting it in there with probably no fold equity against the big sizing with something like 20 is just not the greatest idea and this is definitely a donation to the to the recreational player here so yes so far last five to ten minutes to lose pre-flop not understanding that one three bet pot. I mean, it's not enough preflop to rate it, but it goes with a pattern I've seen before. Like let's go with a six out of 10. And for that straight up punt, I mean, he has some equity, so it's not full, full garbage, but this is definitely like a 2.5 out of 10. And if I see that from my students, I'm just'm just saying like yeah I prefer the flop fold over that race and calling reevaluating turn is probably the play given the equity we're having you you you All right, a couple of interesting hands going on now. Let's try to have a look at both of those hands at the same time so the top left 7-8 suited standard cutoff open raise we face a flat from the button and a big blind flat as well and then on that flop Fedor decides to check snap check pretty much which means he's probably checking full range maybe batting something around like strongest seven pocket tens pocket jacks doesn't to have some protection but this is yeah mainly the big blinds board not sure about how well the button does depends a lot on on how exactly his sliding range looks like so i like the check here a lot and then following up against a yeah bigish standard sizing it's not a block bed it's not really big like a standard sizing following up with a yeah weakest seven or like i mean we have six seven as well but one of those with a passive line by just calling and then re-evaluating on the river and then probably raising depending on the sizing that villain chooses villain can easily still have all better sevens villain can value bet all kinds of nine x can have all kinds of draws where it's really nice that we have the 8 as a kicker, which, well, gives us a boat when Villain completes to some straights. That's pretty great. Bottom left, we have a monochrome board, king-7-4 all clubs, button versus big blind after having a standard open raise with ace-7. Going for a third pot c-bet. Very interesting how you want to play those flush boards. I always say like, okay, you use smaller sizes and play them normal played like king seven four rainbow just take smaller sizes and then all of a sudden at some point turn river we we pretty much get into the flush zone and then it flushes and blockers all that matters so it could be and that we end up all in with just because we have the ace of clubs and until then we go somewhat normal just big sizes do not make sense because everyone is super protected by having flushes you can play that standard sizing i would like to even use a smaller one gives kevin a little more trouble in that spot with all his random queen 10 off suits but yeah definitely a fine play both i like them and let's let's see how it continues very interesting so we get great turn and river cards here so the river first of all villain checks and i mean this should be mainly just to give up he has more seven than fedor in theory he should maybe he can have some check raises against slow played over pairs but mainly he should take over the initiative himself and nine can still go for a normal size value bet or even maybe just a block bet so i expect this canadian guy on the top left pretty much always giving up and i want to use just one sizing there there's still some risk of getting check raised. So I'm using kind of a standard sizing here where I value bet still my kings maybe. Obviously something like ace nine and a seven obviously as well to be protected. When I face large raises that could come every now and then. Bottom left, same thing. Let's play it kind of standard as if there was no flush until a certain point so that seven sure is a good card for kevin but it's not like changing nuts because the flush is out there and yeah we have the nut seven here in a way we can we definitely want to bet that and yes small bet big bet both can make sense we are incredibly protected by having that ace of clubs as well bad can happen. We have a very strong hand We don't want to trap this one and get the maximum money in against something like Bill might have 7-8 before a fourth club is out there. So yeah, I Like pretty much any sizing on the top left. I definitely like to see a normal size because there's not too much air we are really wrapping so yeah this just i'm i'm snap folding any catcher here and this year yeah i mean it really depends on what this guy is stabbing with but i don't see too many catchers that we are attacking so i don't like over batting here too much yeah i think it's easy to just over fold everything i don't find bluffs that that fedor could ever have here so yeah pocket fives is just okay it's just this yeah not a straight up but but some kind of a of a punt by villains definitely the call off on the river is a punt i have no clue what he's calling against maybe some jack tens that's that's about it i mean fedor was calling the turn with someone behind that has all the pockets pocket fives in the first place is too weak for that kind of biggish normal size value bet on the turn to then yeah it's that's that's yeah fedor fedor was definitely on the better end of that and this is not not a well-played hand, I guess. And yeah, that a7 turned out to be very, very interesting because Kevin decided to take the lead on that 7, which is obviously a pretty great card for him, just because of two things, right? He has more 7s after calling. This is the one thing. And the other thing is that all of Fedor's c-bats did not furtherly improve, right? Fedor has has something like queen 10 of spades, which Kevin is folding on the flop. And this did not improve. So the 7 is giving Kevin new strong hands. And at the other hand, giving Fedor no new strong hands at all. Just besides the few 7s. And this plays more of a role just because Kevin doesn't have those hands anymore. anymore because he folded them on the flop something like 9 10. so he's using a small sizing to really challenge those type of hands like something like a random 9 10 that might still have equity against the four that has equity against an ace high with the club so it makes a lot of sense to use a size like that and now fedor is kind of a decision to make yeah definitely raising here should be the play maybe slow playing sometimes to call I'm not a big fan of that that deep as I said before we want to get the maximum amount of money in against that freaking seven that Kevin is I mean he's not wrapping only a seven by donking small but he could have it river is a brick there should be some flushes in kevin's range so yeah this i think we go for a kind of a standard bet we can maybe over bet slightly they are all options just the the flush and the and the paired board gives us so many opportunities i think i don't like the over bet too much that block bet is very very interesting i think here this is more exploitative play. Really Kevin putting Fedor on some kind of hand that wants to check back very often. Just given the run out that 10 does not change anything. So I really don't see that donk being like a really kind of range wise thing that happens really really often i can see that just being king 10 going for max value against king x from fedor being a weak seven that on the one hand doesn't want to face a big race but still wants to deny the check back of fedor's aces and ace king i would yeah i would read into that like being that kind of a face up and maybe some super nuts like a 710 of diamonds can do some fancy things but yeah i think this this is more an exploitative thing where fedoras is usually it's not usually but in this case on the better end of it and yeah Let's already have a look at those pocket tens, big hand that is coming up there. So I haven't seen it before, but someone told me the timestamp that there is a big hand evolving. So let's have a look at those tens while Kevin decides to make a probably good fold. We have pocket tens on that queen nine six board, calling that small flop bet first thing to think about is what i don't know villain here actually he sits down with 200 bigs which is yeah assigned for being a rather good player maybe that wants to cover some weaker player on the on the table and yeah so that guy is now three betting from the big blind so three bang from the big blind if you know how ranges should look like there there's lots of kind of polarized part weaker hands in it something like king six suited suited aces maybe some suited queens as well even something like king 10 king jack offsuit sometimes from those positions and yeah so this is very very interesting to see here and to evaluate right so if people are having those hands well then tens are great on that board if people are not having those hands and they rather play like the value part of it which is more like jacks plus ace king well then all of a sudden we are playing against ace king only so this is the first evaluation that i try to make in this spot when i look at certain villains where here unfortunately i have no clue so let's try to play somewhat close to a solver and now let's see how the how the hand plays out calling standard call on the flop now i'm proving to a double gutter on the turn facing a big bet so this is now first thing we can see this is a 75% hot hot key we have a double gutter we have a peer villain might have pocket kings which already that 200 big blinds deep villain shouldn't be ready to stack off kings right it's like we just improved to jack 10 suited we improved to 9 8 we still might have that deep 5 7 suited sometimes we have all kinds of hearts we have obviously the sets pocket nines pocket eights pocket sixes that do not necessarily need to raise the flop so yeah king's aces cannot go directional in with it with that sizing they can bet this now to then block bet later or whatever so yeah by seeing that hotkey this could still mean everything but it's definitely on that card that improves the cutoff by quite a lot a sign of strength and only a few hands maybe make good bluffs there as well so our hand has no option unfortunately i mean unfortunately fortunately makes it easy right just calling hoping for some kind of hit or give up by villain or maybe a good candidate to jam over block bets and now we have a very very very interesting card so let's first think about turn action again what might villain have king's aces going for value on the turn and then depending on the river going for value there as well but probably not for stacks that would be too thin maybe something like nines itself jack 10 suited obviously is a good option and then the next question which bluffs could villain have this comes now brings it all back to what is his three bad range in the first place does he have something like well i would say his bluffs can be ace king obviously playing the same way like aces and kings preferably having a heart with it just, just like on that heart flush or turn, blocking continuing range, having options on rivers like those, and then mainly suited hands, right? If you have random suited hands that you are three betting, something like king five of hearts, why not going for a turn bet? Something like ace five, ace seven of hearts was possible on the turn, not anymore in that river. Ace 10 of hearts-10 of hearts, King-Jack of hearts. And yeah, very, very interesting. This is what we expect. So on that river, I think we are expecting lots of checks. That's a great river for us since we have all Queen-X of hearts, all Six-X of hearts. We have all Ace-Jack, Ace-10 of hearts. We have lots of just 10-X that are calling pocket 10s, 9-10 suited, that are all calling on the turn. And it should be, I mean it's probably a range check for villain but a high frequency check on that very very bad river card for him. And now we see this here. So I've just tried to explain that we have probably more 10x than villain. It's like we get there with pretty much any 10 that we continue with just by having a double gutter on the turn. We should have more flushes as well because we get to that river with all our flush draws. Villain could check queen x of hearts on the turn. He could decide to not c-bet something like king five of hearts on the flop. He could do, I don't know. So it's such a great card and still villain decides to over bet into us which means well he's forcing us to continue like 40 of our range only which i think we just have lots of flushes and straights so now the question is is this a sign of strength this is a sign of weakness what could that mean? Which bluffs could you have? So we can find ace-jack, ace-ten of hearts. We can find ace-king of hearts, maybe. We can find ace-five of hearts. Definitely those nut flushes, king-high flushes. Now is the question which bluffs can we find? We need offsuit hands to find bluffs here. That's the first big thing. Is Willem raising something like ace-jack off preflop? And every 10 makes a straight. That is not bluffing. So we need something like ace-jack or king-jack offsuit. And we obviously have ace-king. And then, well, the big question is, are those hands playing like that? I'm mainly thinking about the turn. They are all... I think ace-jack is just unlikely preflop. Never seeing it. It's not not a big part of that range anyways so ace king is the most likely hand that could do that being triggered by the king or ace of hearts on the river and yeah is that ace king c betting the flop yes most of the time probably is it with the heart betting the turn question mark if it gets to that river and now has like the ace of hearts king is it doing that yes pretty likely so this is what we are looking for and then we need to kind of even out with what are the potential value hands villains having so yeah this is from like the exploitative standpoint is he over bluffing is he under bluffing that spot he's representing a certain hand category which is freaking flush plus jack 10 is just running into all the flushes and tries to make a ten maybe even fold so obviously we have one of the best catchers that we can have a ten with a heart and this is now right where fedor definitely should go in the tank and think about well do i want to catch here at all or just fold all my catchers it's definitely not a fist pump snap call here villain is representing a stronger hand than a 10 and yeah i'm not sure what to think here i would like from my experience i'm saying people just have jacks plus ace king a lot and are usually missing the bluffs especially deep 200 big blinds deep from the big blind here what does that lead to if i just say villain has jacks plus ace king then there is one combination left that beats us and a couple of ace kings that are off suit right this is really just breaking it down making it as easy as possible but as easy as possible means at the same time it's very very likely that people think that way or do that high frequency i cannot say that he he is never 3-betting Kf5 suited here, right? Maybe he is, I don't know. But this is lots of ifs and I try to go with the high frequency things. And this is something maybe as a little advice for everyone that can help a lot. What is he repping? What is he likely playing? Which way start to end from the hand? And yeah, let's see. As I know Federer, I expect a big call and because I was told there's a big hand evolving you see how he's contemplating it and yeah. Now it's like yeah, as I told you guys I haven't seen the hand before, you need to believe that, but this is pretty much what we were looking for. And if we see the ace king of hearts we wouldn't have any information, it's just like yeah he had had it we still don't know how he plays the offsuit ace king but it's just very very likely that this line actually ends up being bluff heavy there but just in the way i tried to nail it down so i think fedor did that at that point deciding to go for the catch would have been interesting how he plays it without a heart tense without a heart whether he was more looking at his range or looking at villains range just like from an exploitative standpoint what is more likely what villain is doing etc So maybe the next interesting hand on the bottom left it is not a heads up hand but button versus big blind. Isidro went for just a small race so 8-6 off is a close defense sometimes maybe and then he decides to check back a board that is very very very favorable for him so ace king 10. Fedor turns gutshot and decides to not go for it and then we are on the river and Fedor sits there with like nothing nothing and no showdown value and still has the option to bluff or not to bluff and this is in my eyes again a very exploitative spot where some people are just like checking back king x and never check back air like four or five of spades to then bluff that on the river right now isidro should definitely have a river betting range himself and we he should include bluffs but to have a bluff here he needs to check that one on flop. That actually it's very likely that people end up with too much like showdown value type of hands and nothing else, which just means that any bluff from Fedor here would be minus CB. Obviously, we need to expect that people are very, very good on those stakes, and especially players like Isidro who play that every day. But this is something you can think about and make, which makes the spot interesting and seeing Fedor's decision to not bluff here shows something. And Isidro's showing with 9, 8 of spades shows something as well, that he knows how to check back garbage on boards like that, which is very, very great to see here for me because this is, let's say if you play NL 200 or NL 50 Sum, this is something you're just not seeing. not seeing you see the king 8 you see the 10x you see pocket queens and that's about it all right let's go with that king 10 suited bottom right it's not 100% 3-bet, but a high-frequency 3-bet. Definitely doable. Flopping top two, hoping for getting check-raised. Let's go. Turn 7, full brick. There's only one option, which is the big sizing direction all-in. See in here, taking the 66%, scrolling up a bit. That size is fit. Alright. Alright. percent scrolling up a bit that size is fit all right now let's actually scroll back to have a look at another interesting hand up there so top left Fedor is defending big blind versus middle position and he was facing a slightly over pot c-bet it was 50 into 45 on that ace king five boards this is something villain can do just because he has nut advantage right now and Fedor has lots of fans that have trouble defending against big sizes he has queen jack queen 10 jack 10 that are all chasing their gut shot and are kind of need to react to the price that is given to them federer has all the ace queen ace jack ace 10 ace 9 ace 8 ace 7 ace 6 ace 5 probably and has a problem right he's like villain is representing something stronger than ace jack let's say and the problem is that even the three outer might be just a draw to the yeah to the worst end of it right hitting a 10 when villain might have ace king already is a big problem hitting a 10 when villain might bluff queen jack is not great either so the first big decision we are having we can obviously not fall to a pot bet on the flop with our ace here. But the first big decision is on that turn. And we are facing another 120% pot bet. Villain clearly going direction all in, leaving like 150% pot behind for the river. And now the problem is how do we play not only our ace-10, but all our aces? Which hands do we prefer? And keep that in mind what I just thought about. We need need bluffs that villain gives up on the river that we don't want to block and we need to have equity that can still be value hands in the best case and or it doesn't like equity to not like to really hit the best hand not the second best and here i think it's good thing to mainly start overfolding those tens ace jacks they are indifferent here right now and they are not drawing to a good two pair right something like an ace eight hitting a two pair on the river is way way way nicer so here if you look this spot up in the solver it's already folding quite a lot of ace tens on the turn and yeah now it's the question how are things played out in the real world rainbow boards they are the flush draws missing that are usually giving up on the river so it's like i'm not finding the give up bluffs we really need to have like that seven eight eight nine queen jack jack ten and that is not going all the way possibly but if these are his bluffs at the same time then the ten as an out is really not that great but let's see it's already seen that Fedor ends up calling now we have this card here which will lead to probably very very high batting frequency via this shaker maker all right now you're nicely blocking jack 10 but, but villain is wrapping like ace-queen plus So how great is that which bluffs are you expecting to call and let's compare that spot to that ace-king We had that pocket 10 spot against ace-king off we had before really think about okay How likely is it that villain is doing that villain has ace-king? Starts doing that on the flop. He goes all's go 100 you can do that pocket fives easy you can do that very easy ace queen bad big over bet or like over bet over bet rivering top two more or less because villain cannot have ace king easy jack 10 bluffing all the way can't work maybe yes maybe no now finding the bluff seven eight is only a suited hand you start overbetting the flop maybe maybe not pocket fours pocket threes pocket deuces are you crazy enough to keep going on the turn maybe maybe not do you start where i would say right in that pocket 10 spot it was very very likely that villain just has that ace king offsuit they are not he's wrapping like two three four flush combos that he needed to have in the first place by start Starting to three bet them preflop who knows might be the case Maybe not but here it's like very very likely that villain plays every single value and he could have in that way and it's actually Kind of tough to find the right amount of bluffs when you're not super crazy going for all of it So I like to see a fold here tank fold. I would have liked to see a turn fold sometimes already as well. And let's see what Fedor's decision is. All right. So let's give him the next rating and then close that part out of here. So again, we see the same pattern over and over. Slightly too loose preflop. This is just because he wants to play hands and he comes from the tournament world but now to post-flop really having the thought processes and the action he decides to we see his tanking really tells us when he thinks about something to which decision he comes yeah was absolutely great in the big spots it's still variance that he ended up on the good side. It would be even better if we see Villain having Ace-King now. But it's, yeah, it seemed to me that he just like really knows what's going on. So now we have seen a couple of parts where he probably just like not misread the ranges, but just doesn't know how tight cash game ranges sometimes are and should be but then when the pot develops over multiple streets and things get really interesting over time he makes great decision or potentially we don't know the real results how people play ranges but it looked very very nice to me so let's let's keep giving i mean i feel like i need to downgrade him every single time a little more for that pre-flop looseness so give him a let's give him a freaking 5.8 for that and now after really messing up a couple of post-flop spots remember that 8-4 full punt we have seen before some other spots we have seen now two great bluff catching situations folding one calling one where I like both results of his decision making so let's give him a very very solid 9.1 again here for this one he's definitely not the type of guy you want to see go into the tank when you are when you are bluffing or value betting he will make a lot of correct decisions so yeah really really great to see it to see that and yeah gg fedor
