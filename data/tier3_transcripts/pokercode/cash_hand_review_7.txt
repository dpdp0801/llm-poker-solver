### TOPIC: cash hand review 7
 All right, let's keep going with reviewing Fedor's little cache experience here. Let's see some more footage available, hopefully some more big hands. We still have two tables of NL 5K in the bottom. Fedor played some huge pots, so we are sitting there with way more than 100 big blinds on both of those tables. And two 1K tables as an addition at the top. Let's keep an eye on the bottom left table. After contemplating a preflop raise, fade or wind for the limp, keep in mind that the bottom left table is an anti-table. So limping is way more interesting since the price is just way better and you want to build definitely want to build a limping range that is protected by strong hands as well so ace five suited i guess was either created as a limp call or a limp race raising is fine as well and yeah maybe for for beginners of limping strategies playing with ante just think a little of it that you mix it like mix all hands and everything and then your limp raising range which is the most complicated looks like a little little little like a big blind versus button three betting range just important to limp those hands in the first place this is why i'm just expecting fitter to limp raise ace five suited there quite often then facing-8-6 board it's actually not the best board in the world with its trade connectivity around the 6 and the 8. Villain has all those 7x, 9x, 5x type of hands while we have lots of broadway cards as well that just do not hit. So betting small would be fine. Checking is my preferred option here. And then after check check check, the jack is a great card for our range. Easy to find lots of bluffs that have still outs. Our broadway is 9-10, queen 10, this type of stuff. So definitely now the point to start betting large with our good value hands as well. Ace-5 is definitely one of those. It's just a weak top here, but we are in a limp pot after check check this is a very very strong hand by now the seven the nine ten gets there i mean obviously both players can have that but still like not a game-changing card and we definitely have a clear big value bet here again which i expect fedor to go for he goes for like three quarters pot something like that super fine villain can have any eight any jack any six well kicker doesn't play with our ace but that's about it so yeah I like the play and against that race villain pretty much I'm not sure the sizing is on the larger side not really sure whether he is he can wrap something i'm not sure experience in limp pots whether that still could be like a six seven eight seven type of hand where he's actually wrapping stronger like a nine five nine ten straight only maybe a7 i think this is yeah more of a larger race so definitely prefer to have a nine or 10 for those call offs ace 5 is a random catcher and yeah remember i think isidro was the guy we had in other parts with like crazy bluffs before so just calling a somewhat random catcher seems definitely fine we are in a limp pot with lots of lots of crazy combinations going on we've seen the 10-7 so yeah not overfolding there. It's a catcher. It's not a fist pump call. And yeah making the decision based on the player type there. Or just running a randomizer. Or something like that. Just a typical he has it or he doesn't. And this is why I went first with what is he actually repping. It's like is it any two pair? Is it just straights to then have an idea of the relation between like bluffs and value hands there, how they should like, how they could like, how easy it is to over bluff or not. All right, I stopped the action here for a second to look at that hand on the top left table. Fedor decided to open race. We just talked about ante being there on the bottom left table. Top left is without without ante so i'm a big fan of just having a raising range simplify things a little fedor did open race to 30 with his ace five offsuit faces an eight six five board a board that is clearly favorable for the big blind right our advantage having jacks queens kings aces is like has nothing to do with nuts we don't want to build the biggest pot of all times. It's like maybe getting two streets of value in. Not wanting to see a four, a seven, a nine, a five, a six, an eight, like all not great. So checking full range or almost full range is a very good idea here. And then obviously with this hand facing a bet, we need to call. Now the turn I think is very very interesting because villain just chooses the half pot sizing or like even slightly less than that which in my eyes is like not the typical thing you have your two thirds or 75% hot key. I think villain did bet something like 70% on the flop. No actually no that's not true actually he was betting half pot so it's not that like a change of the bat size always means something but here still on that 10 i don't think that he's wrapping a straight that he's wrapping a strong 10 it's more like that i have eight nine i want to squeeze out the last thin value which yeah i mean we have ace five which is a pair plus a draw to the top two pair in a way by beating something like eight six eight ten on the river at least three outs i think any five gives us more or less the nuts even though straights are possible so it's not possible to fold for that sizing but to keep it in mind expecting villain to have certain hands i would read him a lot on like an eight x type of hand here maybe the weakest of all tens to still have a river value bet then and just like seeing those sizing patterns learning from them so i think fedor has no option but calling and on that four i mean yeah now he has a random catcher if he faces a bet after that turn bet of villain which doesn't scream like bluffing to me another half pot bet there could mean anything i'm just trying to read a little and and let my experience speak in those spots if it went even for the snap fold not even thinking about it for half pot there so yeah Seems like some great tables there. That guy on the top left just called Jack's small bind versus button only. On the top right, we have someone limping from early position. Seems like a good game Fedor is in here. But yeah, let's focus on the bottom left table instead again. A 5k table with two very, very good players. We have seen that Isidro is capable of bluffing a lot there. Now we talked about a limping strategy before. Now Fedor decided to open raise something. You have to see the strategy as a whole thing. Limping allows you to play more hands. So if you play raise only, 10-7 is just too loose. But since you have some limps and some raises, you can overall put weaker hands in both of those ranges. And 10-7, well, can sometimes be a raise. And let's see how it continues on that board here. Small bet seems fine. Checking is another option. Big bet, I don't see it too much. And here on that turn, I think this is a card that helps Villain a little more. Villain should have a little more 9x. Villain has all the King-Jack, Queen-Jack that have easy continuations now facing different sizings. Villain has all better 10x. Villain has obviously 6x, 4x. So we have two options. Maybe a thin 75-66% percent bet we can size down now to really target only villains ace highs Like some kind of 4x and get our value that way or go for the check check to then have pretty easy River decisions if it goes check check. So let's see what Fedor decides He goes for the for the large, I mean it's not thin by now, thin in the ways of speaking. Hey, the river might be really ugly on lots of cards. you all right very interesting hand probably not on that turn anymore though but top right table Fedor went for a loose open race from the cutoff, which I guess is totally fine with a limping player that is sitting now in the small blind, probably not expecting too much action from him. So 9-7 suited is just like slightly off the correct ranges. So yeah, going for a bet on a board that you can almost bet full range on with a hand that still has some opportunities obviously we have nothing right now and then we face a check race which could still mean a lot of things what is villain wrapping pocket fours pocket eights king eight king four five six six seven five seven maybe some weak four x maybe some stronger king x and now when evaluating our hand it's really way more thinking about which strong hand can we make on the river, right? It's not about how do we perform right now. The hand is not over. It's more like, okay, we are working our way towards a bigger pot. There will be two more cards. So which hands can make something nice and can give me some like easy way to play on turns and rivers. So this hand is definitely not nothing, right? This is 3-2 straight with that 8. It has a backdoor flush draw. Any 6 is a great card. Any 10 is a great card. Any hearts is a great card. So this is something really to keep in mind when evaluating the hands you're having here. So facing that check raise, we have a clear call with our 9-7 suited as we would have with something like 9-10 suited. And yeah, then against that check, right, we have a pretty nice bet to just fold out any give up. I would like to see a smaller bet here. I think the bigger bet on that king doesn't make too much sense. We are just attacking something like a 5-6 give up, 6-7 give up 10 of something give up so just betting big right now putting extra money into villains king 10 type of check race doesn't make too much sense for me so yeah what i'm saying here is not like just my opinion it's it's more like what the solver teaches us or the way i learned it from there so it's really yeah it's i think it's a little i don't know there is a saying in german that i don't try to. So it's really, yeah, I think it's a little, I don't know. There is a saying in German that I don't try to translate, but it's really like taking two big of weapons, fighting like a very, very weak range that you can just really get away with a tiny bat to just fold out villains, villains give ups. Okay, so here I need to replay that hand from the bottom left. Let's have a look at that bottom left table now. is going for a limp here and starts betting 40% something like that on a jack 7-3 board. That seems fine and now I think we see a pretty pretty clear mistake. I mean the five is a nice card for villain just like he has more of that 7-5, 4-6 like everything that is connected he should have it more but i'm not sure whether fedor doesn't see his double gutter here but yeah fedor ends up check folding here which is not an option you can go for a fancy check race against a small bet you can even call even though it's just nine high it's just you have the correct price given some implied. It's a very, very mandatory bet. Multiple options are fine regarding the sizing. Anything that is not over pot should be fine. Small bet is fine. Bigger bet is fine as well. Check folding is a, is a clear, clear punt and I can only explain it if Fedor just didn't see that he has a double gutter actually. Or knows the run out maybe a little better. Right so again bottom left we see Fedor thinking about a four bet against that big blind three bet which hand category fits. I'm not sure what his frequencies are there. We have seen before in the spot, hats up, where he just went for the first hand, okay-ish to 4-bet and went with it. This is some frequency things. If he's doing that all the time, it's just too much. If he's doing this never, he's just like just playing value. So it's tough, tough to really comment on that when it's just a frequency thing. But just choosing the right categories is a good sign already. So here are three batting ace queen bottom left and then getting that board. That's a board where actually you prefer to have a bigger size. And yeah, so bigger means like not quarter pot, not like 30%, which it's fine as well. But the board is changing too much and giving too much of a positional advantage to in position. So actually, by using a very, very small bet, you just allow to villain or force villain to call pretty much any hand. And this cannot really be the goal that you create a situation without fold equity. If people are over folding, that's fine. right but here you definitely want to size up a little to at least make villains ace six of spades indifferent to calling. So position is a big thing here and this is why I think it's great to see Fedor size up to half pot here more or less and not stick to like his first hotkey button. And now on that turn it's a big question how you split your range. You're allowed to bet high frequency on that board, even with that slightly bigger sizing of half pot. And then on the turns, just about, well, you're definitely taking your Queens plus Ace Jack, King Jack plus to go directional in from here, right? Easily good enough to stack off here. And then you need the right additions right looking at two things blockers and equity right blockers against calling range and unblocking folding range or just equity to still make a nice river hand that you can then still stack up for value at the same time you don't want to give up showdown value with your bluffs so here ace queen i think is just too strong to be bluffing you have lots of other candidates 10-9 suited any king queen you're three batting any type of overcard you have ace four ace five suited eight nine four five suited something like that six outs are nice but here i think ace queen is checking down against all other ace queens they shouldn shouldn't be a bluff if I'm correct here. The villain should and could have ace 10 suited. That is potentially not a bluff and by betting here we are folding out all the ace tens, ace nines that actually we do great against. So it's really that cooler versus cooler if the river then is an ace, well we just lost all those cool so yeah i think like something like ace four ace five here are mandatory big bets ace queen i think is just clear over bluffing and not the perfect hand choice but let's see it seems like he he goes for the bet but we haven't seen it all right so maybe more things to think about is, well, ace-king would be kind of the same thing, just my argument's a little stronger. So I'm not 100% sure. I'm sure about the ace-kings being mainly just a check and the ace-queens, maybe some of them are allowed to bet as like an addition to have a little nice six-outer. But then next thing is we have all ace-queen offs off suits next thing would be to think about blockers as well right what do the two cards you are having tell you so what is interesting here is the suits right so villain is not defending queen jack off suit so it's for example better to have the queen of diamonds the queen of hearts or the queen of spades instead of having the queen of clubs. So you just block queen jack. Another thing is the backdoors villain is calling. Villain is calling ace four of clubs, ace five of clubs, ace eight of clubs, probably not of spades. So by unblocking those you have more turnfold equity. So actually I would love to see here the ace of spades a little more. Even though you're ahead of that. So this is just like meaning, okay, villain did call the flop. Now he will be folding with this type of hand. And this is just whenever it's about offsuit combos, a little guideline how to really make choices there. Instead of just saying saying yeah i bet ace queen here right ace queen is not necessarily the same combo all the time and this time we get the snap fold maybe we're ahead maybe villain at pocket fives who knows that's definitely the best best outcome there for us now interested to see bottom left how Fedor is approaching that spot because here anti-table. We definitely want to have a flatting range there just because we can play more hands given the better price we are having and then pocket threes is more or less a mandatory call just fitting into that range. Now stabbing seems light but seems reasonable as well so it's okay like that king high board with that more that it seems fine. Yeah maybe just to say that again if you like the way I'm describing stuff here this is how we work at Poker Code as well. We are a full community of players that help each other, that help each other evolve as poker players as well as as in life in general so just this is the hand discussions that's that go on all the time this is type of videos we're making all kind of that content helping each other evaluating each other just like sharing concepts sharing reads right here you even see that lots of things i a hundred percent sure about but then it's like hey why not ask another guy who plays pretty much the same stuff like are people bluff heavy there, are they are they call happy, how do you approach those spots, this is how Fedor and me personally got to the point where we are and this is what we do at poker code helping you get to that point maybe as well or whatever your personal goals are in poker just getting a little closer here now back to the action small blind versus cut of three bad with king ten suited looks like a great hand calling is an option i mean the standard option for betting is an option as well hit our goes for the call and we have a very interesting flop. I guess we have if facing bats no decision to make for two streets but now this is really interesting. So now this is something I haven't seen before. We are playing 200 big blinds deep. I'm not a 200 big blind specialist. I'm just sometimes playing that deep and then mainly not against some of the best players in the world. So what we are seeing here is a 10% bet. And what is that targeting? Mainly it's just saying, hey, Kevin's saying fold your freaking 8-9 of diamonds. We are not allowed to fold any pockets, I would say. There are two outs to still make a set is great. We are not allowed to fold anything with any kinds of backdoors so it's really yeah it's more the challenge to build the correct raising range right i would in game i would treat that more or less like a check because i'm forced to continue with everything i can maybe fold like five to ten percent that's about it so i treat it like a check that's the same thing against a check i'm forced to play a hundred percent of my range and what would I be raising here? Am I raising something like king-10 would I bet that against a check close, right? So I see both things I can see a race I can see a call that's like the same thing like Kevin checks to me and goes check check Where he checks to me and I bet whatever sizing I want to bet probably betting on the little larger side here Something like half pot and go from there. so let's see which choice Fedor makes okay going for a sizing and then clicking on the call button so I treat that spot again as kind of a check check and now delayed game it's really I'm so curious to see kevin's hand here and now after check check i just think that just like for your mind makes it a little easier what would you do after check check on the flop where here the bet yes there was a bet there was a call but basically the same thing happened because the bet was so tiny i think on that flush board now king 10 is like one clear street of value, right? If you bet now, you don't get away with a river bet. Maybe on the deuce of hearts. Villain should be protected with all the flushes he's having. He can play jacks and kings like that as well. All kinds, yeah, all kinds of spades he can play that way. So I think I'm more in the checking camp because I don't need to deny equity. Denying for me really means this equity folds. Spades are not folding. So it's more like I could charge spades to then check back. That works out. Why I can strengthen my range. Check back, have an easy call against anything. A raise against a block bet or just a large bet against a check. It's kind of indifferent, right? Just the evaluation of my hand strength. I think this is clear one street street and in which line I put it exactly I'm not 100% sure what my preference there is and we see the same thing Fiedler thinks about it types in the sizing thinks about the check so yeah I like to see that a lot he decides that he likes to charge spades maybe fold out even something like ace 10 ace queen over a card plus gutshot it's kind of a success as well the call and on that eight i think this is just too thin to go for value because villain is still protected should play quite some should play jacks like that sometimes should play lots of flushes like that if he uses that 10% line as a standard thing. And now we are betting a king with no kicker. Yeah I think it's just too thin. We are running in too many better hands. Sure we get sometimes called by queens, by ace-jack, by some tens with a spade. That's all fine. But the risk of getting jammed on just like kills kills that thin value for us so yeah but to our big lens deep i'm not 100 sure myself would be interesting to run it and now i really hope to see Federer's decision. Now we are out of position and that argument is even stronger because we are 200 big blinds deep out of position this is even for 100 big blinds almost a zero percent call sometimes a fold and sometimes a four bet so now it's even more about board coverage when we play deeper to make sure to have nuts on certain board types and yeah that makes it i mean sometimes calling cannot be too bad but makes it not that interesting to draw to a top here that is kind of second best right when we flop a queen it's not the greatest thing in the world when you flop an ace we still well are beaten by any ace king so it's not the perfect spot and like hitting a straight or something is kind of face up compared to other hands that could make straights so forebetting can be a thing but it's not it's not the spot where we are happy to stack off like top pairs like we are 100 big blinds deep so it's very very interesting if it goes for the c-bet as we've seen all the time always going for the slightly loser decision going for the slightly more aggressive decision and yeah let's see how he plays that board. Let's think about how ranges look like. Villain should have quite some 5-6-6-7 suited. Villain has all kinds of peers. The question is whether Villain has a 5 betting range that deep. Is kings a good value 5 bet? Is Fedor always 4 betting queens and jacks or is it more like aces and ace acts? So actually villain has quite a lot of good hands as well as villain has king queen of hearts, king jack of diamonds maybe. So here I would like to see either a check because it's just not really our board or see him starting off with kind of a small bet to attack that weaker stuff. Having that ace of spades tell us a little the direction of where the pot could go, right? Some potentials, some blockers, some potentials for the turn. A big bet doesn't make too much sense. It's too easy for villain to react, but half pot still is okay. It's more now just like hammering on villain with jacks jacks and no spade pretty much. And now the question is right, what would Fedor do with aces for example? Where does he start to only wrap a flush or something? Yeah, really, really, really interesting spot. I think aces are good enough to go all the way and just like some six, seven six should raise the flop aces with a spade should be fine just like how many kings queens jacks they are facing so i'm thinking about that because my bluffing hands always want to do the same thing like my value hands here the ace of spades obviously just a gin card to have and yeah okay let me scroll back to see the hand on the bottom left. All right, so 7-8 of diamonds on the bottom left. Flopping a flush seems good. And I might repeat myself here, but yeah, flush pots pretty much play as if there was no flush, just sizes get decreased because both players have all kinds of nuts. And then at some point you're in the flush. So something that we are usually not seeing here is just splitting your range now using a 120 30 percent pot sizing is just not a thing makes it very very easy for kevin to react because he shouldn't check raise too often on that on that three diamonds board he has all king high flushes all queen high flushes all jack high flushes all ten high flushes all nine high flushes, all queen high flushes, all jack high flushes, all ten high flushes, all nine high flushes. So seeing that it's quite an easy fold with just like ace seven no diamonds. And this is something you can do that as an exploit against people who are just not folding. But yeah, it's more like him playing his hand face up. Maximum charging king x of diamonds and Yeah. And charging like ace-axe. Like those hands that call anyways before there is another diamond. So I... maximum charging king x of diamonds and uh yeah and charging like ace x like those hands that call anyways before there is another diamond so i really don't like to see that split because i'm just saying in no way that is ever balanced no way that is balanced so now what i like to see here is since this line it could be by phil or it could be something like ace king ace queen just getting that maximum out as well to then check back. Fedor's hand kind of is the same, because it has the clear plan of checking back diamond rivers. So I love seeing that race here. I think you won't find that too much in a solver, but just like how I think, or how my experience is, how that pot is played, which lines are, it's like lots of, it's just triggered by certain hand types that Kevin wants to fast play his strong flushes as well as adding some bluffs here, right? To just like give ace queen offsuit a challenge. That's probably ace queen of spades, probably snap fold here. So just take over initiative, just saying, hey, that big bet doesn't make sense. Whatever you try to represent here, my race doesn't make sense either, but I put you i put you on a certain type of hand strength and yeah now fedor all of a sudden from fist pump value is in a bluff catch situation villain is not check raising worse for value maybe pocket eights but we are blocking that yeah i mean i don't see fedor folding a flush ever to be honest and i'm interested whether we see the freaking diamond bluff or not I don't think we even need I would love prefer to see Kevin's bluff containing like a 10 of diamonds or nine of diamonds because I don't see Fedor ever overbetting like the king x of diamonds and now okay it was just a bluff give up yeah I'm not sure maybe not let's see just my assumptions all right but I still like the line. And I really, I mean, this here is something we could look up in the solver. Everyone can do that for himself. Flushboards, turnover betting, not really happening. So we are on a very exploitative level here. Just like trying to make certain things happening for our hands. and this is now where we have seen Fedor against one of the best cash game players just fighting it out right well Fedor had the advantage of just having a flush obviously winning that hand but if I would need to bet I think Kevin had the better end of the strategy here so I kind of need to rank down that that play to like, yeah, like a three or four out of 10. Yeah, it's like I'm not really now we see Fedor typing defend against a cutoff open race by Isidro or is it maybe even the button and someone was on sit-up? No, it's a cutoff. So now we see Fedor typing in an overbet sizing here. So what happened? Flop check check on a board that, yeah, I mean, it's not a range bet board. So a check check is totally a thing here. Isidro definitely has a full range, not just a couple of hands. And now, yeah, what is happening? Yeah, Isidro shouldn't have too many jack nines never six four not really six nine so he is like pocket eights is maybe his strongest hand but that all those hands figure is offsuit like I mean jack nine he has offsuit nine six he has all of them suited in his range six four as well so definitely reason to just go a little crazy here and a6 obviously is a candidate to go crazy as well it looks like an open enter if we think about open enter about overbetting the nine is not a nice out so it's more like a gut shot to the four and you prefer to have like nine x for your overbetting here clearly so fedor thinks about it nails that sizing that exists smaller sizes are fine as well and then decides to not go crazy against the slightly crazy guy who is bluffing a lot so yeah interesting then the next spot yeah we see him here thinking about the race not going for it next spot is the queen and now the question is what are Fedor's weakest hands right is he if he's checking this year is he ever bluffing yeah probably a king deuce of diamonds. But just to keep in mind, right, is that I'm not sure maybe this is just a standard check. Maybe it's like sometimes okay to bluff. Sure, Isidro hits some queen acts, but what does he do with like pocket sixes? What does he do with like ace-jack type of hands? So it's interesting how we see, okay, against the so far crazy guy Fedor not doing anything pretty much pretty much a straight value so far and we see the 5-4 hand that makes a lot of sense obviously all right let's wrap it up here very interesting footage again lots of interesting hands going on not the biggest ones so far but we see the pattern just like the same pattern over and over again that's soor slightly too loose pre-flop slightly too aggressive I would say with three betting four betting so far he didn't get hurt for that right we didn't face a five bet jam not like light four bets against his two light three bets or something like that and it's all working out for him the four bat pot he got away with that ace queen offsuit on that ace of spades where i have to say i'm not sure 200 big blind steep what the strategy there is actually right he went for the ace queen offsuit he got a good board he won the hand all fine right so the ace queen i think the turn bad there especially ace queen three bad pot turn bad i was like it's like really overdoing it i'm pretty sure of that and yeah so it's it's and that one against against kevin with that seven eight i just have to give him a down rate for that so i stick to this six out of ten rating for pre-flop i gave him great ratings for post-flop so far in most of the parts this one i have to downgrade for that 7.8 of diamonds only give him like a 7.2 and yeah can't can't wait to to see the rest of the footage and give the last maybe see some more crazy hands and yeah thanks again as always for tuning in I hope you enjoy those highlights and if you want to see more discussions and participate in in like talks about hands like that check out poker code this is what we are doing there with the community as well as live coachings like that where you can participate in the chat and just talk to me and fedor and matthias and everyone we enjoy that a lot this is how we get better and i would love to see you in the team as well
