### TOPIC: cash hand review 8
 All right, let's go for the last part of the little series of me talking you through Fedor's cash game hands here. Still two tables in a 5k, super deep, already made quite some money there on those tables. Two additional 1k tables up top and let's see whether we see some more interesting hands going on. starting off with a very very light three-bet there with King 6 suited against villain's hands and yeah so really every pip that you're king high is higher meaning king seven king eight makes it slightly better since this is a spot where villain is pretty much flatting a hundred percent of sixes sevens eights and that really means a lot regarding regarding equity there just like beating those hands and like some small pots or not and this is why i think this i mean we can flat that sometimes but it's more like I think it's a very very light this time Fedor getting punished with the cold four bad and let's actually this on the top left seems quite interesting I didn't follow the action there so far where as well this year very very interesting top left table if he decides to go for a somewhat random three bat from the big blind i see right away that this is a tournament thing all right this is when you polarize in the tournament world with shorter stacks then your equity that you have against calling range matters less and you can take those ace deuce, ace three, king four, king five off suits when it's really just about aces kings especially in ICM situations like 35, 40 big blinds deep this is how three bad ranges look like. In cash game this is not possible or not not not very good just because we are too deep. The villains are flatting and you still have to play a lot so this year you will play against strong hands and something like a suited hand gives you five percent to make a flush five percent extra equity this is something you should go for you can take your king six suited sometimes there you can take your king four your ace seven suited something like that you cannot be as shitty as like ace 5 off suit. That's just not okay This is just way too loose not only to lose with the correct hand selection But clearly going for the wrong hand selection against any player if you have to read that this guy is folding 80% versus three bats totally fine, but you cannot have that Not good at all here. I try to make it as clear as possible just because this is a major mistake. This is just not, yeah Fedor is doing Fedor things. No, this is something he transferred over from the tournament world. Now, let's see next step. He gets a board, 8-6-4 with a flush draw. That spot Willem shouldn't call all pocket 8s pocket 6s pocket 4s so actually this is not a brick board but it's like our jacks plus queens plus are still nutted and this is now one of the best okayish bluffs we want to use a bigger bet to not allow villain to just call everything and then see the run out right any 7 any 9 any hearts, any six, any four, just makes it easier for villain to continue there just given his position. So we either want to bet big and this sizing here saying big, I mean something like this in a three-bet pot, is totally fine. Ace of diamonds is a nice card to have, obviously hearts would be even better. Yeah, so the sizing is fine, now he has to play a hand that just doesn't make any sense in that range and go from there. Turning an ace, villain could have all kinds of flushes. We have more or less mandatory check on that flush card. Villain has that way more than we have it. Maybe we can get away with a small bet with some hands. But here we have kings, we have queens, etc. So checking seems to be the most reasonable thing, especially that hand we have pretty much no option and then we're caught in the reaction game facing a third pot bet check calling it's probably our only option river is a full brick and now we have a pure bluff catcher with yes we block four five of clubs and we block the ace that's about it if a long jams he's pretty much wrapping ace king plus and we see already feet are going for the first is five let's think what's interesting here is always it's just about the ratio of bluffs and value hands so we find the value hands villain it's easy to find them for him as well he turns a flush flush, he goes for value. He has ace king with a king of hearts, he plays it that way. He has pocket eights and pocket sixes, he plays it that way. Now it's important to find the bluffs. What are the potential bluffs? Something like nine, ten of diamonds. Is that a preflop call? Flop call, sure. Turn, start bluffing, maybe, maybe not. Jack ten of diamonds, something like that. pocket sevens, pocket fives, do they start betting the turn always, do they call preflop always, do they go for it always, close, I think this is really one of the spots where it's tough to find enough bluffs, you need to float something like pocket deuces and then start going crazy on the turn, pocket threes, to just like have those bluffs on those runouts if you don't have that you will always end up value heavy in those spots and i would like to see fedor folding here especially the five of clubs is a card i actually dislike because pocket fives is something that people could play like that sometimes i expect him to fold that actually like just after him having that first thought yeah but just mainly he started to play like not good preflop and this is what he got to then. Pretty calm right now, bottom left, the range bet, cutoff versus big blind, that hand. And facing a small check raise here I think makes our ace of diamonds just a continuation yeah it's a board where actually we are the big favorite villain obviously should still find some check raises but just means that like together with all our strong hands we need some some floats as well and then obviously the the ace of diamonds tells us something to have something going now just checking down with a showdown, nice hand. By both actually, like check raising 10-3 of diamonds there sometimes to then just give up. It's totally reasonable. Again we see the next spot with ace-queen offsuit on the top right. Again it's not the perfect spot to put in calls. I expect Fedor to call too often here because in anti tournaments you do that. In those cash game ranges it's just no. It's just not the great hand you want to play there 100 big blinds deep. It's like low frequency you can mix it in but the way he snapped it off as if it was the most standard play of all times, just like, yeah, show something. And now, obviously, he has so many screen offsuit combos that he needs to mix it, like sometimes having it in the calling range, sometimes having it in the check raising range, as well as check raising some of the gut shots, draws, 9x, and go from there. So bottom left again a board that you can easily range bet king five making it nothing happening. okay so this year is very, very interesting. Let's have a look at the top right table. Dylan is c-betting on a board on like 10-8-4 with two diamonds. First of all, he could have multiple c-bet sizes here. It's a board where betting big is definitely fine as well. And now we have a flush draw. So the question is always, or a question I get very often is, which flush draws should I raise and in the end it's just a mix they are just some preferences so one preference we can talk about here is definitely having the coolers on your side so you don't want to block weaker flush draws so i prefer having the queen high flush draw that has the queen deuce for example queen three for that reason king deuce king three ace deuce ace three just allowing villain right if we check raise queen seven here villain cannot have seven six this is thing number one just in general it's not necessarily counting for that exact hand because of reason number two the next upside is having additional backdoor equity we're here with a seven we have a backdoor straight for that reason i would prefer something like well obviously jack nine and jack seven having like even the the monster draw something like five six five seven but something like the ace six ace seven ace five is maybe more interesting for that reason because of ace deuce and this really depends on the on the board sometimes those reasons add up sometimes they are working against each other but that gives you an idea to really think about okay which hands do i want to check call which flush draws which ones do i want to check race here's like yes every deuce three king deuce king three is like a good reason because well we might be flushing over flushing if it gets there so So yeah, and then every 5, 6, 7, 9 jacks somehow connects with like straight equity. So here it's a big mix of everything, probably queen 7, totally fine to check raise, totally fine to check call. But I think a really, really great spot to just think about that and maybe look at some stuff to really see, okay, what are the preferred hands for certain reasons. but now let's jump back as well or look at both tables at the same time bottom right pocket queens clear cold for bad 100 going with that would be interesting if the middle position the hijack starts doing something just being 200 big blinds deep with him and yeah top right at the same time queen seven of diamonds now on that queen jack nine gets there which we have or both have obviously we don't have the best queen so checking is like the standard thing i think on the river river now we have either a block bet or check so i like seeing that block bet and here against a calling range in that four bad pot how does that look like it's like jacks tens aces has a trap sometimes ace kings kings should be mainly jamming you can sometimes call ace king you have ace queen suited maybe and then like some six seven suited four five suited something like that against linear range cold four betting range you're not calling too much like jack ten suited just to dominate it by that so try to think in those spots to to think about the part i'm really interested in right how we get it in against aces i don't care i'm not like checking to try and and dodge aces at some point that that would be wrong so it's really that villain can have ace queen of clubs or diamonds he has a give up or he has something like jacks or tents where the only thing that can happen is actually action killers. So on that board, I prefer to have a bigger size to have the option to jam it on the turn. I don't like quarter pot here out of position with that specific combo. I could do that with some aces, where I have an upside. Maybe then I bet small with aces, villain calls king queen of clubs, turn is the queen of clubs. That's pretty nice, right? Or king of clubs king of clubs so something like that we can play multiple sizes here but really think about the incentives and the best thing is really think about the key part of villain's range there are some hands with that stack death it's just going in we have two times pot left we are playing here right it's like okay maybe against a big sizing six five just needs to jam it that's good for me as well before there's bad stuff happening right river might be a king of diamonds we're super lost all right so i would go with like some half pot here let's see what fedor decides goes for like smaller and then scrolls up not not total half pot but somewhere in that direction on the top hand there it just goes for the block but fold. Now the pocket Queens I think it's you can just jam it you can start like a non jamming range here but I think the jam is just just yeah it's just a jam no other options really while that ace-8 offsuit squeeze is again just like that. Yes, if he does it very, very low frequency, you can argue for that against the button. But it's more like especially 200 big blinds, those hands really decrease in value. And you want to have something that has a chance to sometimes have a value hand for 200 big blinds. So suited, somewhat connected, just way, way, way, way, way, way, way better. This is perfect for 45 big blinds but I don't like to see that here in the cash game world Fedor is going for the check which might be just because that guy is very very aggressive but Queens like you want to protect your range there with aces or something like that I think those Queens are just a jam it's not like you want to check for the 10. Obviously, villain can have 10s, but yeah, I don't see that check, to be honest. Just like so much bad stuff happening when it goes check, check. That's like, I mean, it's not the best card in the deck, but obviously an okay one. And maybe he just missed value from the 9s that would call off a jam on the turn. Maybe he missed value from the jacks. I'm not even sure whether the queens are a clear jam on that river. It's, yeah, I just, I don't understand the turn play at all. Depends a lot on how exact ranges look like here right at three bad he's probably three bad only and then continuing versus the four bad how much is he trapping how wide is he calling given a certain sizing given fedor's image just think like if we put that in the solver we have the clearest turn jam of all times and yeah obviously on that river it's just range wise a bad card because isidro should have almost all queens in his flatting range. And we should, I mean, which queens do we river? Like an ace queen of clubs that gave up before. A trap aces, villain improves to more flushes. It's like, I'm not sure myself, but I'm not really convinced of Fedor's play. Let's get back to that ace-eight offsuit. Bottom left, Fedor did squeeze pre-flop and went for a small c-bet on that flop. I already said I really do not like that squeeze here. That deep, out of position, you need more equity or better playability than this hand. You can hope to make it two-pair. Yes, you can do that with every hand, but besides that, your ace blocker is not that relevant 200 big blind steep that's something if villains answer is mainly the four bad like in tournament world four bad jamming 40 big blinds then your ace blocker is pretty great having an eight is a nice card to have playing against villains sevens and sixes that might fled and then you can stack off on eight high boards this is all different 200 big blinds deep out of position now we have a problem c betting they are flopping at top here hating life on the turn so check check is the best we can hope for and now is the question do you fold right away or do you and like you put yourself into that position by just starting off with wrong hand selection pre-flop and now he's having like on the turn this is like an indifferent call already like folding ace-8 there is totally fine. Will in his king-jack ace-8 like it's what are the bluffs right and this is just being too loose here or having the wrong hand selection preflop this is the perfect example how it brought Fedor in trouble right if he only has like suited ace-8s here it's kind of an easy decision i mean this here is just a mandatory fold but he is just overfolding if he has like all of those ace-8 off suits and it's just like kind of easy to outplay someone who plays like kind of random hands All right, it seems like we are in the last hands. Sit out next big blind clicked on by Fedor. All right, it seems like we are in the last hand. Sit out next big blind, clicked on by Fedor. Pocket queens again, nines in the squeeze pod, nothing to do there. you okay jack five has a lost hand on that table i think that's it time to wrap it up nothing more happening so again going for the last rounds of ratings maybe i think this part ah sorry fedor but this pre-flop yeah you got punished you got punished sir three batting too light squeezing too light three batting wrong hands squeezing wrong hands i remember the well just like slightly too light okay hand selection king six suited button versus cut off but then the ace five offsuit big blind versus hijack and the ace eight offsuit squeeze. If you tell me you rolled like a very very very specific number with your randomizer both times okay but I don't think so. So I think that was just too much of it and this time you got really punished by well ending up with very shitty hands in the end and that was not unlucky to end up with like a top pair no kicker this was how your whole strategy was designed to end up with right so i think you played it all fine post flop in a way actually so i can't rate you down for that but this was the perfect example where if you really if the basics are not correct i think i can i mean i'm not too experienced right now in tournaments but i think i understand where those offsuit aces squeezes and three bets come from from just a very very different stack depth and this is now where we have seen like that even like getting some basics wrong can just like lead to major major problems right the ace five offsuit and the ace eight off suits were both two pots three bad pots where two big bets went in the middle to then check fold the river right just like butchering your your red line totally and that was actually the only clear mistake was the pre-flop like very very small thing so yeah let's really hammer on you this time let's give you a 3.2 for pre-flop only and post-flop was still fine it's just like yeah you couldn't do anything with those hands so i'll still give you the 8.7 there that's all fine but really next next game, we need to make sure to get those ranges a little more right there. And then you end up in more favorable spots for you where you can make your great post-flop decisions. Yeah, again, I hope everyone enjoyed that. Seeing how even some of the best make big mistakes when they jump into like games they are not totally familiar with. That's your chance to be better than anyone else focusing on something this helps you accept your own mistakes or same for me right just like seeing that seeing mistakes people are doing just helps me so much to not be mad about myself when i sometimes make mistakes that i definitely do every single session and yeah it's all about the process learning is our goal here with poker code with the community together having our life coachings having those videos out here for free for you guys enjoying it see how we work and take the best out of it and yeah good luck at the tables everyone and maybe next time you spot fedor at the table just jump in defend correctly take his money and enjoy the show
