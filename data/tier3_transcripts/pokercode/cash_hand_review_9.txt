### TOPIC: cash hand review 9
 All right, welcome to today's video and for the first time I guess now I will actually review not my play but the play from one of the members. So I'm not 100% sure which stakes we are playing right now but maybe we figure out over time and see a pot size at some point. We see 100 pp, it shouldn't matter too much anyways and we see two tables of zoom. You can see the replayer as well if you missed out on something and what i'll try to be doing now is just watch the play he recorded and obviously stop whenever i disagree with a move or i have certain timestamps that i will stop at for sure i didn't read anything he has given me so far so i see the timest timestamp here on my left. And actually, I will stop at those points. And then we'll discuss. I will read out loud what he wrote down. And we'll discuss what my opinion on that is. Pretty much as if that was like a live coaching right now. So I asked him to keep him muted while playing. To not have a back and forth with different voices so we have it in written here what his thoughts were for interesting points so every one of you can can think themselves first and then we'll discuss a little something so i'm super excited to see what's going on here and yeah let's give it a go good old 10-8 off fold and 5-3 off fold to start with. I won't comment all the play. I mean, it's two tables We will fold a lot of hands that are not interesting I will stop if there is something that I definitely disagree with and then looking at the first Timestamp at about one minute and then yeah read what's going on there. I Hope to see a queen-jack suited open raise here. 6-3 offsuit definitely not a defend So using 2.3x3 X on the cutoff I like that let's figure out whether we use multiple open race sizes pocket Jack's okay to playable hands and I guess here we are at the first timestamp so this seems seems to be a decision already. I definitely see the point. Let's see what MrPower2311 told me here. He writes tight player and says like brown means the movie extra, like player that doesn't do anything but is just there. Opens middle position. He had a very low number on the RNG and low for him means aggressive, but he considered if he just wants to call here. So I don't care about his RNG so far from the strategy aspect because I cannot evaluate that, but having the thought process, okay, this is probably a mixed three bet. Is it maybe too weak to three bet or not? Yeah, I mean, in any chart that makes sense to me this is a mix. Sometimes a call, often a 3-bet and now taking into account what is Villain doing wrong. Villain is too tight, not doing anything, probably over folding, maybe opening too tight, we don't know exactly. Could be a reason to tighten up even more and have a bigger edge with a higher SPR playing a single raised pot. So yeah I can see reasons to tend a little more towards calling here. I don't know how strong your read with that tag is necessarily so I would maybe deviate a little towards calling but for now I'm happy with a with a mix. It didn't write anything for the top right board. Small c-bet is way to go. We could implement a bigger size as well and queen six would fit in there, but simplifying small only there with full range is definitely totally fine. So nothing really to comment on here. And yeah, waiting for the next timestamp, which is on minute number two. yeah 30 seconds from now let's see ac3 suited definitely open raising so i already see multiple open race sizes i like that going a little bigger from the button should make more sense we want to use smaller sizes from earlier positions to have a better risk risk reward against people who play three bet only. So every cent we invest into an open raise size doesn't make sense when we do not get called anyways. So now here we are at his next decision point that he marked, which seems to be the turn. So let's see what he wrote again. Against a bigger bet on the turn, I would only call to protect my check back range. But against the rounded 60% bet, I decided to fast play. So interesting to me that if he marks that hand already to not talk about the flop. So the flop is really, really good for us. It looks a little as if there is some connectivity for the big blind as well. But actually a 5 and a deuce is a very different thing than a 6, 3, 7, six three seven four eight five right so it's just villain doesn't have many hands there that that connect with a deuce so i think we can get away with a very very high c-bet frequency there is no mistake in checking back ace three i think i prefer the c-bet strategy with a higher frequency or even full frequency on weaker limits where people are not check raising and potentially just over folding some hands like queen jack queen 10 even with a diamond in their hand so yeah i like the c-bet and now coming to the turn this in your statement there's one big misconception about this spot if villain bets big here we still need to freaking race right protection is only a thing when we have well when we are guaranteed to still have a good hand on the river but here lots of rivers are killing us so the three kind of kills our action but obviously hearts and diamonds double flush draw we don't have heart we don't have diamonds makes it more likely that villain has those hands and we definitely don't want to trap with something that is that strong but not like the nuts on every single river. So to trap here we have to consider what can be river nuts. So river nuts can be hearts, can be diamonds and something on a brick, but on every brick we will improve to a little something as well. The river at set, for example. Or the river two pair with our five X. Or the river two pair with the weak king. So all that can be nuts, right? So yes, if we have the ace of diamonds, three of hearts, maybe we can protect that sometimes. But here mainly we have a value hand. There's lots of equity going on against us. First instinct is always race. If we are playing low stakes, even more important, you need to decide the size of the pot yourself. Villain is not necessarily helping. He is definitely not over bad jamming the river, knowing that you are capped on a seven river or whatever. So this is just not happening so that would be an yeah over assumption and just the wrong hand to do that play with so i want to see a race here and let's see let's see how you continue actually against that sizing that's like neither neither nor it's like not really representing much i definitely race bigger than that 8.6 really giving him some trouble 9.4 yeah i can see going like 13.5 anything is fine here just like not giving the correct price to all his random draws he might be having all right so right next spot on the left is exactly here and queen do suited close open race but happy to see that we can go even a little looser on tighter tables on weaker tables so that's that's pretty good and you write down i decided to range bet the flop against the rack turn this easy check back the river thought my hand is pretty low in my range so decided to turn my hand into a bluff so very very interesting to fold out king x and ace x actually some text was missing here i need to scroll down a bit more right range bet flop definitely makes sense if we want to split this obviously a hand that fits into a check back range as well range bet we can get away with quarter pot 30 or even lots of half pot betting i think our hand is interested in betting small most of the time so yeah i like to see it you know your full strategy going with the range bet and now the 10 is obviously a very bad card for us hand wise not range wise yeah so you're saying your hand is low in your range actually it's not right you have four five five six seven eight six seven all the low pocket peers some of them you're barreling on the turn i understand that but this is incredible over bluffing just incredible over bluffing so this would be such a huge assumption your assumption pretty much needs to be that villain bets every jack villain is not trapping boats really. The villain is not check raising bluffs and villain is check folding a king always so it's like we need strong strong strong strong strong assumptions to make that a plus cv bet here yes we are not beating much but taking this hand here to bluff is just really overdoing it you're actually bluffing against the same hand i'm happy to check down here and split against all Q9 Q8s in this world and yeah this is actually a strong adjustment and strong deviation from the solver and therefore I want to have stronger reads than none I guess. So yeah maybe wrong image of your own range there with just how many pockets we are having is just insane. Let's see now I want to see whether it worked out or maybe we even get called by a king. Getting check raised. All right. Let's see how the pocket sixes go. We will take some more time until we reach the next timestamp. Definitely not a cold 4-bet, so a good fold. Ace-8 suited, small blind versus MP open. Not really making the cut. We could start thinking about ace-9 suited against 2.2, ace-10 against 2.5 so ace-8 is just close. Jack-9 suited here, standard open. Even going smaller so now I've seen 2.3 from the cutoff, 2.5 from the button, 2.1 from under the gun. I like seeing that those little deviations right it's not a big difference but just shows that you're trying to apply something that makes sense and now we have the next time stamp i guess and you write down it's about the right table our east queen offsuit i want to fold flop already but couldn't make myself to do it with two overs all right everybody please take a second here and think about what would you do and what do you think would theory do two different things right so i give you that second actually like that spot so yeah we are racing under the gun what is our range aces kings queens jacks tens nines eight sevens and then let's see how many of the pockets below that we We have ace-king, ace-queen, ace-jack, ace-ten, ace-nine, suited aces some more king queen king jack queen like it's i mean what my point is we are smashing that work pretty much if he checks to us even though he is a small blind flatter right this i don't know how much strength to read into his small blind flatting range but that half pot donk tells me that probably he's not the strongest player so i'm close to range betting here and this is what i want to follow up with his small donk doesn't hurt me at all random half pot bet yes it usually does mean that he has like something going on on that board but still any run out is great for me my hand can turn the top here which is pretty great can make backdoor straight draws i should have fold equity right now i will have fold equity over time my first instinct here is to raise to just say like your donk doesn't make sense sir i would range bet now and even though you donk i go with my bet which would be a race then the other option is a call we keep king queen queen 10 in that we dominate something like ace 10 we keep the pot small against random jack x9 x he could have we have our equity let's go from there so folding definitely out of question and yeah calling and raising seems both reasonable to me let's see what's next so turn back now pretty much same thing and now at some point we need to start put villain on a range in a way he can have a jack he can have a nine would be super random but he could have like a queen 10 king 10 king queen all of that as well we still have two over cards villain shouldn't have a three really he's not representing strength with a half pot bet we have the equity against jack almost we have clubs going for us not that we have like a flush draw but at least we have the ace of clubs that gives us some room for navigation we know that villain won't have many flushes on a club river so for me again fold is absolutely out of question on the turn we dominate his bluffing part i don't know if whether there is any but maybe it's only bluffs i don't know so i take the river go from there and still being super happy about a queen or an ace as long as villain doesn't size up to a pot bet then and and represents i don't know a straight on the river queen something like that so i definitely am not folding and i think this is just too weak of a play to just yeah throw it throw it away here raising would be fine as well king queen nice squeeze So, king high board squeezed pod, we can easily get away with the range bet here. Small sizing and go from there against a def, like I think the note says def, definitely fish. So against him we want to especially control the size of the pot ourselves. And now I think the turn can be interesting. Let's see, you wrote something down for that action with the king 10 what happened so far villain open raises the cutoff we defend so far so standard villain checks back a freaking king jack four board which is definitely not standard high frequency line here is the small c-bet some big c-bet can be a thing as well the check back usually is as I call it triggered by hand which makes it very likely that villain has a king five of spades jack ten pocket tens those hands that have the feeling okay i actually if i invest more money i only get it in against better hands if i check back i'm like i keep everything in i beat like that typical thought whereas it's way more about all kinds of equities we are continuing nine 9-10, queen 10, ace 10, 4-axe, all kinds of stuff while he has a huge range advantage. What I like doing here is just playing very very thinly and aggressively for value on those turns to really I just put villain on a jack and or pocket tens or a weak king and try to get the maximum out of that. If the turn is an offsuit six i can easily overbet my king 10 if i want and here on that six of hearts not that villain has lots of flushes going for him but it's easier for him to navigate a little having jack x with a heart having jack x without a heart lots of rivers change the board and yeah still i think as an exploit if that read that i'm talking about is strong we can overbet now and then use like a normal or block bet on the river to just get the maximum out of a random jack and as a standard play i like your 75 and that should be totally fine and i absolutely forgot to read out loud what you thought so now i gave you my my thoughts unfiltered let's just see i thought villain's lock check back is pretty capped mostly jack x so plan was for two big bets on turn and river 10 of hearts good blocker if he sometimes checks back flush draws kicker is like having top pair top kicker since he probably what is the next words here oh would never check back ace king or a king queen river pretty shitty but still wanted to get value from weaker king x and maybe six x so the river will be a jack of diamonds. would probably check if i didn't have a heart. when he raised me i looked deeper at his stats and saw that he was pretty aggressive and could find bluffs like ace of hearts x. so in the end decided my blockers were rather good than bad and decided to bluff catch. was pretty surprised to see his actual hand then. I mean this is like a cliffhanger here. To see his actual hand then didn't think he would ever check that on the flop. Let's see. So I agree with all your assumptions. And I actually hate to bluff catch the river even though I don't know the action. So we are putting villain on a jack and a jack only more or less is what you said. I put him on more tens and king five and all kinds of jacks. So gave him more of a variety of hands. And now we make a nice turn bet, I would say, and face the river jack. Let's see. Now you said without the ten of hearts, you would go for a check call mainly. Now having the block bet against villains showdown value hands like weaker kings makes a lot of sense but damn we said on the flop villain has a freaking jack and now he is raising on that card so i thought we were the people exploiting here just like stroll back we said on the flop he has a jack and now we use our blocker as a reason to call yes maybe maybe villain is over bluffing but it's like for me it's not that consistent right it's like first making the exploit because we say villains check back ranges face up and then in the end it's like blockers give us just like a little navigation in random bluff cash spots right it's like i think way more about the big decisions when we are exploiting is he over bluffing or not over bluffing and i try to find an answer to that here we start on the flop by he checks back at jack it sounds like already we were good in a way let's see but it's like this doesn't seem consistent to me and i would like to just see a fold or even a rejam race sometimes because i would pretty much raise any flush against him here just like putting him on a jack going with my kind of strong reach depends on the exact opponent but let's see now it seems like we face some pocket kings here or or villain is full of shit so maybe yeah one more thing to add is like taking that were saying, okay, you are already exploiting something on the turns or probably you were value heavy, which brings you in that spot with value hands only more or less. And villain risks 19 to win 16 more or less, 17. And there is a chance that yes, your 10 of hearts blocker is okay. And maybe you fold the others that there's a risk that we end up calling too often because we face that same decision over and over again right there for that frequency thing blockers are a cool cool way to navigate but here i just feel the inconsistency which can mess up things so now i can't wait to see his hand okay so we gave him a jack he had a jack all right let's face it like that his flop check it's like i think it's the second worst hand to check back on the flop pocket fours are the worst time to check back i think king jack is the second worst hand even like a pocket jacks are a better check back even though they should bet themselves so i don't know what was happening here but yeah i it's just i want to point out that inconsistency we go with the strong read and yeah i like if the river is a is a seven that you even bet 150 percent or like if it breaks out without hearts yeah nice spot not a great catch i would guess ridiculous play by villain all right let's see start to read out already the next timestamp which says torn between overbet and something else so i can't wait for that spot with the king four here we can yeah small bet should be should be a way to play here and i guess that might be already the spot All right this is the spot he writes down torn between overbet turn and big bet. Went for normal big bet since some straights got there. Big blind can have that I can't. 9-8 offsuit and 4-3 suited. So very, very good arguing here. I like it a lot. This is pretty much which makes all the difference in the world. Did a straight get there that villain has offsuit is the main point here. So is villain defending 9-8 offsuit against our 2.3x open? If there's a chance that yes, overbets are not a thing. End of the thing. It's just he's too strong and he can build a raising range so none of our hands really wants to overbet. If he never has that, the four combinations or three combinations with our blocker of 3-4 suited, where actually 3-4 of hearts mainly the flop we don't care about those offsuit the combos are the ones that matter here we have the extra fact that villain has five six and six seven as well which weakens our queen's kings which are the first hands that want to overbet to get the maximum in now and i think this is one of the spots where you only want to use the 75 percent as kind of normal big bet and keep your range together to not split here too much. And if we were maybe from under the gun and we can discount more 9-8 off suits, we can even go a little crazier. But yeah, I like your reasoning. Looking at the straights that get there, evaluating how strong villains' range is now. Against some others, we can take into consideration how likely they are to check raise stuff like that. eight nine is a double gutter is villain check raising all of them with that container heart is he check raising none of them because he's just freaking passive so it's really that evaluation how often and how much did villain improve here we have five six we have seven six how often does he have that three four nine eight how often does he have that pocket sixes how often does he have that jack six suited well he will, 8. How often does he have that? Pocket 6s. How often does he have that? Jack 6 suited. Well, he will have those two combos. And yeah, that's mainly the difference in those spots. For example, a 4. Let's say the turn is a 4 of spades and we have king 6 just switching the cards from our hand and on the turn. I think that would be way better. 6, 8 suited should be a high frequency check raise. Only a suited hand is getting there. 6-3 suited. Yeah, like not the biggest change in the world. Villain has less of those turn two pairs maybe. And yeah, so that would be a better spot where we can still use an overbet. But this is pretty close.
