### TOPIC: cash hand review river decision
 All right, so hello, hello, hello, hello. Good morning for everyone who was with me watching the WSOP mainstream. So don't wonder too much about the setting and that weird Kirschkernkissen beating pillow in my back. It's really necessary. So I moved my desk to a standing desk today because I can't sit apparently. But yeah, how much action? 0%, but 100% heart. desk to a standing desk today because I can't sit apparently. But yeah, how much action? Zero percent, but all, but a hundred percent hard in there. Yeah, today's session will be a little different than the others because yeah, I actually, since Sunday, I just couldn't sit. So without sitting, preparing like content session is just a little tough, but I was lucky enough that I played quite some some hands put some put some sessions in last week where it was like pretty easy to just select some hands and then put them together for a nice little topic maybe especially after after fully following the big action and some hands again working on where we will only look at big spots pretty much a highlight show. But I want to put in the correct thought process, thinking about, well, it will be about bluff catching and about bluffing, mainly rivers, facing bets and thinking about making bets. How much we like spots, I've prepared some questions, some of them more a little on the fun side, not that Pio-proof this time, about what i think about those spots and i hope i will go a little deeper later working a little with the paint showing how i think about those spots we will look at some simulations as well from the hands we look at to just get a feeling maybe for the thing like what should people do what we guess people are doing wrong to then adjust correctly as always the three questions. And yeah, let's see. Let me share my screen. So we have so far 26 people in here, 16 only in the Kahoot. You will see that now on screen definitely. So I hope I chose the right one, but I guess so let me know if not. So yeah, just make sure to join the Kahoot. Yeah. As I said, it's not about Pio thoughts this time too much. It's more about, well, we will face lots of bluff catch or bluff situations with hands that are somewhat indifferent and Pio, but I have on some of them, a very clear opinion on some of them no opinion at all and i will try to to justify those opinions that you have good takeaways for your games as well big spots is those that that keep us awake during the night so if we mess up with those so at least having a process of how to make the decisions there is pretty important so yeah let's see i just give it one two three more minutes for for everyone to have the chance to join the kahoot and yeah actually we will chaka hello we'll make some breaks as well in between when i need to heat this thing back up and just uh i had another coaching before that wasn't a good idea actually yeah it's just i don't know when this shit will stop all right so is the main event winner your friend yes it's a very good friend of mine and it's been really really sad that i haven't been there now i mean i skipped vegas because i thought it was too stressful after the us just opening up november 8th i would have had to to take like one or two certain flights to fly in to still play the main event and yeah i i thought it was too stressful and we'll be back next year i guess so yeah so maybe let's talk a little bit more maybe some of the guys who haven't been on twitter i prepared a little good luck shrine for my buddy two days ago actually so this is like the maybe this is worth a lot now the player's card from like a self-made self-made game of our team from like four or five years ago so saying there he has like a score eight out of ten for icm only life game only a seven maybe we need to adjust that but okay i guess that should do 23 people in the code so i'm ready. And yeah, we'll start with the first hand right away. And this is the way we'll do it. I will just pull up. Oh, we don't want to see the hands actually. So show hand results. So this went wrong for this part here, but it doesn't matter in this hand. And yeah, we'll just start playing a little. So here we are 250 big blinds deep in a three-bet pot and yeah villain is definitely three betting linear range here and yeah i'm i'm like first thought is how do i change my preflop strategy i want to have more board coverage there will be more boards where i have nuts and he doesn't 250 big blinds deep there's more implied aces kings queens won't stay nuts as they as they do in most spots for 100 bigs so i'm actually calling wider so the question is she should widen his range with some frequencies to just cover boards which usually doesn't happen and just yeah flopping something like this so now any simulation is is pretty wrong because that works with the pre-olved ranges, which have not many fives, not many threes, not many sixes. I have lots of them. So I could think about donking here even, but people do see that. And here we see a pretty large seabed. Actually, it's making them big. And we see a pretty large seabed, which tells us usually we are playing zoom 200 and the whole the the whole session today we will put ourselves into that mindset of everyone else's shit okay that's a big big big helping tool to just put yourself above the others because then you can make your justifications for for place if you do it if you do it in the right way it's just like putting them on hands and stuff where i say okay he threw bets deep he goes big on that flop i doubt that he does that with ace queen of diamonds i doubt that he does that with like king jack of hearts that i expect him to bet small mainly so we freaking go for a large value here and check race and that's pretty clearly the standard play now the question is what happens on that Thank you. freaking go for a large value here and check raise and that's pretty clearly the standard play now the question is what happens on that flush turn that obviously i hit a lot and he hits a lot as well if he plays one size strategy on the flop and has most of his flush draws in there i highly doubt that given given that well board that gives me the clear nut advantage and this is where i make my point here that i say from that point on well this guy is just sitting on freaking queens kings and aces sometimes he has a heart sometimes not and i'm targeting that right i get maximum value now i won't get maximum value later if there's a deuce a four seven or another heart so pio will never bet big, but what I'm doing here is just I'm putting this guy on hand, pretty much. And yeah, he ends up calling. And now the deuce is kind of a problem because he has no reason to bluff catch anymore. My main bluffs got there with a flush draw. Now the second main bluff, the straight draw, I could raise four or five suited pocket fours and play that way got there as well and now i thought what do i do but yeah actually what i did was i say this guy is whatever zoom 200 player he will be shit in a way and yeah i decided to just target that king's aces queens to to have a chance to get a crying call and have the chance. And actually, this will be the question in a second, because I looked something up. You can look up on PokerStars. And then I decided to go for that. And I had a good reason for that. And yeah, he ended up shoving his blocker, which the question is, does it make so much sense here? Does he really have those nut flush draws? I was snap calling here a zero EV catcher and Pio being prepared for that because that was kind of the plan, right? And the main reason here to start a little fancy in the session and still start the Kahoot is, let's see. So for every hand, I will have one question. The question is where's villain from? Because I use the nation read here to say like, okay, this guy is probably capable of bluffing and yeah, so give it, give it the guess here. And it was definitely not thin value. So that was the tank. I have ace of hearts. Let's go. It would be great to see 25 correct answers here. So let's go, guys. I mean, I don't know whether the name P123Draw gave it away, but that was the clear, clear decider for me to go for the block bet because actually only good stuff can happen. And I could show you now something, and this will be our main talk, that if I look at the simulation in that hand, even though preflop ranges are wrong, aces will be like a frequency jam, but definitely not full frequency because well, then the value block ratio just won't fit. but we like people make big frequency mistakes and this is pretty much the topic of the sessions if someone's ready to put it in and he will have that feeling and you know he has that feeling seeing that ace of hearts it's very very likely he overdoes it and this is the spot we want to make use of maybe here i'm pretty sure we can discount lots of flush draws on the flop just experience wise i cannot explain you where that is really coming from but yeah so that was something if villain was from lebanon right i could see myself just jamming because it's likely he just calls his aces right it's just yeah and the others i just was looking for for two more countries, poker wise. So yeah, I hope that most of you are in contention for the title today. Yeah, Mihur, to a Lebanon guy you'd fold, I would just jam myself. So yeah, let's have a look at the next hand though and see which decision we are facing here. And we have fives again. Actually, this was five minutes later and we play against our friend pedro from brazil again and you can expect a good flop so don't worry we face a small c-bet so far again the situation he should be on a linear three betting range i shouldn't have too many fives and threes which in reality i was randomizing pre here maybe calling a little more because we are slightly deep, but it increases my implights. But I'm playing a very different range than in the situation before. So I'm check raising 100% here, just going with a PIO line. And now we get the queen of clubs. So yeah, my hand is just a pretty, pretty, pretty standard barrel here, going somewhat too E-sizing and with like having having the nuts locked up pretty much and now the question here is if we were in villain's shoes and we are facing a check race on the flop a 2e sizing on the turn and then a river jam when the flush gets there let's see what the question is this time so i hope you all got the action we call pre-flop check raise the flop against a small bet a barrel linear sizing on the turn and then jam on that flush card on the river and yeah let's see i like the speed of your decision making mihur that's a good sign let's see for the next question how willing am i to bluff catch in villain's shoes we could have aces with a club we could have a queen we could have well kings with the club we could have anything else yeah just give me a feeling of like how much you like bluff catching here to get an overview. All right. So we get the not at all, which is well, correct or not, but this is what I would approve. And actually let's have a look at the PIO SIM for that one. Oh, let me find that. Here we go. So let's just double check the line first. This should be my range somewhat with the frequency fives in there, sometimes folding nines, eights, sevens, four betting, most of that other shit. But fives, just a very, very, very, very, very, very clear check raise. Villain needs to, what happened here? Oh, no, no donking. Sorry. I was wondering anyway. So so villain is allowed to range that small and bigger size whatever he wants to and now our fives are check race but to think about the river already we need to find out which hands do we need to bluff that villain has a bluff catch in the end 5-4 pocket four sometimes pocket sixes, pocket sevens, seven-six suited, ace-four, and ace-five. All right, so will that happen? Maybe from my side, definitely not from the pool. We have some ace-king, maybe some blocker potential there. So we check-raise, villain ends up calling, turn is the queen of clubs, and we actually use that two--sizing here more or less pocket fives just always betting and we continue not with our 5x but we continue with pretty much all the 6-7 suited well very very very low frequency of like those peers that we pretty much don't have and then ace four with all the suits as well so everything that still has that equity equity, just thinking about is there something regarding, no, okay. So we keep barreling. Let's choose the more frequent sizing. Villain is mainly just answering by calling. He can jam some ace five. Definitely not happening, I would say, but blocking the fives, pretty cool. Just playing against all the flush draws. And he ends up calling the reverse, the eight of clubs so as we see in our frequency already that well pretty much everything hits so we can go crazy seven six of clubs gets there five stay nuts ace queen is still fine enough to to bet where i would say well it's not really you see the difference in eb not yes such a clear value bet where if people overfold that is already not a value bet anymore so block betting here could be it could be more could be a little cooler in real life and now the important part we should fire some of our seven six suited that we get there with and some of our ace four suited and this is pretty much what it is all about if we look at the solver sure villains could come up with some other bullshit hands which well just never happens and what we see here is when we jam aces having clubs or not is just yeah you want to block that ace queen suited it seems like here then you have a call but that's it and i don't think you ever want to call that pocket kings just a clear fold king queen having the trips and clubs or not do not does not matter too much but it's like not a cool call really ace queen is mainly just calling for the split against the other ace queen interesting as well because if we never jam ace queen for value this is not a good call either and yeah they are in the end there's nothing left pretty much and yeah so obviously don't worry Pedro calls his queen after writing something in the chat so it's all fine right if he looks it up in Pio that's fine I. I doubt that I have the 6-7 suiteds and the ace-4 suiteds. I need to make that a profitable catch versus him two minutes after I stacked him. But yeah. So now the first thing is really the bluff catch. Here I want to go a little more into detail and look at paint. I'm not sure how much I use that in older community coachings already. I'm using that a lot in the private coachings I'm giving. And this is how I'm seeing the, well, actually I'm totally lost. I thought I'm talking about something else. Like it feels like that freaking pain is killing it for me. No, that is, that is for later. And yeah, that bluff catching is just really, lots of people ask me about blockers, et cetera, right? I see people call down with like aces with the ace of clubs because they have that, where in the end, well, blockers are just a thing to like have influence on the ratio of bluffs and value. But still the main decision is, does he have enough bluffs or not right does he have too many bluffs bluffing is allowed that's important to understand so it's just is he over bluffing given the sizing he is using or not and how is my blocker influencing that so actually on on twitter i've read just like very very good stuff about the commentary from the wsop main event yesterday i couldn't take it like in every spots they were like oh he's blocking them like no one was bluffing anything on that table and in every spot the commentators were like yeah he's blocking the nuts whether that is in any range or not so it's like yeah definitely definitely a pretty clear call here where yes i don't think we we haven't seen any big bluff. And that is just true for like this last six years or something like that since I follow WSOP main event final tables. And still, I mean, it's correct to play like that because everyone still is just catching. I mean, yeah, really going for it. We had some crazy bluffs of the guy who ended up runner up with some fancy mint check raises, but not really the big ones. All right, let's go to the next tent. Exactly, Sibarino is mentioning it. All right, for everyone who didn't watch that, the bluff catching webinar, it's really there. I focus on like the decision-making process, what is more important and really blockers is an excuse to click on the call button when you want to, right. When you emotionally are attached to something and then it's a very, very bad reasoning, even not looking at the correct things. Like how does it change the ratio? It's just, usually we are talking about it's blocking the nuts. Yes. Great. But maybe it's blocking all the bluffs at the same time, right? Maybe it's whatever, right? It's like, how is it changing the ratio is the only thing. And that already tells that to have a ratio, villain needs to have bluffs in the first place. If we know more about that, and this is why I like having that kind of arrogant approach, just saying everyone is shit here, because in the end we have that experience, right? We are playing here versus a bunch of 1960 nits who are just like not bluffing in big pots, right? Or starting off too tight anyways preflop. And this is just the approach I want to have there. So actually to explain my decisions, because I don't like lots of my decisions we will see in those hands. I played those sessions where forcing myself, I tried to be over the top, to make exactly those observations. Well, I didn't try to light money on fire, maybe in some of the hands we will see, but I was really consciously over the top. So don't worry. But now it's about, this is how we get to see those showdowns, which just makes it way nicer to to see all right so ace four suited under the gun let's make that a little bigger again willem calls and we do see that small on nine seven deuce it's quite a high frequency board still 10 seven deuce would be better from under the gun but it's okay he calls turn we turn the freaking 12 outer maybe even 15 with the ace and yeah double flush draw boards are not over bet that much just makes it very very easy for villain to react just because he has all those deuce x spades 3x spades 7x clubs 9x clubs just big bets are not not pressuring him that much so we want to we want to shift that range split to the river pretty much. I use a normal bet size here on the turn. And we hit a nice card for our range, not necessarily for our hand. And now I'm not 100% sure what the question is. So I'll just look it up. And I'm sure I have a question a question here yeah how happy am i to bluff in this spot talking about not only my hand but every hand i'm getting there with i could have a king jack offsuit i have my ace four of clubs i could have a busted spade draw and i didn't come up with a fourth answer so please please just don't click on it and i know this will make at least one or two of you clicking on that minus all right so now is the thing where we will move to paint so some of you are loving it some of you are hating it maybe actually I thought more now I'm not I'm not hating it here actually I'm hating it with my exact hand. But yeah, let's figure things out. So first, let's see what happened. I go with the 150% sizing, really saying pretty much queen X or tens plus or nothing pretty much. Tens probably going 75%, queen X plus for the 150 sizing. and he ends up calling with 10-9 of hearts. So now the problem, which brings us to our paint games here is really what am I targeting? What is the price? So the queen is a great card. I have the clear range bunch. I can use over bets and I want to use that. So I'm using a 150% sizing. That's my standard overbet sizing when it's not about all ints. So that means I'm risking that and I need 60% fold equity. So yes, keep that in mind. We need 60% fold equity to get more than zero back out of that pot. So if there is a chance that we even have showdown value, we need more than those 60% fold equity to make bluffing better than checking. And now this is how I see that. I see like the range in, you know, my line graphs. Yes. But this is now the range when I think about bluffing, how I see that. And that is split up in three parts. And this situation looks always different. It's like this. There is something like a part one. Let's say the left part is the nutted part. Or actually the other way around. To be in line with the line graphs. So on the right side, we have the nutted part. This is the snap calls or even re-raises where villain is beating value, etc. So not even thinking about catches. not part snap calls raises then there is the big big big big big big part of love catchers right so usually this is the biggest part i try to make it a little representative for for that exact spot love catchers right they sometimes call sometimes fall and then the snap folds, right? Hence that, let's say we think about raising a spot. Well, it's great if villain was bluffing himself because then we maybe have the first 20% fold equity here. Or something like here, villain is check calling four or five of spades on the turn, not just because he gets the correct odds. He doesn't want to fast play there because he cannot really rep much. Well, I'm winning against that, but still it helps me to have the fold equity. Maybe it's like he can have king, jack of spades and check calls the turn again with, maybe that's the better example if I think about bluffing my jack 10 or something like that. So this is how I see it in every situation. And sometimes we have very, very different. Those situations can look very different. Sometimes villain's super protected. Let's think about that. Pocket fives and queen five, three. Turn queen, river eight, bringing the backdoor flush. Villain has queens, okay? Villain has all or some of the nut flushes, so he definitely is protected. Then villain doesn't have any snap folds. Villain has like kings plus, right? It's like snap fold really meaning busted draws where he doesn't think for a second, right? Even pocket kings are there. So that was a spot where, well, depending on my sizing, I need a certain amount of fold equity. And here I can represent that. Well, the full equity starts obviously here. I need 60% with my sizing. So here I need villain to let's say, talking about the representation here, I need villain to fold more than 50% of his bluff catchers in that spot with the pocket fives. Well, I used a smaller sizing that where I only needed like 40% of fold equity or something like that, maybe even less. Well, to make profit here, I only need him to fold like 40% of his bluff catchers. But this is pretty much what I do not really know what people react with. This is call like the volatility of my bluff baby in a way right this is this is what can happen let's make it that way this is every answer right if someone is super sticky all right we were talking about lebanon before then well he will call all bluff catchers that's like the case scenario, but I know those guys will still fold their snap falls. This is very important when we play against recreational players, for example, realizing how many snap folds they get to the river with because, well, they might call every bluff catcher, but maybe we just use a small sizing where we need like 20% fold equity, but he has 30% snap falls. That would be great. Here, the volatility for my bluff is something like that. Like really right side, worst case, left side worst case scenario, villain is calling all bluff catchers, right side, he's folding all bluff catchers. That's the upside and the downside of me bluffing. So now I need to evaluate in which situation am I in? Often, the likeliness of people calling their bluff catchers is a function of how many nuts they are having. So I, for example, love to bluff into ranges where they have nuts. because that's an excuse for people to say like, yeah, I'm folding that bluff catcher. I'm super protected anyways, which is true, right? They will never fold a hundred percent, but they will always fold maybe 50 when I only need 30, 40% fold equity. So this is something I love, right? Sometimes we all know that we, we pretty much know villain's hand, Bet, check, bet. He has, I don't know, weak top pair or a strong middle pair. We know his hand. He knows we know his hand. We know that he is not bluffing. We know that he is capped. We go crazy, but he has exactly the problem. He never has nuts and he knows about it, which makes it very, very, very likely that he calls his bluff catchers, at least for some people. And then if we use large sizings where we actually need 70%, 80% full equity, really pushing it, then, well, it will be tough in the end if he pretty much sits on a 50-50 decision, like he has it or not, because people just like to end up with 50, 50, which won't help us. Well, when we need 70% full equity. So like, this is something where I try to get breeds on those, I call them black or white spots, right? It's like, it's everyone knows the situation. It's just, you call or you don't, you have a freaking bluff catcher. Let's go. Right. And it's not many people really caring about the sizing too much thinking about about the frequency to answer correctly. No. It's like I'm overfolding everything on those stakes. A hundred percent. You can go crazy against me. That's fine. But it takes some effort. All right. And now coming to this, to that representation, I think a normal size bet with anything that has no spades and clubs is totally fine right then we have the first snap falls villain is calling ace 10 of clubs flop and turn and he will fold river he's doing that with spade this is why mainly spades are the worst bluff here because well you're just missing the snap falls in villains range but with two busted flush draws against right again arrogant view everyone is shit here yeah they are sitting mainly on just showdown value he sits on a nine he sits on a seven he sits on a deuce and my sizing here which is a correct sizing to use but i want to do it value heavy just like puts him into like a 50 50 spot with all those hands right he ends up calling this hand and i'm happy to look that up and in pi as well i think i solved that for you where is this under the gun nine seven juice with two spades so right what we could do now what lots of people are doing when reviewing is like okay let's double check our strategy ace four of clubs yes we can check we can bet on purpose i'm c betting higher frequency because people aren't check raising enough we talked about that often enough he's definitely not playing like that he calls turn three of clubs we are not really over betting much so got that spot correctly of ace four of clubs i can bet or i can check both is fine i decide to bet river is queen of diamonds so so far villain is doing fine with the 10 nine of hearts call queen of diamonds check I double check let's have a look what about spades okay we are pretty much never bluffing the ace of spades that's important ace four of spades somehow if we want to and we are using a lot of that 150 percent sizing and ace four of clubs actually is a very high frequency bluff with a big sizing well because you use the big sizing with that one because you need to fold out more than just the snap folds right the the full shit sizing is just attacking the snap folds and the the bigger one is just uh yeah targeting more and villains reaction should look like oh like this 10-9 suited just pretty much always being a fold jacks 10s being a fold king nine being sometimes a fold seven five seven six this is what i mean exactly with that 50-50 feeling. I put myself in a situation where I need villain to fold almost 100% of his 10-9s. I just don't see it in that situation. And this is why I don't think that this is a great spot to bet. I mean, the large bet makes a lot of sense. I want to do it with my value bets. Are you always using the same overbet sizing on the river with aces with aces kings yes and you can't really bluff this specific opponent when he doesn't fold his 9x yes exactly or i can say i can bluff them with a small sizing then he should call most of his 10-9 and that he does so is totally fine maybe he over folds his ace queen on the turn that would that would help a lot right but here with the smaller sizing i don't want to have clubs and spades because then it's enough if he just folds his clubs and spades. If I have freaking Jack-10 of diamonds and I can't help myself but bluffing the turn, I think that will be fine in a way. We have the Queen of diamonds, Jack-10 of diamonds. We just bluff with a small sizing. You see the insane EV difference. It's still, well, 27 bucks with checking back or $2.70. I just added one digit there. And yeah, you see the small bet just prints money, right? And if you see the reaction, you don't need villain to fold anything. You just need him to fold like his, well, the king apparently, because the blockers are worse but just like those ace ten of spades ace x so it's really yeah this is just representing lots of spots what are we targeting what do we need villains to fold how many snap folds do we have how do we think this guy that's like a very personal thing how is this guy reacting in this certain spot with his bluff catchers? What we like doing a lot is to only think about that part. It's like, no, he's a calling station, so I'm not bluffing. Yeah, probably not right if this here exists, right? This guy's never calling, so we are always bluffing. Well, and then we overbet into the nuts. I don't i don't know obviously he has a calling range so that's really something i want you to to learn from now to really on the table it's always different but we want to step away take a step away from the table to evaluate the situation it's a pure bluffing situation i have zero showdown value maybe my ace four even has some show actually. So yeah, we need that amount of fold equity because this is the sizing we want to be using. This is pretty much determined by our value range. And yeah, then we decide, okay, how bluff or value heavy do we want to be? There are lots of options. There's no black or white. There's in between. And you can do something like, yeah, my ace four, I know it's a bluff here, right if you work a lot with payo like i knew that as a bluff and spades i thought it's not at all but that's that's close enough for me it's like yeah and then you say like yeah but it's not like one of the great ones that are printing right we have seen the jack ten of diamond bluff that one was printing that ace four of clubs check and bet have same ev right checking back winning against king king jack of clubs all good all right so that's so far let's see let's actually now i'm going position by position now we move to middle position and we have pocket eights and actually can i because i want to piece that pillow again i don't know what the speed is. I just run it for you. And I'm back in one and a half minutes, I guess. All right. So you've seen that already. All right. So let's just go through it quickly again. So I defend middle position versus button against a 21-17 guy who seems to 3-bet on the normal side. I'll stop it here again. Thank you. We defend middle position versus button against a 21-17 guy who seems to 3-bet on the normal side. I'll stop it here again. Now we should be good, right? Why such a large continuation bet on the flop? Oh, this is a check-raise. So we defend out of position against a 3-bet. And yeah, flop, ace, 6-5. Villain c-bets small, and I decide to check-raise that hand. We have already seen on that queen 5-3 that those pockets that at least still can make a backdoor straight are somewhat cool, especially when they unblock villain's folding range. So villain doesn't have too many king-8 suiteds here, right? I don't want to have like a 10 in my range for example because you could see that jack 10 queen 10 suited stuff like that so pocket eights definitely find check rates sometimes we'll look that up in pio as well and villain calls and now we bink the two outer which is yes this is as well why we choose those hands because we can still make nuts against this ace king and yeah i go to e or something about that any hotkey i'm having and the river nine i don't worry too much about probably makes it more likely that he folds his bluff catchers but i can tell you already right think about if i was bluffing what kind of spot are we having here right i would say here's some snap calls definitely he could have like a7 suited we have seen his hand already he has mainly bluff catchers ace king i don't see any snap falls not at all actually it's it's very similar to that bottom bottom representation i would say pocket a it's definitely a good enough for a value gem and yeah now let's ask question again. Maybe I gave away too much already, but how often do I call Ace-King on the river in villain's shoes? Turn 8, river 9. All right, we're getting in that direction. So pretty much similar spot in a way to that queen 5-3, being protected, not having any snap folds. So mainly sitting on bluff catchers, while the range is pretty, pretty good for whatever villain might have check-raised with. So let's find that hand here in Pio and quickly look it up. So ace, five, six. All right. So not really donking. A villain can see that some frequency, definitely not full frequency. So having a read there that villain is too wide maybe increases his snap folds. And like, sure, then he has that more often as well, but those our hands that we are not necessarily losing to so villain c bets and we see five six is clearly check raising five six obviously and now our potential bluffs again sevens pocket eights threes fourths deuces all right right pocket is a two outer backdoor straight is some additional equity six seven suited seven eight suited eight nine suited that's it you know the run out already right so what will be bluffs on the river force threes deuces said that already i'm not sure what i said okay so i was check raising villain definitely calls and the turn is i don't know which eight was it eight of hearts and we see how much that hits our range we can freaking range bet whatever we check raised with we can bet like all threes twos fours we only have them low frequency keep bluffing with four or five we added equity with sevenss, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. We can go freaking crazy. So let's do that. We should jam some ace king because we have so many equity hands with like seven, seven, eight, four or five in a way, which is never happening in real life. And I wouldn't suggest to do so. And yeah, so this is mainly us having those full shit hands in there forces us to still continue quite a lot. And now on the nine, we improve even more and can still barrel very, very, very high frequency. Every set for value where we see like, yeah, it's very close already, right? Because villain is protected. Pocket eights to make that a value jam william needs to call some stuff that is worse it's really really really really close right i actually thought about it on the river whether i go for some fancy block bet that is not not offered here given the stack to pot ratio but now what should be his reaction is yes calling nines eights well calling his nuts obviously and aces and that's pretty much enough that's really pretty much enough he needs to call like some frequency ace king and this only right always bluff catchers are only a tool to prevent villain from bluffing with full shit right to have too much ev with full shit And the only full shit we are having to get there with is 4-5, 4-3 deuces. Where now the question is, for us on the real tables, is anyone ever having that? I haven't seen deuces, 3s, 4s there in a lifetime. Maybe 4s. I haven't seen following up 4-5 all day long. So it's not happening and then when this is the case well we are playing versus value range only and actually we are losing probably 1074 dollars or 107.40 on those stakes with our ace king call so here we can do the one thing can look up our hands in pile call down ace king and say like yeah it's a frequency call all good or we can understand the situation know what is right understand what people are doing wrong not check raising enough shit to follow up on those kind of runouts and just laugh at them and fold 100 of our freaking bluff catchers in situations like that. So again, I'm here on the fold everything side. And I guess I have a very, very clear reasoning for that. You always raise pocket eights on the flop in this session. Yes. Usually no. Usually I play like close to, to pile here in that session. I was really like, I went into the session. let's force it in every single spot where i feel like it's somewhat okay so there was there was like some some i had a lot of fun playing let's let's take it that way all right so next spot that was only only one mp hand let's see something here cut off okay one more cut off and oh my favorite hand let's go we open raise king jack off c-bet king seven three so far so standard villain calls turn queen great card for us if you're more interested in the strategy here uh definitely watch the bet turn bet bet big and polar or something like that community coaching about turn barrels to choose sizings i definitely want to use an overbet here in that situation the problem is that we have a lot of hands in between and king jack is pretty much the overbet line that's the one that we like yeah we somehow want to bet 75 to have another street of value. With 150, we need to check back pretty much any river. So yeah, I went for the overbet because I was greedy in that session. And I just go for it. I explained to you my mindset there. He ends up calling. River is a queen, which yes, yes ace queen improves but king seven king three gets counterfeit and this is right you can think about it like i think that's not the question here but is that one of the spots where we like bluffing looking at this year villain has some snap calls i think seven threesrees and king three king seven are like mainly check raising flop or turn i mean the sets so he's not too protected some of the ace queen floats maybe if he wasn't three betting pre-flop that's like the nut part that snap calls then he has no snap folds again i would say every seven is sitting there ah he might have jack ten. Everything busts. Whatever. I don't know. It's like really showrunner only. There's not a single percent snap fold. Pretty much he is always a king. That's correct. So I turned around the exploit or like said, okay, I'm never, ever bluffing that spot. Maybe against some other people, not never, ever, but against a weak, unknown player. I'm not trying to move him off the king but at the same time i try to be freaking greedy like a moron and go crazy and not jam like this is a check back in pile right but i definitely want to have one more street here okay and now guys we burn some money okay i burned that money for you i had that session in mind already and um we face this year and now let's go to the question oh lord okay everyone who has a good feeling and knows our people here don't mock me write down his hand in the chat please okay i'm surprised i gave him another range i mean not not range but i don't see the king queen like i see the the super nuts not scrolling around and like it's then it's like either min race or going for it it's like i don't i don't see the king queen for like the small race but okay let's let's see what the question is we We are not talking about calling here, guys. What about jamming here? Let's put him on pocket threes and try to wrap our king-queen. Against his race, we're definitely jamming sevens and king-queen and kings and queens. We need our bluffs, guys. okay okay that's a little sad so i mean i spoiled the whole show i obviously went for it that one was for you but he tanked he tanked and like i mean i said i didn't want to light like 100 of money on fire because i really that sizing experience was i don't put him on like the king queen definitely not it's like really the I have a queen I want to raise thin for value so I thought I have some full equity potentially so here is paint let's try to make that graph so how does it look like in that spot so we all agree that this guy is never bluffing that sizing? So we all agree on that, I guess. So snap folds are non-existent. Villain might have some king-queen. Let's add some good stuff, good amount there. And then Villain has bluff catchers. The problem is that his bluff catchers are trips that he runner-runnered and decided to check-raise on the river with with the problem is is he realizing that this is bluff catchers so actually in his mind it might be even more like this and then we are playing into like a call only range talking about upside downside right about that arrow here we're like like i mean let's let's call that the bluff catchers and i mentioned that exactly his river sizing might point you are way too nice right so we need more arrogance in that statement this guy is a freaking idiot not personally but poker wise right this guy really sucks he obviously has it he won't understand i definitely should never try to make him fold trips because this is what i just mentioned he's not even realizing that he has a bluff catcher and then i think this is our best case worst case scenario best here like again where is the here it's okay and now we can double check our sizing risk reward is a big thing right we are risking an additional we need to we need to we are risking 210 210 to win this year 162 so actually we only need 50 fold, okay, like, yes, if you fold every ace queen and queen 10, we might have that. The downside is that we have 0% fold equity and calling is definitely not an option. All right. So yes, very important to have that mindset and really, again, realizing those those spots obviously it feels great to jam over the top and get a fold or whatever here probably if i would do something like that if i was the big blind i would have a hundred percent folding range then because i'm never playing king queen like that i try to go for the last value and well i guess i ran into some some too much nuts because he did float me and own me with the queen 10 offsuit. But okay, right? Nothing I could do. When my job is to force it in the session, I need to follow through. Okay, so it's all fine. It doesn't hurt too much. How did the guy even float? Yeah, he clicked the call button. He had some plans. All right, next next one king nine suited button versus big blind versus a zoom 200 rec i've seen him every single session i guess so i didn't know him at the time but okay we see that small he calls turn is a flush draw for us i give him some credit after seeing him for a couple of sessions and just think that he can check raise some of his 7-5 and 5-2s. So actually the 3 is not such an awesome card if he check raises correctly, which again, wrong approach. He sucks. Obviously he plays soon 200, so he sucks. Should be the right approach. And he probably still has all that and I should go 75% sizing only. I went for the overbet. It's all fine in PIO, but it's a mindset thing, right? So he decides to go for a small manually sized check race. And I guess we are just priced in. So I don't see too many nut flush draws here. So my outs should be always clean. It seems very weird that sizing because it's not planned to go direction all in. So in so if you have five seven here and if you have five seven you count already if i make it 56 now then there's 128 in the middle and we have 150 left no that's not what you do you scroll up right you scroll up then you make it 68 here or something like that to have something 75 to pot size left on the river to jam your freaking straight get it in against whatever so i thought for a second about really reading him on full shit could we check back on the flop when we know villain is a wreck yes absolutely if he is really really really good king nine is a clear mix on the flop yes but no we pretend everyone sucks uh so here i actually thought about really randomly jamming it in because i don't i don't believe a shit in that sizing it's that another maybe a smaller read people are planning ahead and thinking about their sizing when they have it and this is just what they randomly click click when he might have something, right? So I'm definitely calling, but with a plan that I'm happy to make some moves there against what's just jamming against a random block bet or whatsoever on the river. We are lucky this time and we face that block bet. We're like, all right. He has a five. We obviously rip it in. And yeah, next question. How much do I like a bluff if I don't have the nuts? Let's say I have ace queen with the ace of diamonds, pocket kings with the king of diamonds. All right. So here, I actually don't hate it too much, right? We don't want to be the freaking super nits. And I explained to you why. I don't find too many full bluffs, but so far in all the the spots we faced a spot where villain is only answering by calling where he is super protected or sits on showdown value all the time here we face a sign of weakness a weird sizing on the turn but i cannot discount six three and three four like a hundred percent i put him somewhat on a five but that's still random but if he check raises a flush draw he jams here all day long so yeah i think we have like i don't know whether it's here but we have our first snap falls and there are no natural bluffs for me so really just given the sign of weakness it's not one of my favorite spots but it's not like one that i would never take and yes very good risk reward we are risking 154 to win what is it 172 that's very different to betting jamming two times pot 150 percent very very good thing and important to mention here where the situation for villain feels the same he has it or he doesn't is he bluffing or not we're here it's very believable i prefer to just just i'm 100 happy with discounting pretty much all flushes here so what i actually love as a better strategy than a polarized bluffing and value range is just the value bluff to just jam my fives as well whether he folds or not i don't care because i have the same hand i obviously love when he folds but there's no downside if i can really discount the flush flushes so this is the one i prefer slightly here than just like randomly ripping in like pocket kings but yeah isn't kings a better fold on the turn i would fold all one pairs already facing that check race against any normal sizing yes but that sizing really triggered me like that it's that's i don't know i cannot that's just really an experience thing not planning ahead the sizing at all like really if i have to put him on a hand he ended up calling it would be something like that on the turn like really no kidding it's just that i don't know could be seven eight of diamonds as well on the turn but it's it's really that yeah kind of kind of thing we're here now again we have the problem he calls definitely because of blocker which in this spot is fine but it's really really tough to to do that in the right way but if i'm bluffing here i'm probably having the ace of diamonds in my hand while thinking about it it doesn't make any sense right i'm discounting any ace of diamonds in villains range so why should i freaking bluff like need to have that blocker right probably better to have black tents yeah and in this spot it's just i couldn't bluff any any shit because I don't need that ace of diamonds. So his ace of diamonds is pretty good to just block seven, eight of my nuts that I'm definitely playing in that way, some frequency at least. So, but really it's about stepping back from the table, thinking about the spot and evaluating it in a way. Right here, the big difference is really that he showed us weakness compared to all the stuff before where we are attacking a non-weak range i mean especially the king jack versus queen dead all right so actually this is taking longer than i thought this is good i thought we have a quick session today but i like it a lot and let's just move to the next hand and now maybe and i guess you would shove on the turn any value hand after reading into that sizing not really like if i put him on full trash i don't want to fall like i thought about just stranding a random flush draw there to just get the job done like my pocket kings i'm happy to call and then call brick rivers if i have a clear read i'm just it's it's really just a feeling is a bad word but like experience zoom 200 yeah if i would play that on a daily basis I would have a clear read, I'm just, it's, it's really just a feeling is a bad word, but like experience zoom 200. Yeah. If I would play that on a daily basis, I would have a better feeling for him or, or clear reads. Let's take it that way. All right. Next hand button. Again, we open raise pocket threes. If you watched my streams two weeks ago and three weeks ago, then we have played a lot against this guy. He is actually a decent aggressive wreck or actually an over aggressive wreck using lines that do not exist just for pure aggression so yeah i love playing him and because it's always interesting and yes you you can sometimes maybe bluff him sometimes you can maybe even bluff catch so we play that three bad pot here we get a 984 which is definitely fine for our pocket threes to start with he cannot bet range he can still bet high frequency but we have some check folds there or some ace high check downs he starts by checking yeah i thought because of the spr not letting him draw out on you if it was like yeah then it's like more you jam your random blocker shit right something like if i somehow double barrel a six or something on that queen six four this is what you want to jam to just like have the last blocker and this is really the stuff that gets outdrawn from something i think i can clearly read him that his shit is like either kind of a random flush draw or something around the five is just too clear that i can make good river decisions jamming in position Thank you. is like either kind of a random flush draw or something around the five is just too clear that i can make good river decisions jamming in position is only a thing you want to do when there's nothing good happening for you on the river it's like that you have a six there you don't want to see a single card but you know you are just ahead all the time pretty much then then jamming makes a lot of sense when we want to click back turn yes if our read is that clear yeah that's the perfect one that's like really charge his draw like attack his hand if we know that he has a five or diamonds then we want to use exactly that sizings to make those hands puke but that's tough to know tough to know all right back to this hand here he starts by checking pocket threes i can sometimes step but mainly it's just to check back Hope to check down Tough to know. All right, back to this hand here. He starts by checking pocket threes. I can sometimes stab, but mainly it's just to check back. Hope to check down versus ace king, ace queens. And here we have a seven. And this is a very, very good card for me. I have all pocket sevens. I'm never stabbing them on the flop. I have seven, eight suited. I have position on a board that is getting more drawy. And yeah, just he shouldn't bet too often. He's like just building a pot where I have everything. And he steps even small. Now maybe your first little test, what hands do you put him on? Just not one hand this time. Everyone who answers at least three hands, please. Three hands, write me three hands while I heat that thing up again. Just write them next to each other, right? Like that I have an overview something like that right three hands all right ace 10 king 9 queen jack 10 9 jack 9 queen 9 king 8 all right someone someone is a believer ace king wow ace 9 ace 8 all right let's start actually this time let's start with pile where is nine eight four button nine eight four here we go all right so villain checking i'm checking back threes mainly and as i said sevens mainly or i said all the time check check river is the seven of spades oh la la villain check 88 in theory small bets doesn't exist at all. So is that working when you're solving from the turn? Because I didn't run it for too long. Hope that works. Oh, no, it doesn't work. Okay. Yeah, so we see, first of all, yeah, it's not a thing. Villain, over-aggressive villain using sizing, that is not a thing. Okay, so at least we clearly don't want to over fold. So I have a clear call. I have a freaking peer. And now River is an ace. And we see this here. So let's have a look. He steps small. Oh, something went wrong. Let's load that again. Okay, check, check, seven of spades, small bet. We need to continue guys, right? So he is full of shit or has an eight or a seven, but good stuff is happening. Call. River is the, what was it? Ace of hearts? Yes. Ace of hearts. And now we are in a non-existent game tree. Now it's fine for him block sometimes okay he does block what's your line raise raise raise raise raise raise raise raise raise okay hold call okay i ended up calling in this one we see full full want to raise but I don't know what we're repping. We will have a look at that because this was only the question for the chat. Now we are talking about a range and good luck with this question here. How often should we raise the river with our full range here? How the pen played out? Now this is the first solver question. This is not my feeling. This is just how often should we raise. All right. So this is what we always forget, right? We have the feeling on the turn already, non-existent range, then river again, block bet. He's either a weak value or full of shit, right? So first of all, like I said it, first thing, I don't want to overfold. Like potentially full of shit, this is the only thing, right? It's like we know him, potentially full of shit, no overfolding. That's the only thing where i really want to make bluff catches so what does that look like here all right let's switch it like that way now let's say we think about bluff raising right so snap calls maybe one or another trap but like definitely not the type of player who trappy trappy uses non-existent lines. Maybe he has pocket nines once in a lifetime. I don't know. Right. So don't want to make that a zero, but I don't see it. And then he is either weak or he's full of shit. Let's make that line here. I don't say he's more weak value than full of shit. We get a price for calling. We need to be good 20 freaking percent of the time so yes if he is sometimes full of shit we will always have that so what weak value are you beating in this hand i'm not beating any weak value i'm just bluff catching versus his 10x and jack x bullshit which he has offshoot so this is understanding risk reward this is again same thing stepping back both for bluff catching and for for bluff raising so this year okay this year thinking about only this year is the what you do if you go big on the river then i call clearly less and i raise less as well and i'm protected because well I have still all the ace highs and the two pairs in my range. So yes, but thinking about that, given the price, understanding that it's not he has it or he doesn't situation. It's not 50-50. It's, is there a chance that one out of five times he's full of shit? Where if you ask it yourself that way, we are, it's very easy to answer yes. If you know that guy being aggressive and at the other like that helps you for bluffing yourself as well right if he's either weak or full of shit and you think about jamming or even raising small it's like here we can risk 160 to win 90. That's not the best risk reward, but if he has no snap calls that's okay in hindsight do you think raising is the super i love both options it's i'm not sure about the hand selection which one i like more but yeah i think i can just jam random shit right just calling the peers jamming random shit and now let's let's just look that up right so we find the 20 race and this is just what we see right jack 10 no need to race on the turn there against a non-existent line let him hit something with the super nuts ace king already close in a way i don't think i think i can easily race that all the time this is just because pio traps a little more and then our main value are pocket sevens ace eight a7 ace four and then actually pio because pio's playing versus ranges that make sense even though it's low frequency it takes the lookalike right it takes the seven six eight six as like lookalike to ace eight a, 8-7, 4-5 to the 5-6. Somehow the pocket fours are set. Threes call, call, it's like that. Yeah, indifferent call, but yeah, you see that king-jack off is just a, I mean, this is all 0% bluffs. Like if there's a chance, like clearly not overfolding here. So I love both both options my main goal is not to over fold and just showing that spot because this is one where well raising is as good maybe even better and yeah given and just showing again that structure like having that structure in your mind and applying that in game to have an understanding what spot we are in right instead of like ah he might have nines maybe he has an ace ah he won't fold what am i wrapping it's like yeah know your We'll be right way. Okay, so let's go to the blinds.. Actually not a single small blind hand I found that was interesting or did fit to the spot. So oh this one another one of my lots of favorite hands. So guys let's hit some value hands again. We defend the big blind versus Mr. Carlos CRG. I won't ask you where he is from. I don't know. But we hit a set and face a 65% c-bet. I hope. Let's double check. Everyone should see that. We defend the big blind and face a 65% c-bet on that board. I can tell you, Pio is not betting big on that board. Next question. I want to know Willem's hand. Okay. So I'm very proud that you found your way into the arrogance mode here, right? He bets big where it doesn't exist. It's obvious what he has. He has it always he has it always it's like yeah important we have pocket fives with a diamond here we are folding guys maybe with the queen we are calling once because well our two outers three outers clean to two pair i don't know something like four five four six is what i want to have here or four six is even better with a clean two pair outs but i'm ready to make those big turnfalls and now me who is mentioning it this is now i want to ask next but you wrote the answer already we need we have one job here and that is not building fancy check raising ranges like having bluffs or shit like that no we need to get money in the middle before we won't get the money in the middle anymore sometimes there's a five of diamonds on the turn sometimes there's a three of diamonds on the turn sometimes there there's any other diamond on the turn sometimes there's a king and he has a set fuck it right or he's not stacking off his ace queen anymore so and someone who is betting big on that board we know their hand right arrogance mode but if it's sometimes not correct it's totally fine right if you clicked on the blue one that's totally fine and probably more close to the truth right but this is just meaning he has it he's definitely like i don't know people like i have the king of diamonds jack of clubs that's a good one for the big bet now no they click on the small button so what i hate i hate what i did here i was in autopilot this is tell me what is bad right small this is a board that i should check raise with high frequency because runouts will be favorable for me with that those trades around the deuce and the four yes but i don't want to play like keep a high spr like this is totally wrong thinking right i need to get the money in now this is 50 button i should click pot or even bigger right and then overbet jam the turn fuck it exactly so he calls we get the double flush draw and now actually here i remember the hand i realized okay i fucked up on the flop right if i bet if i check raise correctly here there's 100 in the middle and i i have 150 left and we can easily jam that shit right bio will tell you to see that here 100 because well the six is obviously an awesome card for us but villain won't know he's not living in the 5-3 student world so he has ace queen and now i want to make up for that mistake and obviously go for the check jam right it's like he has kings ace queen he will bet that on that board most likely i check jam he cannot fold puts me on four or five of diamonds we are good right so fuck my life he did check back so i thought like maybe he still has a flush draw himself so on the river i still think he has ace queen or kings and somehow check back or he has nothing and what you write now is not correct jamming doesn't make any sense if i jam my target is ace queen something like that which is now clearly betting itself right so i don't need to attack something that is betting itself so i just go again for the check jam yeah and like if he has a 10 nine of diamonds and my bluff now i get still the maximum so i think that decision is pretty clear here but guys don't don't worry it's like don't worry we got him so it's uh yeah and it's like again guys i played like or four sessions last week. So it's not like I'm pulling those hands out of the database of a gazillion hands. This is happening on a daily basis, right? If I check raise pot size on the flop and jam the turn, I love my play here. I needed to get lucky with that brick river, right? I definitely messed up that hand. I'd lost lots of EB by not getting it in on the turn. If the river is the five of clubs, I get a block bet in and that's it. Or maybe a normal bet. But yeah, this is really where we can win a lot of money with very small reads. Okay, I'm not sure whether there's one more question. I think this was the last question. Wow, Was it question number eight? I think I have one or two more hands, but I didn't prepare questions. Eight out of eight. All right. Let's double check the winner and then look at one more hand. Wow. That was freaking close. Good job. Here we go. Okay. So very nice. I enjoyed it a lot. I hope you did too. Let's have two quick more hands, okay? Jack-9 suited against another freaking... They all suck, right? So we check call. Flush gets there. Big sizing. I'm not sure. Let's freaking fast play that. If he has the nuts, he has the nuts. But the Queen of Diamonds, or 10 of Diamonds, 9 of Diamonds nine of diamonds jack of diamonds he's coming from mp not much left here i like my sizing a lot and we rip it in on the river right and obviously i have flushes only is my range he calls me down with zero percent equity again one of those spots where we definitely don't want to have a single bluff and yeah against weaker stationing players so again that fits pretty well big bet on the turn means he has something we have better let's get the money in all right and this one the last one again one where i tried to invest money for you guys but ended up and not invest money really i tried to set money on like yeah to burn some money here little open raises i3 bet he calls that flop is a check back with ace queen most of the time i don't want to bet fold with like having those spades we could argue for people not check raising enough but actually it doesn't help me if they are check calling we're over folding because i rather play against two weak players against all the ace jack, ace 10. Turn 10, facing a big bet. My hand now is actually a fold, close fold. Just blocking the nut flush draw is very bad. Blocking the, my value with ace queen is coming from him betting ace, ace of spades and ace, ace of hearts, and then giving up brick rivers. So actually calling the ace queens without the suits here is better i was unaware and messed up here but okay and then we get the hearts here and again talking about one last read we are having here he bets pretty much well little over two thirds on the turn river gives me lots of new flushes i play lots of hearts like that and i might check back weak king x lots of, if we think about bluffing in his shoes, one last graphic here. I'm definitely protected. Lots of nuts with the flushes is lots of nuts always. I just count king X in there as well, even though king X is a bluff catcher. Just meaning, yes, no one expects a king to fold. And then we have, let's make it like that. Right. And then we have maybe some bluff catchers right it's like not really that i'm i'm definitely folding like the ace queen of clubs right maybe i have some 10x with a heart to go with something like that some bluff catchers but not too many so it's a very very different spot where i'm not sure whether yeah i mean he needs something to to bet big there so thoughts on calling to bluff hard rivers maybe too thin anyway when he bombs turn yeah but you know the thing is that bluffs that we are drawing on are not really money making money that's the problem so it's rather something we want to know where our eb is coming from and it's not like we hit a heart and then we have a big ev spot if that was the case that, that's okay. But yeah, the other thing is like, do we need hearts to bluff that always? If hearts come and he chooses a certain sizing, how much is our ace of hearts worth when this is potentially not even in his range? So yeah, this is maybe pretty much pile learning, right? The ace queen of clubs has a clear plan. Hitting a jack, hitting an ace, or winning against the give-ups when non-spade non-hard river but okay back to that we have seen him betting turn two-thirds he faces that type of situation given my range improving on that king of hearts by a lot and he goes for the casual size up from two-thirds to yeah to 82 that's the biggest sign of strength we have out there okay So this is another one of those King Jack spots. I'm like, yeah, exactly. I called for the Ace of Hearts. Let's freaking go. I think now facing this bet, we are targeting something like this here. Just his upsize means for me that it's way less likely that he has a snap fold actually way less likely that he has nuts as well it's more like that then actually my blocker gets a little irrelevant and yeah so it's like that spot where against a very against a good thinking player maybe that's the perfect spot i think just i don't want to fight against pure strength and yeah anyways you know what my mindset for that session was. We go with it. I was expected to just get the freaking tank call from King Jack offsuit, but we got it through. But again, this is a bluff I actually don't like, right? We are, we are risking $200 to win those 150. We need him to fold 60% while, right? Folding 60% means nothing else, but fold your snap folds and most of your freaking bluff catchers, right? So actually that leads to a risk, like upside downside potential of, well, actually like this here. Oops, I were like, our upside is just way smaller than our downsides. And that's the freaking problem. We want to find those spots where our upside is just way smaller than our downsize and that's the freaking problem we want to find those spots where our downside is rather small by finding air and villains range that he cannot do anything with and our upside potentially very very big this is what we are looking for so maybe not or coming coming to pretty much the conclusion of The session takeaways from today is really try to step back and really see the situation as it is, right? It's not, it's so easy to get lost. Yeah, I have the ace of hearts. I have to do something. I have this, I have that. He's repping this or that, talking about combos. No bullshit, right? He's freaking sizing up. I'm super protected. I should have my value raises. So I i should add my bluff raises but what's the situation i'm actually facing to then make a decision my goal is not to copy pile right my goal is to be value heavy where i should be value heavy and to be bluff everywhere i want to be bluff heavy where it's just against aggression it's very tough to ever want to be bluff heavy since we figured out that aggression is value heavy just all the time at the same hand maybe maybe yeah so that's the main takeaway for today every big spot maybe do it for your last session maybe do it for your next session take your big river spots try to to draw those graphs happy to when you share them in the in the cash game hands analysis have some some some talk about that what's the upside what's the downside we mainly had things where we decided that we do not really want to bluff the pocket threes as like a call down option race option against the full of shit line of odisha well i don't know whether how he wants to be pronounced i had pronounced in that way was like the one exception, I guess. And yeah. So thanks everyone for tuning in as always leave, leave, leave feedback in the, in the, in the channels. Sorry for not making a fine presentation today. I just couldn't. I mean, I hope it's stuff is getting better soon for me and yeah. See you. See you around guys in Slack and have a good one.
