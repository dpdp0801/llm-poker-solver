### TOPIC: cash low pairs
 Okay, so glad to see the 24 of you here. We have quite some plans for today. And yeah, actually, I played a little session yesterday. I felt so incredibly rusty after, I think, like six weeks off with Christmas and my longer vacation combined. But yeah, I made up my mind. I thought this is a fun topic a little. It's kind of special. So yesterday I was actually recording while playing live some Zoom and I was like, yeah, I want to focus on that. Probably it won't come up. And actually there was not really a spot where low peers came up. But to start the topic right away and jump into the action, we are not talking about set minding today. On purpose, I didn't make that too clear. Obviously, maybe're in here for for limping in pockets and then flopping a set this is not what i mean with using them as a weapon actually we are talking about more like board misses of of low pocket pairs which is let's say maybe 20 percent of what we are talking about today and the 80 percent are flopping a pair and then using that as a weapon. Like for example, flopping a bottom pair in different kinds of game trees, in different kinds of situations, in different kinds of ranges facing each other. So that's the plan for today because because this is, yeah, kind of a dicey topic, lots of mixing obviously happening. And I want to take a deeper look at why that is the case sometimes, and when we should have a clear preference, when we should go a little crazy with them, when we should maybe not do anything with them, and carry them to showdown in a way. all right so let me just quickly check in who we see here which names i know obviously some lots of french money that's a beautiful name got you obviously in here luke damien has said hey mana great you found your way here jan hey thanks for the help mammoth obviously here a big time champion here all right yeah let's start things. I'll start with an overview of what we're talking about today. And I'll just start with facts. And yeah, I called that someone. Is it someone of you just like writing me like gazillion Skype messages right now? And why is it beeping so much? No freaking groups and something way more. Here we go. go all right so we'll talk about just hard facts what is the case with low pairs what is interesting what can we make use of what are their properties then we'll get to just some examples of spots where we can go aggressive with those we'll talk about in general the when and why going crazy and then talk a little about low peers just like in perspective to your entire range like what does the what's the difference for example playing from under the gun with something like pocket force and fully miss a board or playing let's say just heads up with super wide ranges just like the relative strength relative showdown value and stuff like that and then as always the key takeaway is to to let you go and yeah maybe find some crazy moves or maybe avoid some stupid crazy moves all right cool i'll start with the let's say boring stuff with just facts that that are important when thinking about the topic properties of low peers. And this is what I wrote down. Maybe there's more, maybe you can come up with something. And we start with point number one. It's very, very hard to make. Yeah, hard to make it. There's a word missing. It's hard to make a peer and hold them. So a peer is showdown value in most cases. So we can win with showdown because we have a peer and it's very likely that villain does not have a peer. This is just how No Limit Hold'em works. Everyone who played some heads up with all the shithands knows that if your range is Jax plus, you're fine with peers. But talking about wide ranges, this is just very is just very very important to understand that well a pair is a solid hand and we have showdown value then we have something else i'll call it implied here and depending on whether we talk about a pocket pair or a board pair we have two or five outs to improve and obviously improving is always. Everyone who watched most of the videos or is attending all the coachings, I say stuff like that very, very often that we actually want to look into the future and evaluate how good our outs are as well. It's not about making the best hand, but about making the best hand and having another value bet or even making something nutted another three quarters pot value bet or a three times pot value bet because we have miracles going on and can just rip it in so here we are talking often about the latter right that just rivering a freaking set which is two outs two outs means four percent each street turn river to hit a set very very deceptive everyone who was blasting pocket deuces on ace queen eight five board and river seduce knows what i'm talking about it's not only a great great great feeling but it is something that we can plan ahead because four percent is not nothing right i rather bluff with something that has four percent to make the incredible super nuts that can go for stacks than any kind of i don't know right so five outs obviously when we have a board pair we have two outs to make trips and we have another three outs to make a nice two pair depending on our kicker this can be a very good outs or like okayish outs right to give you an example let's say we have ace five on queen jack five maybe the ace is not that beautiful when all the straights get there that our ace five is not really nutted right but if we have i don't know whatever jack five deuce and then we hit an ace and it's like ace five and three four is not part of the equation uh then obviously it's very very nice so stuff like that um and the best thing is they are very very deceptive right no one will find out that this is a card that improves into lots of sets or lots of two pairs and so on because it's not. It's the rare occasion when that happens and this is what we want to make use of. Okay, now the third one is what we're seeing here. I gotta check that. Loving it, okay. For everyone who's not in the chat, I'll just show that up here and And I don't know how to make that bigger. But that's beautiful. Okay, let's go. I'll use pain to just make it bigger because I don't know better. No clue what was the action, but we got an ace king versus a rubber set of sixes here where I think the money has to go in the middle, no matter what happened before with just like an easy 1 million still in the price pool so someone understood what i'm talking about here love to see it awesome one all right this is what we were talking about it's beautiful and if you just take the same hand and michael was bluffing with a random seven eight of diamonds it's a big difference it's like zero percent to make something beautiful or it's four percent for one street eight percent from flop to river to just like river the freaking nuts okay maybe oh he had the six of spades so the flush was out so very good now the third thing that is just a fact is beautiful blockers that's not true for pocket pairs they can be unblocking something interesting or like have like slight blocking effects. But obviously every board pair blocks villains pairs, sets, and two pairs. So when we talk about bluffing, we're not really talking about blocking bottom pairs, but especially blocking two pairs and blocking the set can be really, really, really strong. I will get a little later to that when we talk about in which situations is that very important and when do we find reasons because of that to go a little crazy and we will find them. All right, so as always, interrupt me for any questions. I have a plan. I have no clue how long that will take. I try to shorten my sessions always because I need at least 75 minutes every single time. But still, I want to give you the room to ask questions if there are any. We have a big variety of players from kind of let's go with some superstars here. We got some superstars here and some actual poker, not beginners, but like low stakes players that do not invest the same same amount of time like full pros and i want to make that enjoyable and not entertaining as well maybe a little but yeah how you call it uh lacking words educational for everyone can you okay what amount big blinds in tournament you have when you stop continuing with low peers so i will focus on the cash games but as any question i'm happy to answer that there's a certain threshold where just rejams get too aggressive so i'm not really opening many pocket peers a lower pocket peers with like 20 big lines and it already starts with 40 30 that this decreases just because it's more likely that people have an ace a king when we are not blocking them and then facing rejams or three bets with those stacks as we can't do a shit can you shortly repeat the blockers part sure if we have a bottom pair it's very very clear that villain very rarely has a bottom set. So let's say let's go with the queen jack five. We have a five then there is one combination of pocket fives out there and not three as usual. So just instead of three combinations of sets this guy only has one combination of that exact bottom set. Obviously when this card plays a role for two pairs as, we can block those as well. If the board is, I don't know, queen, jack, five, and villain would have queen, five, and jack, five suited in their range, and we have the five in the right suit, we can block two of those combinations as well. So just we know because of our hand that villain is less likely to have a very strong hand. All right. So again, happy to answer the questions. Keep them coming in. And let's see. I want to start with examples this time instead of starting with theory. And I wanted to give you the chance for an example. And well, you were fast enough deep into mortar that you already looked into the future and you presented one. But if any one of you have an example, it can just be a hand history. It can be just written out like a spot where you are playing very aggressively with either a pocket pair or a flop bottom pair. Something that pops up in your mind when you heard the topic low pairs as a weapon. What popped up in your mind? Yeah, just I have, I think, four, maybe three, maybe four. And I had a list of more things that I can come up with later. There are plenty of spots that we can use that, like kind of general spots. And here, Damien obviously nails one of my favorite boards that will be a part of the four examples. So he's taking that away from me, but that's a very good one because button versus big line ace king four, we have six four. Beautiful one, right? A board where we discuss very, very often that overbetting makes sense. And here blockers are very, very, very important, right? Villain cannot have ace king, not aces, not kings kings so the only strong hands he's having is pocket force ace four or king four suited and us having a four changes that big time right so we have added full equity maybe we even have a backdoor flush draw i think we only open race that's suited that's six four suited plus hitting a six is a Beautiful card right so a beautiful two pair out as well talking about our five outs if villain is calling with an ace for example so beautiful example maybe another one maybe you can nail all the fours that i present all the four examples i have prepared check race all in loving it here we go mammoth check race all ints' small peer that can't beat a single value bet. So we have a bluff catcher. We are in that bluff catching mode, call, fold, call, fold, and we're indifferent because it's a pure bluff catcher in more passive notes. More passive here standing clearly for villain is not having the nuts. Maybe there are some spots, paired boards, where there are lots of traps and that's not that much of a case that he but he might still be uncapped so usually it's a spot where he's he's kind of capped and we just know his only bet snap call is the river set so just the river bottom here is beautiful but it could be something like ace king four check check turn nine check check river deuce check he bets we can just go all in for example or check raise super super large depending on stack death but just like knowing okay like the only hand that is that is really having an easy decision here is pocket deuces. We can obviously still slow play everything until, until that point. So we can have value bets like that or value raises. And this is just blocking that calling range when it gets like very tight ranges. So loving that. And more personal is like BXB is the blind versus blind or is it button versus i don't know in position versus big blind that sounds good okay deep into mortar going from the next one don't know if a thing but i went with this one small blind flat versus early position open on king three deuce with force check raise versus small c vet asymmetry for the lower sets and four four can get some life equity denied. Yeah, that's a low period check race. Maybe even with a plan, you know you have kind of... if you know your range, if you say your range is like deuces, threes, fours, fives, you need to add bluffs and from a small blind flatting range, it's tough to choose from. You can have obviously an ace-five suited, ace-four suited, something that has like nut outs, something like an ace-something suited with only the backdoor, not the direct gut shot, but something like a pocket pair that can turn something nutted, like hitting a four. I mean, not that great that villain might make a straight on a board like that, but it makes sense. And the other part is obviously denying equity from something like jack-10, queen-jack, queen-10. Or if we look into the future, even get villain to fold better pocket pairs like sixes sevens eights nines tens to fold maybe right now maybe on the turn who knows lookalike river small one pairs like river small set obviously the little hint here with the lookalike principle works there very very well okay cool loving I'll just present mine, and then we'll talk a little more about the theory behind it and why that is the case. Example number one, double barrel. I didn't start with a flop here with 6-4 because that's too easy, so I actually went for the turn. Double barrel the turn after overbetting on ace-king-4. So that's exactly Damien's example. We have versus big line the flop is ace king four we go for an overbet with our four x the turn is the ten of clubs so the straight actually comes in and just look at what our four x are doing okay ace four is unfair that's a two pair king four is another two pair queen four jack four they added a gut shot to their four blocker and but even four five obviously Damien is cool and open raises six four suited as well but the four five loves betting as well just having that four is just very very very strong it makes it tough for villain to defend enough or better saying we if he defends perfectly we still make money because we have that blocker because in this instance us knowing this card makes him overfold even though he isn't. All right or it isn't more than he should as opposed to this is a beautiful board for us. So this is example number one where we can go crazy on the turn. Let's go to example number two. so here example number two is a double barrel on the turn after c-betting small on ace queen eight. This time we are playing I should start with a spot this is confusing how I wrote it down sorry for that so I'll try to explain a little further. We open race under the gun this time and the big blind defense. The board is ace queen eight and we c that small and then the turn is a brick five like brickish five and here we can see that high frequency bets we're having with king eight the flop bottom pair king five the turned pair bottom pair now but even something like sixes and sevens. So what we see here is the king five just a hundred percent like this turn bottom pair like blocker. This is just a two pair blocker here. The king eight, this is another two pair blocker from the flop. It blocks now eight five suited. It blocks still the queen eight that is usually slow playing the flop. It blocks the ace8 that is mainly slow playing the flop. So the 8 is still very important here. While we see there is a flush draw on the board, and the 5x of hearts will call the turn again. So actually we have showdown value with all those hands, even if we get called. And this is maybe a little dicey small difference that makes it way better to bet something like sixes or sevens and not boosts three scores right you see like sixes and sevens they can check back brick rivers and sometimes win the pot against by four of hearts right where we pretty clearly know how villain is playing check calling flop check calling turn check check we win right so something like that small small things understanding those is pretty cool all right so good nice what is jacks two nines doing yeah it's our board probably everyone is not aggressive enough i would say right so yeah it's maybe preparing a beautiful river bluff on straight cards, but yeah, it's a little crazy, but now another point is that, well, I wanted to get to that later, but now it fits perfectly is something that we can think about is how much showdown value are we having, right? So how much more showdown value does something like pocket jacks have versus something like pocket deuces? It's under the gun versus big blind in a cash game. It's not super loose empty T ranges. So under the gun is really, really, really strong here. And I think 8x is only continuing with a flush draw, with a backdoor flush draw. So 8x of of space everything else has a queen or an ace so actually the the showdown value difference of something like jacks and pocket deuces is very very much the same and if we go instead here like this is something interesting that if we go for the check check here instead and we are lucky to get an absolute river break then something like pocket deuces is actually the better bluff catcher than something like king queen than something like like clearly better than something like pocket jacks and so on right so it's just more about the absolute properties than just the hand strength obviously pocket jacks look kind of nice but yeah we see actually which is interesting this is strategy ev strategy and ev shown if you i hope the the quality is good enough that you can read the numbers the number for pocket jacks here is 1.17 the value of pocket deuces is 1.44 it's as like some things it's the better bluff catcher in the check-check scenario. It's maybe even the better bluff now. Pocket deuces will fold out jack 10, jack 9, and so on now. And pocket jacks only block folds, to be honest. Plus, rivering a deuce is way, way, way better than rivering a jack. So this all adds up to deuces being better jacks to nines wins versus five x of hearts yes that's the big it has somewhere shown it wins against eight x of spades and against five x of hearts so pocket deuce will bluff some rivers if they are bluffing now compared to sixes and sevens they will for sure check back just like random guess but would make a lot of sense so just it's it's not just about the absolute hand strength but really what is happening next okay beautiful board uh but not enough time to dive deep into like small boards that's something for good homework just figuring stuff out seeing something oh this is new have a deeper look how to play river what happens if the river is a 10 with those jacks go super crazy every single time or is it is it actually taking the showdown value against the 5x of hearts who knows right or against the 9 10 of hearts who knows all right let's get to the next example example number three i have a three bad pot for you and here we got the a turn double barrel after c betting small on ace king four eight in a three bet pot big blind versus cutoff so what is happening here we three bet big blind versus cutoff with four five suited flop is ace king four we could see that small we could see a little larger here i went for the small c bet with our four four five turn is an absolute brick and four five suited goes for it again 100 again same thing do we have showdown value here like everyone type in yes or no do we have showdown value a value with four five suited on ace king four eight we have a bottom pair one no another no no no no so very clearly right we We don't have show ML. We have a bottom pair. One no, another no. No, no, no. So very clearly, right? We don't have showing value. We have a bottom pair. No. If villain is checking down his queen-jack that he did float before, yes, we might have showing value against the biggest fish in the world, most passive players in the world, but no, we shouldn't be ever winning. We should, like, villain could float pocket deuces and bluff 100 villain should float queen jack suited and bluff at some point okay so yeah even if we do we are getting bluff this is my definition of showdown value only refers to actually seeing the showdown so if we are ahead we get bluff that's for sure which means we have zero showdown value but if we compare all the hands we're having that we could use as a bluff four five is beautiful one blocking two combinations of the three potential ones of set of fours is beautiful then we have the ace of spades and the four of diamonds out there if we have hearts or a plus we even block one ace four suited another hand that is calling down for sure and i can let you know already this will go all the way like 100 on pretty much any river like may is there a flush or no no probably on any river and hitting a four is a beautiful two outer to make the nuts and a five i think is think is good enough to just easily value jam. So we have 10% equity, five outs. Just a little rule of thumb. Outs times two gives you the equity on one street. So five outs means 10% equity to hit it on the next street to make the nuts. Or I'll say to make a hand that can easily value bet for stacks, 400 big blinds. That's pretty strong. Plus having very, very good blocker issues. And yeah, that's it, right? This is why, for example, queen four is slightly worse. Hitting a queen is way worse than hitting a five. Villain improves with ace queen. And yeah, I think this is another beautiful example. We found a three bet pot here and not just random blasting and big advantage single raised pots. I hope I said I have four examples. I hope I have number four. Here we go. I have one more. I wasn't sure. I'm sure I don't have five written down. I have more, but more in my head here, but number four coming. Is it GTO to three bet queen four suited and ace four off, I guess? Big Bambus cutoff range looks a little strange. That's actually, I took that from GTO Wizard Cash. It is because it's taking a very, very large 3-bet size and it's very low frequency. So yes, it seems to be GTO. If you go from like cutoff 2x or 2.2x,'m not sure to 13.5 this is i think maybe a new sizing they introduced if you go to something like 11 which should be more standard right now then you get to see post flop more often which is not good for those hands so yeah it's it's more if you really want to polarize our friends from the tournament world know all the ace four off suits and king five off suits and so on so by sizing up you're jumping a little more into tournament world with a shallower sbr where you polarize a little more ace four off is not low frequency but here in this case it is all right so let's see example. Example number four is actually a check raise this time. I think everyone who watched our coaching for check raising, all the videos about check raising, one of my favorite topics. There I gave you lots of queen five, six examples. Here I changed it to queen jack five. So actually we have a huge disadvantage here. Big blind versus under the gun. This is under the gun sport. Clearly, clearly, clearly. But here against a small c-bet, us having a five, obviously only the suited ones. Well, actually not. Some ace fives check raising as well. Cool. Well, we're check raising just the occasional nine five suited with a backdoor, just an easy 100%. King-5 suited like with the backdoor I guess 75% something like that without the backdoor a little less but still decent. We see some of the 5-4 suited, 5-3 suited, 5-2 suited, 7-5 suited, 6-5 suited. Beautiful right? So just seeing a bottom pair here gives you the allowance to go crazy yes the nine five has dirty two pair outs absolutely but it's the double backdoor straight yeah so it's actually more about the backdoor straights because the two pair is not that great you see that nine five is just even a higher frequency check raise than the than the five three yeah i wondered on the first second as well a little but yeah it is what it is it's not a for for hitting the two pair it's it's just a continuation and then it's you got something going if the turn is a 10 if the turn is a king if the turn is an ace if the turn is a nine and so on because here it's like there are no good cards actually for out of position. It's not like the queen five, six, where we hope for a seven, an eight, a four, a three, and so on. It's like every card is bad and you want to cover those a little, as my understanding of it, because you keep going. You obviously have some 10-8 suited, some 9-8 suited, some 10-9 off and so on. And we are here, this is GTO wizard. I have to admit that that's not a range bet so the smaller bet size means something here we are check raising it's a small bet size actually gto wizard can discount quite some hands because gto wizard is playing a three sizing strategy on that board which no one in the world is playing so maybe actually it's a little overdoing it here against the range bet exactly yeah we want check raise flop with nut potential on the river so here the nine five is not after the two pair too much it's the backdoor straight plus backdoor flush yeah just the nine making back for straight assist maybe slightly slightly better but actually you see it's more the way of playing what i see here is that actually actually the low 5x have more EV than the 9-5, but they have probably better playability on the turn. After check calling and the 9-5, adding some straight draws, then my check call should check fold. It's more a playability thing if I just take a deeper look at it right now. Exactly, Sibarino figured it out at all. I do find I'm just calling flop, check folding turn way too much with these low pairs so this is good stuff absolutely and just think about if you check risk and look into the future and you blast the turn and you jam the river 400 big blind stacks on any run out what is villain calling you down with? Jacks, Queens, Queen, Jack. Cool. But blocking pocket fives here is pretty golden and it's a spot where it's kind of easy to make someone overfold. If you double check GTO Wizards how much they need to defend with the given ranges, there's lots of like King, Queens, Ace, Queens, some frequency. I don't see people calling that down if it's not like calling station recreationals. But yeah, so it's a beautiful spot to actually be a little, put a little of the foot on the gas and go a little crazy. Okay, no more example five, I guess. Okay, so now that's like half an hour in or a a little over that with the examples and some some yeah starting properties and now i try to or want to explain a little little further as always keep questions coming i love it i have a chat on the side here as you can feel and yeah makes it easier to explain the way you guys need it but now i'll just see someone typing so i wait I'll wait a second and drink enough. That's important as well. All right, I keep going and then read the questions. You guys seem to write a lot. Okay, the when and the why of going crazy. It should be a why. No, actually I killed that. Okay, there's no why going on. So I start with the why. Because we love aggression, right? still nowadays games are far away from being over aggressive whenever we watch or see some solver outputs it's like oh how crazy can you go oh how like it's not like how freaking passive like maybe they are passive with non-nutted value hands because then they get bluffed into and blocker stuff and blah blah but on average the solver is always more aggressive than humans are so i want you on average always to get more aggressive in a way that makes sense so this is why the let's call it going crazy while actually we are just learning today that this is not crazy this is just how poker is played in the best way this is the clear why what are some cards that will slow us down barreling bottom pair? Cards that kill our Implieds. If there is a card on the turn that obviously helps Villain's range, then we need to shut down in general. And if we say we check raise a bottom pair, and one part of our value of our EV is hitting trips or hitting two pair. If we don't have implied anymore, really, on like hitting our two pair or our trips that much, then we have to slow down. So if there are straights or flushes coming in, we need to heavily slow down. And even if there is lots of villain, let's say villain hits off to two pairs like the queen jack five ace villain has now ace queen probably ace jack king 10 we absolutely need to slow down because implies are part of the equation exactly the 10 here from hiyachi is the perfect example that's like the master card for the for the ace king right but also the all the freaking two peers play a big role. Okay. So now the when, I explained to you why going crazy because aggression is the key to get better. It's like not clicking buttons, something everyone can do. Check down, check down, see who wins. That's how my local home game was played when I was, I don't know, in seventh grade. And we played for like two euros or i don't know and we played like a cash game sit and go format with 40 big blinds not knowing what we are doing and then all of a sudden you just blast your stack because it's it's late so not not doing anything is what everyone can do but like aggression in the right way using the right knowledge about the cards and again having a bottom pair is big knowledge and the second one we add that later having like more range knowledge that would be the other one is is the key here so now when should we do that we always have the goal of creating a certain pot size this is driven by the outs we are having right how good our outs are. For example, if we have the pocket deuces or where was the example I just pull it out here the pocket sixes. They want to play for all of it and they know it on the flop or for nothing of it, nothing in between. It's like this is what I mean with outs driven. If I make my hand, this is a great idea to have in the question in your head already on the flop. If I hit my freaking six, well, I'm going for stacks here. It's different if you have like, I don't know, maybe a weak two-pair option. Like, you have king-10. What if I hit my 10 here? Oh, I don't know. Like, stacks are a little much. Like, maybe something in between. I don't know. And so on. What about something like ace-7? My hand is what it is. Sure, hitting a 7 is good, but ace-7 right now is something I don't know. So this is something that we should have in our head all the time. The goal of creating a certain pot size. And here we have pretty much, and I'll show in paint now, if I write down paint games there, is actually two options that we are often having. So we have, and I do that in general now, we have a low peer, either board peer or pocket peer, which, and we started with that in most, most examples, has showdown value. Maybe not that much in ace King high three bet pots, maybe not that much under the gun versus big blind, but in most major examples that has showdown value. So if we are talking about our race tracks, directional in. But size flop, right? Doing nothing would just be standing still here on the starting line going all the way, meaning we're going to the finish line here trying to use our stack. Is that often in those low pairs examples, it's something like we are fine here, maybe checking down, winning with a low pair. This is where we try to aim at. Maybe it's even a small bet going in, getting called by like ace highs and so on. Maybe some slightly weaker pairs if we have pocket threes on like, I don't know, ace seven deuce, denying some equity. Let's say in general this area here. Then there is like something we don't want to end up with. This is like dead zone, right? Like this is not cool, like getting two streets in with the bottom here and then check like, okay, it's a bluff that we give up is something else. The other option is very, very often aiming into that direction, right? All the way because this is when we make use of blockers. We know exactly what it is about here. And then our five, for example, blocking a set can be powerful. Blocking two pair. This is where I said the four or five suited, I'm like almost 100% sure in the three bet pot that this will be an all the way block. It has to be better than a queen jack. All right. So this is something where often we can see something or have that image in our mind with a low pair. Do I try to bring it to showdown? How much is my showdown value worth? Or do I make use of it in a crazy way? Actually, I'm just thinking about the example that Mammoth gave us. So it was like, I just make up an example, right? It's like big line versus button, jack, seven, five, rainbow, goes check, check. Then turn is a nine. It goes check, check again. River, deuce, right? So we know after double checking twice, we have all the advantages in in the world sometimes we can try to go for a check raise we have six eight we have ten eight and after villain checking back we know he doesn't have those hands river deuce best hand he can have is the freaking pocket deuces we check villain bets 75 percent pot we jam right we would be happy with the check check. This is why we check, we jam, I don't know, a random deuce-axe. We are fine with check check. We stay in that area. Villain decides to go, let's say, green for villain here. Villain tries to move into exactly just out of our comfort zone. And then we say, no, we don't want to end up here. We could fold. Then we obviously stay at this as well. We're not investing any further money. Or we say, now you know what? I'm fine actually going here. And then he's fucked again. It makes a credible hero call or not. We don't care if we build solid ranges. Obviously, lookalike principle, we could do the same with pocket deuces. I play pocket deuces 100 deuces like 100 like that like lookalike principle to be honest right it's like why why shouldn't i i check every deuce on the river because i've shown value against all ace highs and my pocket deuces are just like playing deuce x two times and then after him betting and he can never have a better hand than there is one sizing i don't care too much about the the stack death then. So yeah, good luck calling. Okay, let's see. Does anyone know what happened on the flop and turn with this hand? This hand I was writing down? No, probably not. Oh, I forgot. Maybe. So sorry. If it's important, just ask again. Against aggressive opponents, usually... The Adamo hand. Oh yeah, I don't know, unfortunately. Against aggressive opponents opponents usually keeping it small to show it on it's not really an option so craziness it is fire with fire or fire with water right over fold flop to just continue strong it's the other option I don't want to say like we always need to go crazy versus craziness but it can be very very effective if you do it in the better way then this is is the max EB for sure. Cool. Let's look it up. Let's look it up. Whether all in is the thing. We have the GTO wizard open. Yeah, not a, that's a little hidden brag. Nothing to see here. Just like working on it for the coaching a little. And here we have the button raise, big blind call. We have, what did I say? Jack, seven, five. Let's add a freaking flush draw. We have the check, check here. Turn was a nine. Oh, let's get my face out of here. You don't need it for now. Check. So we see pocket deuces. We checked again. Villain is checking back now. So let's double check on that for a second because that is important. How much 10-8 is villain checking back? Actually, in GTO Wizard, he's checking back like 5%, just to prevent something like that. In-game, we are freaking sure that he has 0, 0, 0, 0% of that. He's not checking back 10-8 here, right? This is why we can go crazier than than GTO Wizard is going here. Now big blind again, deuce on the river. Oh, what is all the deuce-ex doing? This is a two-peer, that doesn't count. Another two-peer is playing like five-ex and deuce-ex. And pocket deuces are just checking all the time. And yeah, so this is what we do. And now let's Let's double check. let's double check i said villain is betting 75 which is his major bet size just having one bad size there in that game tree on the river six percent all in pocket deuces max ev let's freaking rip it what are the other hands we are ripping three deuce 100, 100%, four deuce, 100%, king deuce, queen deuce, ace deuce, partly. All right. Oh, I love it. Okay, cool. That feels good. Okay, let's jump back into high stakes. Now that feels good. Beautiful example. And I hope this is understandable what I mean with the two circles here that we try to aim for something and make sense of our range. Okay. Very cool. Okay. That was the answer or the example for goal of creating a certain pot size. This is something you can very, very, very often have. And the low pair, especially bottom pair as like trips outs to pair outs, or talking about the pocket peer set outs, put us into the all in direction in most cases, if there is not the flush and so on, or in a very, very, very, very, very tiny pot size. Yeah. So this is something very important to me. And then the second is the, the, the, when, or like coming to the, when a little, we want to go when, first, showdown value is not the driving force of our EV. Remember the 4.5 suited in a three-bed pot. It was not about the four. It doesn't have to have much showdown value. If we talk about like a pocket peer on Ace-Queen-8, that example, Ace-Queen-8-5, we have seen the double barrel with King-8, with King-5, with actually pocket jacks, jacks pocket tens and pocket nines which still seems kind of ridiculous to me but it's i love it right if we really think about yes we have a tiny fraction of showdown value against some pier plus flush draws but maybe our overall range is just so good that we should keep the foot on the gas right so don't over evaluate your showdown value of those lower lowish middleish peers in a strong range of spot. Strong in that moment means that we come from under the gun, this is why villain continues tight. This is it. Or if we were playing three bad pot under the gun versus MP then we are obviously like a low pair. Yes, we beat ace-king on the non-ace-king high boards, but that's about it. Then the second when is in spots where blockers matter a lot. I think I said it already, but I'll give back that question to you guys. When do blockers matter a lot or when do blockers matter the most? Can you answer that to me? When do blockers matter a lot? Here we go. You can get my face back if you want. Easy question, easy answer, deep into more narrow ranges. The tighter the ranges, the more influence we can have with our blockers. If there is a range that is like about 500 combos and we are sitting there with our, I don't know, what do I have to like this here? Our cards, one card, let's find another card, two same size cards, two same size cards, we got those here, two cards. So like yeah, I block three of your important hands of your 500 combination range. Yes, this is like people talking about blockers on the flop, like button versus big blind. It's yes, maybe slightly, maybe, probably more likely that you just like look at one side of the blocker thing and not at the other side, like unblocking. You block value, but maybe bluffs or like folds at the same time. Who knows? But if we talk about knowing two cards in a range where it's about maybe 20 combos well this can be massive right so just like calling down a three bet pot where you know exactly his range that he calls down a set and those two pairs and he has those this is the spot or that we check raise that bet and we know exactly which hands he is not fast playing before, which hands he's just calling down with. But he does that 100%. Well, that's beautiful, right? So this is something we need to keep an eye on. So we want to use that bottom pair blocker when it comes to tight ranges. The tighter, the better. Don't use a bottom pair just because it's beautiful not to go crazy in the wrong spots. Just like, yeah, I randomly raise here because I block a set. Does it really matter in that spot? Does he maybe play that differently before? Who knows? So really very tight range of spots. And this is why we go, like the pocket deuces, we go for all of it. This is where the deuce matters the most. We know a villain has the lucky one combination of pocket deuces in that spot, or he hates his freaking life. All right, backdoor flushes if we have the ace. That's it, that's the same thing, right? Narrow ranges, flushes, it is about the flush. We block 10 of those, so that's good, right? We block 10 snap calls that we otherwise do not block. That's exactly the same thing, right? It is about the flushes there. It's easy to find the correct blocker with the flushes. Everyone sees those. All right. Then another thing is when do we want to go crazy with that, with, with like low pairs or even the pocket pairs is when we lack other bluffs. This is not the range understanding when we lack other bluffs, so we either started with a tight range or our range improves big time. Flop, turn, like a great flop, great turn, maybe even a great river. And it's very tough for us to find bluffs. Then we even need to take those from like usually out of position. The big one we call it like turning peer peer into a bluff but we can do that as the aggressor as well like something that maybe see by the flop plans to check back the turn but we improve on the turn and now it's like we don't know what else to bluff if all our draws get there make better peers and so on then we just fill that up with some bullshit hands like pocket deuces pocket threesrees, pocket fours, which, and we've learned that already, it's not a bullshit hand because they have two outs to make the freaking nuts on the river. So this is something beautiful. And now this is something I want to do another little paint game. Let's see here. To showcase what is in my head in those situations is, yeah, is first think asking yourself which better bluffs do you have and how much showdown value do you actually have right showdown value changes with every card we see and our potential bluffs is something which that changes every every time we see a new card so i actually kill that here and we do something like that. Let's say we have all spots. They might change from flop to river depending on the board changes, but we have value bets. Talk more about being the aggressor, right? We have our value bets. And mainly we have, let's not talk about the flop too much because often we bet just like for several reasons, for range advantage and so on to just build a pot let's talk about the turn when we're like the point where we usually polarize which is very very often the turn polarizing means you're using bigger bet sizes this is the moment where we can talk about either having value or bluffs let's represent the value bets with that circle and very often it that is like this, that we have this year, like way more hands than that, that I want to call like all potential, potential bluffs. We could bluff all of them. Some are great. Like for example, draws. But to put those together, I don't want to call it draws. Let's say something like, say like strong draws maybe here. That are very, very strong draws, natural bluffs. Like I have a flush draw, I have a straight draw. And it's like, cool, right? Everyone sees that. This is what everyone finds. Then we have hands that I just put them in here for potential bluffs. Obviously they're not really a potential bluff for most of us. And this looks like a baseball now. Okay. Say like, showdown value hands. We have a mid pair. A mid pair is also a potential bluff. Cool. Sure. Yeah. Cool. So, showdown value hands. Obviously, we are mainly, after range winning, we check back a mid pair or a weak top pair or whatever, right? Pocket tens and five but in theory that's potential bluffs we could bluff them as well and try to get villain off better hands and then we have lots of stuff in between let's say what we have in between is like weak draws low showdown value like for example a bottom peer that has some showdown value but great blocker issues as well block blocker properties what about all the gut shots idiot gut shot what about just some like an overcard like a king high ace high this is all in here but sometimes it doesn't look like that or like let's say this is those hands starting on the flop and sometimes everything gets there right like something shifts and then this year is all value now and all those improve to like solid show on value hands like this year not value but this is show on value hands now and then there's not much left and then we need to take our shit and bluff it yeah idiot gut shot like a-8 on like a queen jack something. Idiot end of the straight. Idiot got shot. So, isn't that a common term? I thought so. Okay, then that happens and then we need to make sure to still find bluffs. Usually this is the spots that people usually overfold to because it's tough to find the bluffs. This is the spot where you need to turn your your pairs into a bluff. So maybe we can come up with a spot. Let's start with a tight range to make it easy for us to just hit something. So under the gun versus big blind. Let's start with something like the queen. Jack-5 was our example for the check raising. In position is doing well obviously. We can bet a lot. Let's take what's the highest frequency bet size. This one actually is... that's a bit big. Cool. Villeneuve calls this time and the turn is what should be the best card in the deck for us now where it's really tough for us to find bluffs. So looking for a quick answer. It's not meant to be a tough question. Not sure whether it's the EV wise best card for us but the one where it's tough to find bluffs. Come on, who is there for me? The 10? The 10 is a great card but I don't think so. It's very easy to find suited aces as bluffs. So I go with an offsuit ace ace of clubs ace of spades it's very tough not to find bluffs from under the gun but obviously villain improves to straights as well and it's maybe not evy is the best card but it's very tough for us to find bluffs and it will be easy to find value bets right so villain checks and yeah we have our value bets we're not going crazy with the sizing because villain can have it as well but what are our bluffs right we have like maybe 10 9 we find some of the king 9 king 8 king 7 sure those are maybe our natural bluffs but then we need to add those deuces 3's 4's 4 5's still going for it 9's 8's yes sure right so yeah I mean king 5 here go. It's like the 5 is bullshit. Bullshit shoulder value. No, it's not there. Villain won't check down something worse. What happens if it's check-check and the river of cards? Give us the 7 of diamonds. Is Villain checking down a 5? I'm not seeing one. I mean, I guess the big bet he's not continuing too many 5-backs. 9-5 of hearts is over, but bluffing. We're not like if one checks to us, how often are we winning with king 5? Never. So this is showdown value. If it goes check down what is your showdown value, you see the number here with the king 5 of hearts. It's a zero. Okay. So this is what I mean with that. And then it's very, very cool in our potential bluffsuffs because no show and value means not giving up on anything. Okay, cool. This is how I see that a little the value bets potential bluffs sometimes that shifts in size, right? So it's like you've got a bigger or a smaller kinder surprise there and then you need some more or less surprising bluffs. The example with the king five, we were talking about being under the gun. We were just c-betting. We were c-betting this. This time we were under the gun. Sorry, I should have made that more clear. We were c-betting flop and then we were betting the turn again. I was talking about the turn betting. All right. So if it's a little fast, I'm trying to rush through a little. then this will be on the platform for sure. Just stop it there. I think everything I said was rather clear, just very, very fast. So you can go in slow motion there a little. And yeah, it's actually tough to be very precise there and be fast at the same time. Okay. And then the last thing that I wanted to show you to train something like that. So now we figured out which better blocks we have and the showdown value. I tried to show that there as well, all together, just like what is our showdown value? Often we can guess. GTO wizard can help us to just actually show a number. The number zero is pretty clear. And then one more thing I can show you that just helps a lot. And this is why I was not showing off with my GTO wizard before, because actually I cheated because this is just showing you the results more or less for the trainer, right? Because this year, I don't know whether you guys know this, the GTO with hand classes analysis. This is what I tried out there in that drill you have seen there. Is it this one? Did I close it? Yeah, unfortunately. Drainer, this is here. This one here. Because I was trying the hand classes analysis on the side that just tells you pretty much to do with which hands. But it's not about doing an awesome GTO wizard score. If you want to know why I don't think highly of that score, check out the GTO Wizard series on the platform. I'm more looking at the best and correct and EV loss, which was zero. But that was easy because I had the correct answer on the side. But I still want to show that to you because it's awesome for learning purposes. So let's continue the session. Actually, this drill here is all kinds of spots in the cash game world combined. Not great for learning a certain spot, but here for, I just get the picture out of the way. Here we, for example, I'll play blind versus blind out of position. And what you can do is just look here. You can, I just, for those that work with that is where are the continue session here. You can hear the display. You can show that, show hand class strategy, and you can just see what you do with certain hand classes. So here, for example, how often I'm not looking at my hand. I'm not trying to play that correctly. This was what I was interested in, right? How often am I actually betting bottom pairs? Sometimes it's very often, sometimes not. Here, it's very clear because the betting doesn't make too much sense with most of our eight acts because we are playing blind versus blind, incredibly wide ranges, which means an eight has solid showdown value. All right. So that 10, nine, I don't give a shit. It's a trade off board. I'm checking this time and I'm just quickly playing that. I think I'm betting now. A random size. He calls. And now that sucks, but I might be betting 10. Is that something? Maybe. Fuck. Okay. No bluffing. I tried to move him off exactly something like that or an eight, but the eight is actually my 10 high is playing fine. So that was a blow up here. Okay. So now no, I'm not at the aggressor. So I quickly need to play that one. Maybe a solid check raise on the flop as well to get around that spot now. First plunder. Yeah, here we go. So maybe dunking now, who knows? Right. I'm just checking. Yeah, maybe dunking. All right. So now button versus kind of after flatting now. So we have seen a flat here. Low pairs refers to like fives, fours, threes, deuces, I think. No, under pairs. And under pair means under the high card. So low pair should be fives, fours, threes, deuces, and the six X, which we see, okay, it's an okay board for us and so on but you get the point all right then we can just play around with that maybe just it's always better to focus on one spot like three bad pots like button versus cutoff like button versus big blind and so on that you can just see how often should we do something like under pair is like mixed jacks is an underpair so i can bet small or check it will be both fine this is this is kind of how i cheated there in the first place small bet underpair is sometimes raising jacks is the best underpair so it will be sometimes raising yeah and now underpairs are folding or calling right so we know that's like whatever right fuck you all right cool any questions regarding that? Then let me know. If not, that was the one before the key takeaway slide. And I hope you enjoyed that one and have a good idea how to train that a little. Exactly, right? Just deep into more, as he says, just like clicking that through gives you very, very good vibes to have a feeling. All right, and then you can, if something is like, oh, that seems different to what I thought. Then you can look it up in detail. All right. So coming to the key takeaways, low peers often have two options. The showdown value versus VAML. I named it without knowing a mammoth, the great example. This is actually my favorite example for now. The deuce X on the river where we've seen the hundred big one chick jam after checking down before because that's that's like show numbers value versus vamo we try to get a deuce to showdown or tell him to off that's that's our strategy and this is like those words are perfectly represented with the with the gto wizard tool okay the blockers get powerful and tight ranges you have narrow ranges before it's just an example. If we know two cards that have an influence on 20 combos, it's worth a lot compared to two cards trying to have an influence on 500 combos. The tighter the range is, the more we know how Willem plays those hands exactly, the more we can evaluate how good our blockers are, then that gets powerful and then often the bottom pair can be very very sweet blocker already on the turn polarizing for example like this under the gun versus big blind example something like that blocking for example villain check raises something on the flop but this time he just check calls and then blocking the potential turn two pair it's a low card can be very very beautiful if that does not really have showdown value, often like ace high, king high boards. The third thing here, don't overvalue your showdown value in tight ranges. Lots of people check because they have a pair, but in lots of spots, a pair has zero showdown value if there were bets going on in the middle before when ranges tighten up. So this is important. This obviously needs some experience to evaluate that somewhat correctly, and I could still work every day on that. Okay, and then let's call that the Adamo theorem with that beautiful hand here. This is what I mean by that. Focus on the max positive outcome when it comes to implies. Focus on what if I hit my six? What if I hit my six? It the check down hit a six get one street in it's the i blast i hit my six i got the stack in this just tells you what your hand is made for yes maybe for 90 92 this hand is made for check down not hitting anything but for eight percent it's made to win a stack going from the flop okay so this is a great mindset to have and actually down not hitting anything but for eight percent it's made to win a stack going from the flop okay so this is a great mindset to have and actually one of the first homeworks that i give private students or did when i was doing that a little more is just to write down what is your hand worth on the flop what's the draw you are having right here pocket sixes is the third pair right now and a two outer to a hand that is ready to stack off plus a backdoor flush draw then maybe something like queen jack is a nut gut shot to play for stacks or it's a six outer to turn a third pair that is fine winning something after checking down or just naming the things what are you trying to achieve and that in the end helps you a lot to i'll show that one more time or actually i need to redo it not like this you know which oh no this is here we go to help you a little just naming where you try to get to right seer or is it like you're drawing to a low flush that maybe doesn't want to play for stacks and you hate it to get check jammed on the river but if you make a flush you want to get three streets which i would represent like something in that area here right not all the way but like quite a good good good like quite some money going in the middle that's something like that and just this is a big helper and they're understanding low pairs with their properties of the blockers and the implied you have with the two pair and trips outs is pretty cool as well as the, the missed pocket peers, right. That's still an 8% create a freaking set on Turner or river. All right. Just 10 minutes over the time today. So I'm doing great. Thanks for everyone who was here. I hope you enjoyed that. And yeah, see you in Discord. I'll be around a little more the next month, I'm pretty sure. And yeah, good luck going a little crazy, but not too crazy with your low peers. Share those hands, please, in the cash game or for the tournament, guys. Feel free to link me in the tournament hand histories if you check jam pocket deuces on a deuce river or just a deuce even cooler all right have a great day guys
