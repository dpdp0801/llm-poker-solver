### TOPIC: cash low stake exploits
 Let's get started. Topic today, low stakes exploits. I know a lot about exploiting, even though people think I'm a GTO, whatever, but I'm not. I can play like a monkey on drugs, as I always say. And this is what we try to do whenever we have reads, but we need to get those. Yeah. What can you expect from today? I'll talk about the connection between a mistake and an exploit. Then I'll let you brainstorm a little, and then we'll split it up a little into pre-flop, post-flop, actually into pre-flop, flop, turn and river to maybe come together. Like I prepared some, let's say, natural exploits or natural mistakes that people are doing and how to exploit them the best that I will just present. But I'm happy to put in as much of stuff that comes from your side that I've overseen in my preparations. As always, closing it out with some key takeaways to let you guys play and crush. After that, yeah, let's start with the first one. Mistake exploit. I mean, I cannot hold that session here without starting with this slide here, right? So it's my three questions. The start, hopefully of everyone who was browsing through the platform, all the videos there, right? My general concepts, starting with this one. Three questions I ask myself in every single poker spot. And why do I put that here? SLE says a mistake would be an error in play and an exploit would be a frequent mistake in play that you can use to your advantage. That's not really correct. Like the exploit is not the mistake. It's like deviating from GTO. It's like, I don't want to call it mistake when you make money, right? So it's like making use of someone else's mistake. Now, this is why I present those three questions here again. For me, it's like one step, two step, third step. And exploit is the third step, which is the last on that little three question letter here. And I just can't start with it. I cannot talk about anything when I just start about talking about exploits. So actually what we need to do is really, we need to know somewhat, at least what would be right in a certain spot. We have GGO wizard. I have it here on that second screen. You have it somewhere. You have it in my videos. You have my thoughts in my videos. Anything. We can discuss that, right? It does not need to be a solver copy, but just discussing what is right. Maybe knowing that's slightly better than your opponents. We need that to figure out the next step. The next step is what is villain doing wrong? And here it's like exclamation mark and caps lock mistake. We want to spot mistakes because this is what we need. If there is no mistake that we spot in our world, villain is playing perfectly. If villain is playing perfectly, we cannot exploit. So if we don't know what is right to then spot a mistake, there is no way of exploiting. It's just impossible. In private coachings, or maybe in some of the videos I already told that little story that I overheard, like the first time I was in Vegas. And then someone was just like starting those explanations with exploits. He was just like, I mean, not really. He was talking about a mistake as well. He was like, I'm check-raising light here because he's over c-betting. It was a story I overheard. It was like someone talking to his buddy. And then I called the board. We're like, the board was King 10 deuce rainbow. And he went for a super random check raise because villain is oversea betting. Like, okay, someone is wrong here, right? We're talking about a board, given stack size and everything else, whatever. Villain is allowed to see that his entire range. So how can he be oversea betting, right? So it's like, he just was searching for an exploit, or he was just like not right. And he was in the end doing a mistake, right? So here, we want to know somewhat better what is correct than villain to spot his mistake. And once we have a mistake, then we can think about exploiting. I phrased it that way, what is the right exploit, which I actually don't like anymore, right? So that's a tough question, but maybe someone has an idea. Why do I not like the wording of question number three? What is the right exploit? And I want to change like just a little something. What is the right adjustment? I mean, that's the same thing for me here. Here we go. Jerome and Patience, please do it better. They crush it. What are the right exploits? Because here it kind of triggers that there's only one exploit which is not right but in most cases if we're talking about river and villain is over bluffing yes we call all bluff catchers okay that's probably what we do maybe raise a little more as well who knows depending on the spot but if we are like having a large game tree ahead of us there's usually more than one exploit and like all the theory topics, when we talk about one spot, I tried in the examples to give a couple of those. So if maybe you remember some of those and yeah, what are the right exploits to give me the option that there are multiple. All right. So this is something I want to keep in mind. Three steps. I will repeat that probably 10 times this coaching. We need to know what is somewhat right or have an idea at least to spot a mistake. If there is no mistake, there is no exploit. Like if someone is telling you he's playing exploitative poker, he's telling you at the same time that he needs to understand poker first to spot those mistakes. If he's just not knowing that, then he's playing guessing poker, right? This is what like lots of people who call themselves exploitative players, like actually they are guessing players, which is something else. I don't know. I'm not believing too much into gut feeling stuff, especially in online poker, but yeah, maybe. All right, let's keep going. And now I prepared that slide for you and I'll call it just brainstorm. I just put on some words for you to help a little, to not start with a blank sheet, but actually I want you to just put in your top three, top five, top one, low stakes exploits. What are you doing every single day play? Can be higher stakes exploits as well, right? Every single day, one exploit that you make money with, right, just can be one, two, three, can be just one, can be just one can be five can be short can be long just shoot so i want to know the exploit try to make a full sentence because here like park a wall i don't know whether you are referring to other people oversee betting when you just do something against them where you do oversee betting i want to know your exploit like just to be sure if parker i guess you mean you like to oversee that that you just say like i oversee that but that's enough actually all right you do it over three betting the big blind versus late positions boom open more on the button than gto against nits loving it sit down with 60 vpip guy is that exploiting exploiting is on. This is game selection. Yeah, kind of. You're exploiting that as well. The more checks I see from villain in a line, the more I bluff him. Okay. Overfold versus face-up villain. I would need a definition of face-up villain, but I know what you mean. Loving it. Overfolding in general for Jason Scott. Overfolding to four bets. Even you see like here in a a little extra most people at low stakes aren't for that bluffing giving the explanation as well poker bro just going with the overfold overfold in spots i think they don't bluff enough correct i oversee that on the flop small as they do not check raise enough and most of the time overfold word specific overfold to three bets cheating with my sizes all sizes. All right. You take my wording there, cheating, like bigger when we have it, smaller when we don't have it, usually. Overbluff versus passive lines goes hand in hand with the more checks we see. I think it was from Jerome. Yeah. Betting when checked to twice, usually weak. All right. So now I hope you find lots of things that other people now named that you actually do as well. So now what I want to do is I want, like some of you have done it already, but for me, it's like that awareness, like the more awareness you're having when playing, when exploiting, the more correct your exploits will be when you have a reason for things. So now what I will do is just, I read through everything again and give you the connection between the mistake that we exploit and the exploit itself. I asked you for the exploit, but from now on, we will always take those together. Here's a mistake. We want to exploit it. Oversee betting. The mistake is villain is probably not check-ising enough, or he is over-folding. Two options, two potential mistakes that we fight with over c-betting. We could think ahead already, right? We want to do that maybe with which hand categories, putting out too many c-bets, having good equity realization. On the other hand, if someone, for example, is just not check-raising enough, we might even want to size up with certain hands, right? Already thinking about multiple exploits. Patience, please, or going for over three bet in the big blind versus late positions. Saying nothing else, but late positions are either too loose or in the end they overfold versus our three bets. Another reason could be that they call often but overfold to post flop, but that would be like a multiple line exploit. So here, I guess they are overfolding versus three bets. And I think that's true. Open more on the button than GTO against NITS. What's villain's mistakes? Mistakes is overfolding, not three betting enough. So we make more money. Perfect. I'll skip the Hiyatsu sit down with 60 BP IP guy. Everyone knows what that is about, right? Playing a fish. You under bluff. I would say maybe in certain spots when people have it and their mistake is calling their bluff catchers too often, right? They call their bluff catchers too often. This is why we skip our bluffs. Maybe we are not bluffing at all. Would be the, I call it the maximum exploit, right? Can't do no wrong if there are two 60 BP IP guys at the table. That's correct. That's a beautiful table. The more checks I see from villain in line, the more I bluff it. What could that mean? What are we exploiting? The mistake is either they're probably not overflowing their catchers there. No, they construct their ranges in a wrong way that they end up with two weak ranges in that delayed game tree, I would say. Right. Which leads to overfolding, right? If they are not bluffing enough before, all their air is in their checking range, and this is what we attack in the end, right? So the more bluff heavy we want to be in the end, maybe bluffing everything. Overfold versus face-up villain, just believing people, right? They are not adding bluffs, so we can easily fold our bluff catchers. Easy. Next, overfolding. Overfold to four bets. People, let's say, forget their four bet bluffs. I'm not going into detail right now, but that's like button versus big blind, ace, jack, off is maybe a high frequency four bet. People are calling. So yeah, there are no four bet bluffs. Easy, right? So we just call what is profitable against value. And this is probably not pocket sixes or the king 10 suited. Overfold again, oversee bet the flop here's a full explanation already from just so tool cheating with my sizes versus players who do not check race enough perfect with that already over bluff versus passive lines we had that already betting when checked twice usually weak we had that already didn't value the river player as player call to light on the river perfect people call too call to light. We don't only stop bluffing, but we go thinner for value. Very, very good thing, right? People are calling too often when they have a bluff catcher. Does not only mean that we are not only bluffing. We could size up with value. We can go thinner for value. We can size up with strong value and go thinner with weaker value. We are not bluffing at all. Maybe like two, three exploits at the same time for one mistake. Low stakes players do not respond well to aggression. Absolutely. Right. When they show you they're weak, kind of face up players back to that. Right. We can't. They bet small. They have a strong hand. They bet big and so on. We can tackle that. Use weird position sizing of villains to make a better decision about their range and make a better decision. Just weird positions. I don't understand it. Same size betting with aces or just where they don't four bet bluff enough. And I realized equity, not balancing checkness. All right. You see, like, it's kind of a circle. We're riding some rounds there. Same stuff coming over, over and over again. Right. So Yachir has a very good point. Today is about low stakes exploits. So it's like a little about more population tendency to just say like, this is what people are in general doing wrong. The more specific you can get and really exploit players, that's perfect, right? Just really what he says, understanding the logic behind players, right? Is he just hoping to hit and it's like his joy coming from making a hand or is he trying to bully you around and his joy comes from like bluffing bullshit and you fold but understanding that those incentives helps you a lot understand a player and then really outplay him which is obviously tougher when you just jump into let's say the zoom and a five pool all right let's go to the little list i started for preflop i want to split it up a little all right don't play zoom that's a very good, it's not an exploit, but it's a very good guideline. But some people are just playing for fun and have like one hour in the evening. Then maybe it's a cool thing to get some hands in. Yeah. For making money, don't play Zoom. I try to be a little more specific. All right, let's get to pre-flop. This is what I came up with in the first 30 seconds. And I have a little exercise for you. So we'll we'll start with all of them. A couple of them you mentioned already. What I see on low stakes is low three betting in general, all positions. I see face up calling ranges. What I mean with that is like someone flats cutoff versus early position. I see bigger than average open race sizings. I'm talking about live games here as well. Like people like 4Xing, 5xing, 10xing, something like that. And I see people being too loose and positional unaware, right? Lots of players who just, they play King-10 off-suit, which is not wrong in the first place. But if there's like an under the gun open race and you're in the cutoff, it's really not a good idea to do that. Lipping, I did. Great. We got the next one. Limp-ping. Okay. So now the headline of those things is mistakes. And now your exercise is tell me the exploit slash exploits, plural, right? First little exercise for you guys. We started with the first, right? We just started with low three betting. People are three betting, low frequency. What is or are our potential exploits? If villain is actually reacting and is in exploiting mode, and maybe he's doing that against some players, but not against us, then it's actually dangerous, right? But now I'm saying this for low stakes, where maybe we don't see the same players over and over again, this is just what people do. And I don't expect them to be somewhat pros or have that train of thought to just say like okay i'm doing this because of that and so on they play what they look at their hand and they make a decision right that this is kind of i see it as a given thing you're thinking on like an n100 plus level right so yeah when we see the same players over and over again i have my sheet for 5k plus for players i see every day then this is more on a player level right here's like really we sit down and have like an unknown guy sitting there with 70 big blinds and need to have some expectations okay so now we see a couple of things we see more open racing right let's have that explanation why that is correct obviously that is correct just go i open gto wizard here we look at the button open raising strategy let's's stick to the 2.5 sizing. Let's say given small blind strategy being that here and big blind strategy being that, which is 14% three bet from the big blind, 14% three bet from the small blind. If we know that people are not like, are three betting way less than that, what does that mean? If we look at our weakest hands, we should be open raising. Let's take 10-8 offsuit. That means that a higher frequency, we see a flop and we will win back a share of what is in the middle there in the pot. So our EV here is zero, but because of our read, because of that mistake that people are doing, it has to go up, right? So definitely all the hands that would be raised false to a three bet, they go up in value at the same time that is important to understand slightly as well is if villain would play perfectly post-flop value of aces goes down right we get three bet less maybe no bluffs where we make lots of money with our aces right that goes down but yeah we can widen and to a certain extent right so i always have an image in my mind where i talk i think about offsuit side a lot and talk about pips, right? Where like I go one pip wider, which would mean I know that king eight is the line. Then I go king seven and queen eight and jack eight and then like seven, eight, something like that. That I feel like maybe I go three pips wider. There are spots where I go any two, right? So really we now know an exploit and now we need to decide to which extent we want to go. Okay. So now which other one did we have? I start here. Open more, opening wider, overfold to three bet. So first we have something before people even get to make their mistake, we already exploit them. We open wider because they three bet less. Now the three bet happens. Exploit number two, we obviously overfold, right? So if big blind 3-bets, and we know this is how his 3-betting range should look like, we know that he has like only 6% 3-bet. If he does that, what will happen? He will have on average way stronger hands. And our ace jack, which wins 2 cents or like 2 cents of a big blind, will be minus EV for sure, right? King 9 suited, jack nine suited minus cv 10-8 suited minus cv king queen offsuit for sure minus cv on the other hand which as someone mentioned maybe the pocket pairs play better and instead of minus 0.06 the pocket threes get plus cv because on average they try to reset and get full payoff when a villain has aces and kings all the time so that's maybe maybe better than running into certain bluffs. Perfect. Exploit number two is overfolding. Exploit number three is, let's see what was next. Overfold to three, folding more to three. Forbid for value. Very, very, very important. We are not trapping against someone who has it. Why should we? All right. So let's see. What do we see here? Aces is a 40% trap with that rate structure and stacks us. Hell no, are we trapping aces. Why should we? All right, so let's see. What do we see here? Aces is a 40% trap with that rate structure and stack size. Hell no, are we trapping aces. Why should we, right? If he misses all the bluffs. And we obviously forebet because he won't find 40% folds. All the hands that fold to my forebet, he doesn't have. So in the end, he will just always keep playing. I had spots where I'm just jamming aces because I know they have kings or queens. Just decreasing the risk of a certain board where I don't stack them anymore. And I make sure I get the 100 big blinds in the middle being a huge favorite. So now we got open raising wider. This was before the villain's potential mistake happens. Then we have the overfold. Then we have the fast play, both when the three bet happened. All right, let's see whether we find more. Widen the opening chip. Four bet bluff less. Obviously, that kind of value fast, we are not bluffing at all, right? That's kind of, I stick that to that. Obviously, that's a thing. Sizing up with strong hands. I love it that Poker Bro found that one. No one forces us on very, very weak tables to only use one size. If they are not reacting to that, I'm min-raising my shit and I'm making it like 10x with my aces. They are never three betting. I play some games where people are flatting queens in the big blind. They flat like no matter what my hand is. Like, and they are never three betting. It's tough if I min-raise to get 100 bigs in the middle with aces on some boards. Like it's really, really tough or we don't want anymore because there are way more better hands or something like ace king right we just go bigger if like they are like really talking about lower stakes where people are not on like an educated poker level right they look down at their hand they like it or they don't so that's maybe a good idea and this is something we almost never think about so this is six by number four if i don't add theadding. You see, we get a good list here, and it seems like after pre-flop, the hour is over anyways, but okay. We find some more. Forbad the stone nuts to the max, call more with pocket pairs from Jerome. Perfect, like, changing calling range. We had that. Bluff catch less. Pulse flop. I just call that adjusting to that range, pulse flop. So obviously we don't need to bluff catch when there is like when their range is jacks plus and ace king and there's a king high board like are they bluffing with jacks now like i'm exaggerating a little bit you know what i mean and obviously how can you estimate the pips that you go wider i know somewhat the stats that people should have and then like go a little i mean if you don't have any stats yeah i mean i always go on those things just way wider just because i go for the post flop edge reason but i mean i don't want to it's not arrogant if i do it but it's like if we say like okay we're playing in a five ourselves and we try to get better every day it would be arrogant to just say like i'm way wider because of post-pop edge and then like maybe step by step right if you know like okay he's just slightly too's just slightly too tight, we go one pip. If he's like playing 5% of his hands, we go any two. And then there are lots of steps in between. This is more, I think, experience. And I don't have a formula which is correct, right? Because there's always post-flop. All right, cool. I like that a lot. We got four, maybe even five, depends on how we split it up. Multiple exploits. Let's go for the second one. This will be a quick one. Face-up calling ranges. How do we exploit face up calling ranges? Really talking about the spot we open raise under the gun, cut off flats. Analogico, completely clueless size manipulation, see that small, they fold too much. Right? So there is actually, I mean, it's not a trap question, but it's tough. Here. Be range ever. I think you mean mean be range aware, right? And really say like, okay, cut off flats. I put them on sixes, sevens, eights, nines, and eights queen offsuit. That's kind of it. But we need that understanding that we had that before and what that means for the ranges, because here the exploit is only taking place post-flop. I've seen squeeze before, right? If people are not protected at all, they are maybe protected by the open raiser. That can be a thing, right? If we are behind them in a position, but being the open raiser, it's just about post-flop. We can exploit that knowing that they don't have certain hands in their three betting range and that they do have like certain hands proportionally often when they're flat, right? So really that we say like, okay, we have aces on 5, 6, 7. Again, I'm exaggerating, but we can check fold in this exact spot. Even if he's betting pocket 8s, then this is their bluff. If, I don't know, we are deep and they 3-bet and the board is 6, 7, 8, we can go freaking crazy. They are not protected here, right? If they are not mixing at all. And there are some players like live, they look down at pocket eights. What do they do? Call. Pocket sevens? Call. Pocket queens? Three bet. Right? So these are not ranges. Like this is really like a bunch of hands and we can know what they have. And same thing, we can attack that to the maximum. We know their hand or their hand category. Board is ace, king, deuce. I bet 10%, 15%. Like really fuck them up. Or I induce something. Who knows? I know you have, like, they have nothing. Maybe they have, there's some ace queen that I just talked about. Besides that, they have five, six, sevens, eights. So really adjusting from going super crazy, investing lots of money on boards they don't hit to like not investing anything on boards they massively hit. So really you've got to adjust a lot here, but it's post-flop. So it's a tough one. All right. Now, next one. I see lots of big open rate sizings. Now I've been to Vegas. There was even a tournament where someone was like 10x open raising. What is our exploit? Laugh is a very good exploit. Yes. Okay. So here we see very different things. Call less, 3-bet more. Call and evaluate what? Parker Wall just gives us the explanation. More dead money, so 3-betting more. I always wonder about sizing though. So what is the thing here? Well, if someone 10-axis and you have aces, what do you want to do? You want to 3-bet. You want to get more money in the middle. If someone 10-axis and you have pocket eights, what do you want to do? You don't know because it's like bad price for calling, like three bet, whatever. So we don't know the frequency yet. I mean, if they play a reasonable frequency for their sizing, they are playing like 3% of the hands. So we should find that out. So if we ever see like them open raising King Jack off like that, well, then they're way too wide. And that's the point, right? There's just more debt money out there to be picked up. Like against some players, I play a three bet only there. I play a tight range. Like it's a very bad price. So I'm only sometimes interested in that pot. But if I'm interested, I will pick that three bet button because I don't want to be that guy that has aces in his three bet range and calls pocket eights and nines. Like obviously we can do that if they are super dog shit post flop. But still, I prefer that way to have full equity on my side always and keep my range together. So more debt money means more incentive to be three betting. It doesn't mean that we are wider. It's just we narrow our defending range. It's a bad price, but of that tiny defending range, we can split it up into call and three bet. And I do it like that. Three bet and zero call or like close to zero, maybe something. Exactly. Yeah, true. But like, that's a theoretical thing. We know 10x, we don't know frequencies. So there's no exploit yet, right? If he does that with Kings Plus, it's somewhat fine. But my additional info was mainly in a live game and no one is playing Kings Plus in a live game only. So people sit there bored. So we find that out very, very quickly. If we see him do that like the third time in an hour, that's good enough. So we defend way, way, way less, but off the hands we defend, we go bigger. Obviously, if he has five different open race sizes and 10X is his Kings Plus range, then we can't do anything about it, right? I'm just saying there is like a middle old man sitting there and for him 5x 10x is his standard open race size because he plays that in his home game which is fine if everyone does that in their home game it's kind of the standard this exists especially in all those live us games but we want to exploit that right if you have a home game like that right with some american friends out there stop calling your king 10 off suit just stop it right don't even call your king queen off suit exactly like we see it like three four times that's good enough you don't get dealt like king's aces that often darone i'm not three bet bluffing no i play linear range every hand i want to play like cutoff versus hijack i play three bet only anyways like maybe not in a live game where i play just way more hands but if someone someone opens bigger than 3x, I'm for sure going three bet only. And then I play my eights plus, ace jack plus range. He's probably the guy calling king jack, king 10. Let's stick to 5x, right? 10x is really, really extreme. But I think like in a 5-10 game, people open raising to 50 is something we see all over the planet. All right. So loose and positional unaware. I'll just fast forward a little. It's just like those type of players that just like King 10, call it in the small bind, call it in the cutoff, whatever against the 5X open raise. Well, what we can do against them is just open raise bigger ourselves and squeezing the shit out of them. Right? So this is just a very easy one. Against limping, there are two things. Two different players. One player type is limping only, which I see it more as like a very cheap open race. He's saying like, I see it as a first interest in the pot. And then I play like an over-calling range because of the good price and like a three betting range, right? If his range is not capped, he just limps every hand he wants to play, then it's not the worst strategy, right? There are some spots in high stakes games where it's correct to just limp under the gun, for example. Then there are other players who limp weak and race good. That's where we really want to punish every single limp. We can play with threshold. Maybe they are still calling their shit against a 3X or 4X ISO, but they are folding versus like a 7x, 8x ISO, then we can play around with them. Knowledge is key here. So it's really, we are caught in reaction game. What is their limping range and how will they react to anything? Exactly. Limping is not the main issue, splitting is. What is the problem with limping is the free play that the big blind gets, right? So if we are in the big blind, we just smile and be happy about our free play and can like represent all kinds of stuff on all kinds of boards but like in button cutoff hijack we don't gain ev through that if villain just plays limp only okay to have some more time for post-flop as well i'll push a little forward i'll give you that slide here again mistakes lead to exploits low three betting higher rfi bigger sizings with strong hands we even got to different exploits different type of calling range fast playing value never bluffing lots of things phase up calling ranges that just make it super simple we change our post swap game on certain boards depending on how they hit big open race sizings lead to our plan of defending tight right and then aggressive when we defend we want to attack the dead money. Lose and position unaware. Actually, we want to play tight and raise bigger, right? We are not winning money if they are calling their king-10 offsuit words wrong and we start raising all the 8-6 suiteds, right? It's an equity game. King-10 off has very good equity against 8-6 suited. Obviously, post-flop exploits and so on, we can calculate that in, but just open raising our better hands like 5-x and then calling king 10 off suit is very, very good. But then I still prefer to min-raise my 6-8 suited on the button. We can be loose and maybe go bigger with something like stronger. Okay, so let's go to post-flop and let's play the same game kind of. Let's start with the first round first round of things again you can add that you do every single day mistakes you see every single day this time we start with the mistakes not the exploits so i start with c-bet sizing means hand strength people betting strong hands bigger we can smaller check back means face up hand never checking checking back something strong, mainly like mid pair and stuff. And people now out of position, not check raising enough. That's like my typical, or for blind versus blind, I can say raising as well. I can add that. Mistakes that you see every day that I might've overseen for now. Donking while range disadvantage. Timing tell, yes, that's too tough. tough for me to put into that session today because I just don't have any reads on timing tells of those guys. Usually it's a little face up or no decision and so on. Not aware of range interaction. Yeah, auto CVAT. That's good, right? Mistakes over CVATing, I just call it, right just over c-betting on unfavorable boards perfect okay like just having that auto c-bet button on even though the board is like 764 i like it all right cool then let's go to the exploits and yeah let's start with the first one c-bet sizing means hand strength this is the easy one over cold two big bets easy some more for the first one. Raise higher frequency versus small bets, right? This can be plus, plus thinner value. Both of that, right? Again, smaller bets, we can go thinner for value. We can put more pressure on them playing for stacks, playing graphically. Perfect. I think this is it, right? Raise smaller as well. Wow. Wow. Oh, this is great. Raise smaller versus small sizing to improve your risk reward, right? Okay, let's go to the second one. I like that a lot. That's already a lot, right? This is really, if you think about it, so many things we've tried to exploit just because of one mistake. Check back means face up hand. My example would be the check back king, queen, deuce means they have a weak queen or they have pocket jacks so here we go over bluff versus their weak range i add if they fold all right this is a very big info i didn't give this info to you it often means that they have like medium showdown value some people just call it down they check back the weakest top here they just click the call button i like to test it out with this year first it's not an overplay but you know what i mean overplay thin value right he checks back king queen five i take king eight plus and go not for stacks 400 bigs but like for 150 150 see is he calling down his queen is he calling down his king deuce is he calling down i. So really, I know I attack a medium strong range. I go as thin, as big as possible for value. Exactly. People check back pocket kings on A side board, but it's still kings. They don't fold. Slow play more with strong hands if they fold. Oh, if they fold. Okay. Actually, like it's again, two things. First, their range is a certain thing that we need to adjust to. And then there's correct sizings and correct strategy in a balanced way. This is the one thing. If we have further info, how they react with their kind of range, which is just like a couple of hands, well, then we can even bluff huge and bet like smaller for thin value to make them call. But that's a tough information to have we know some player types right that they always call turn they always fold river can't be one right where they're mid pairs it's like sometimes call both okay that would hurt or they just like call a small sizing on the river but if we really go like 150 percent turn like 200 percent river they will end up folding so depends all right. Jerome has a very good thing, right? More careful if second pierce on the turn and facing a bet. King, queen, deuce, turn queen. We need to freaking check range. He always has that freaking queen. We know more. It's like the face up range where I wanted to check fold aces on five, six, seven. We know you just have infinite trips or the king, queen, deuce, turn jack. Oh, you have three combinations of pocket jacks in a very very very tiny check back range you just make lots of sets and maybe queen jack two pair and maybe even ace 10 who knows might be in there really very very good card even greater than it's shown in gto wizard already so let's double check on that example i mean king queen deuce is maybe not the best example and gto wizard is not the best one because it mixes so much on the flop that we don't see like a range bet here we see like actually not too much betting and lots of big sizing but lots of players do bet that full range with a small sizing and what i mean with people face up is that they check those hands all the time that are 100 check like jack like jacks, maybe 10s, maybe weak queen. They do that every single time. And the ones that are mixes, they actually prefer betting because it's easier. Like I can see people betting king, eight, 100%. Have you seen ever someone check back ace, king here? I didn't. So stuff like that, that just because they try to follow maybe even GTO wizard, but just because of the mixing, they mess it up. And then usually I don't want to say that their range is weaker because I think people are c-betting 8-5 suited 100% of the time as well. So it's not weaker, their check-back range, but just more centered towards a couple of combinations, which means if the term check-check is a freaking five, they don't have it and we can go crazy. Let's see how crazy you're overbet 9.2%. I like to go way more. It's like king, queen, king, jack, king, ten, king, nine, all of those. Freaking 100%. Fuck it, right? If the turn is a, I mean, the jack will be bad anyways. But in my theory here, it's even, even worse. This always smashes somehow. Wouldn't it be huge sign to attack this mid-condense range? Every hand in that range becomes a bluffer. Absolutely. Yes, this is what I want to do. Like here, we've seen the 250% in theory, right? And in reality, it's even better. Okay. Not raising, check raising enough. I think I can just link you to save some time to the coaching about check raising, because there I talk all the potential exploits because they are listed even five of them for people that are not check raising enough what do we do quick words to the donking while range disadvantage maybe I'll ask that donking while range disadvantage how do we exploit that yeah sure is with me here that's actually scary he says seems strong says the drill Other guys want to raise a lot. Do we want to raise against a strong range? Tough. Proceed carefully. So one part wants to raise, so one part wants to not do anything. Depends on sizing, absolutely. What it means usually is it's not the natural thing to do. So something triggered them to put out a bet on that board. And the only thing that can trigger them is actually their hand. So what it means is they have some kind of connection to that board. So their betting range now is obviously stronger than a checking range, which means we need to slow down slightly. And if we do something, we usually want to size up because we are attacking a medium strong part more than nothing part if they have nothing they check so now maybe i put out some words you have some more ideas where to exploit that so usually not not it but medium that's my read as well but connectivity to the board here we go chevy i like it their checking range gets weaker i often encounter players who are very weak in those spots i see people people with gut shots, with a weak top pair, with a mid pair a lot. Like raising once usually is not enough, but going all the way can be great. But the very, very, very clear point here is showing that their checking range is weaker. If we know someone is a donker, we can even use smaller c-bet sizes if they check and like go a little more after them. Okay, over c- will be very very easy with building good check raising ranges and all their c-bets will just be bad so just playing correctly with c-bets and maybe even a little more aggressive is the key here okay now i will just present my thoughts for those things i presented a little less chat but i enjoyed that a lot it's always worth taking the time but let's go to the turn then, where again, I put on the first three things that came to mind. So the first thing is bet size means hand strength. That is always a thing. People look down at their hand and want to achieve something. So this can mean multiple things. If on a board where, for example, in theory, they should only overbet. Say someone here c-bets half pot, call, turns the five of spades, check, and now in position instead of overbetting, bets half pot again. It doesn't exist here, so we're in the dark streets of the solver world. I could ask now, but I won't, it takes too much time, is that I put them at hands. They have exactly the hand usually that is just slightly too weak for the overbet let's double check again what should overbet check over bet here right it's like king 10 king 9 is the line so they don't want to check back such a strong hand so they bet this year and then usually that is king 9 so this is the point where i start raising for value with all my king jacks it's not in the solve here because still here this sizing doesn't get taken but it's still balanced in this zero percent world of gto wizard so if we are reality don't just have freaking king nine here right i'm going for stacks and then he sits there and it's like i induced i what can you rep like whatever like i want so many freaking stacks and then just showing some heart and jamming your king jack you know you're good thoughts like that understanding now first it's coming back to the three questions what would be right understanding that this is an overbet spot like would help to know that villain does overbet sometimes and knows that and then really going for it understanding the mistake they are doing and then going for the max exploit so this is one of my absolute favorite exploits coolers like king jack versus king nine where you should win like 20 big minds winning a full stack all right second one only bluff draws there are some people who only bluff draws very very easy let's say they see that turn is this year they bluff their jack 10 that's too tough they bluff some ace jack ace 10 they have 10 9 let's say there's a flush draw on the turn they have their flush draws yeah but this type of player has trouble finding bluffs on other boards let's change the spot slightly under the gun big blind calls king eight deuce check high frequency c-bet 100 is a very high frequency big blind check calls turn is another deuce all right so big blind checking range again what is villain bluffing now right his bluffs should be still some four five suited some queen nine suited some queen jack suited some queen jack off suit i expected some jack 10 as well but it's not really in the under the gun range those a size is five is four is three there are some people who just don't find those bluffs because it's not absolute first level bluffing ace ten some people are never bluffing ace ten they check here right because they put us on a king they put us on an eight why should they fold and so and so on that's a typical thing i'm seeing where like the easiest exploit in the world is just to overfold obviously he actually obviously it would be a mistake to shove king jack against someone with one size on turn absolutely stepper dave talking about that's what i love mainly to go for thin value i'm not bluffing that spot too much to be honest all right no check raise bluffs again same thing allows us to realize more equity and we can bet more equity hands than we are supposed to understanding and mistake people are doing coming up with the beneficial part of our range and know how we can play that okay let's get to the river the river. Very, very easy. Some people call bluff catchers too often. Lots of players on low stakes. They are scared of getting bluffed. Some people do never bluff raise. They are not betting thinly for value and some people are not turning pairs into a bluff. So let's actually stick to this board here because it's a perfect example. These are the first ones I came up with. This board. Let's say this time we bet on the turn. Big. Villain calls. What does villain have? The typical low stakes villain has obviously a king and nothing else, maybe an eight, but he always has medium showdown value. If the river is a break, I want to go as thin as possible for value and as big as possible for value because this is the thing, right? They sit on many a size not any busted draws no they sit on a freaking king if we overbet here this is their reaction that is forced right which is theoretically correct they need to fold all their king x and this is kind of exactly what i expect people not to do right potentially they're raising all that on the turn they have it. They're never check jamming like an eight on the river, this type of player. Like the typical passive low stake player making a hand, calling down. I might see myself jamming instead of that 150% over bet, expecting them to always call king, queen. So it's a different thing if there's a flush draw on the turn, right? Then they have like pair plus flush draw, then Then they have ace high flush draw. They have some folds. We could bluff at this spot. I'm bluffing 0% against that player type I'm talking about right now. Very, very clear and going for the thinnest of all values with the biggest of all sizes. That's the plan. People that never bluff raise. What is the exploit there? Obviously, folding when they raise, but that allows us to bet more thinly for value. We only need to have 50% against their calling range. If they do bluff raise, say like a flush board, I change it slightly here to have some more hands I can choose from. King-10-deuce, there is the deuce of hearts. Then we have four of clubs, right? So king-10-deuce for the flush draw gets there. Sorry's like a big big big crying in the background that's kind of distracting so we bet obviously not over bet on the turn we bet normal call river is the three of clubs i said and now it's like close right he has flushes it's one of those spots where we can't even value bet pocket kings not pocket aces with ace of hearts it's like we are down flushes. Like actually we see that it's all in or check. They're not really like thin value bets, but hell against a passive player who's never checked jamming for sure I'm betting pocket tens. So here let's say we bet this amount. The problem here is that in theory villain has ace queen, which I would win against and he checked jams now and I lose against that hand, which is a big downside if I had the option to check back. But this is something if people are not bluff raising, we can value bet more thinly. Okay. Actually, since I need to wrap it up here, I will make the add-ons parts about that and talk a little more. So I'll put down the add-ons to not rush through the last stuff. I think that makes it a little better for you guys. Yeah, so I'll just get to the key takeaways and talk about the river a little more. Coming back to the general idea of the whole concept is we need to spot a mistake. Absolutely. We need to spot a mistake. If not, we cannot exploit. To spot a mistake, we need poker foundations. One mistake can lead to several potential exploits, right? Not taking it as a given thing, right? Really thinking about it. What does it mean for our range, for future gameplay, unlike different parts of the game tree? That can help a lot. And then there are, let's say, natural mistakes that less experienced players are doing. And we can expect that against anyone, right? People not value betting thinly enough with block bets, for example. Maybe check hauling that instead. Maybe to find the value raises on the flop, but not the correct bluff raises, right? It's easy for everyone to check raise with a set. It's tough to take your bottom pair with back or something. So this is just the case, but think of the three-step system. What is correct? What is villain doing wrong? What is your exploit? If you can answer for yourself those three questions, it doesn't have to be perfect. You're making money and you know where it's coming from. All right, I'll prepare some add-ons to give a little more insights on the Charn River that I needed to rush through a little. Have a good one and see you for the next one, guys.
