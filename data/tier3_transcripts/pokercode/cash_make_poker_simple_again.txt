### TOPIC: cash make poker simple again
 Welcome to the free coaching. I'm in charge today and we'll talk not only cash game but poker in general. Actually like preparing coaching is really tough I have no clue how long it will last but I need to wrap it up for the home game start. What's up guys? Hi Vamonet, hi Gardino, hey Secondhand, Nighter, Highlander, HighskilledHeadsUpHunter, wow these are crazy names. Guys, hello InspiringPoker here for the win. We'll talk about talk about solvers we'll talk about not solvers we'll look at some results i'll pull out paint as almost always i think one of the fan favorite programs here on my computer mammoth the great great to have tournament donks in here as well we're not talking necessarily about cash games examples will be cash game ranges but whether that makes sense with those or not, actually this is what we will be talking about as well. So nice, welcome NL10 shitwreck, perfect. This is just for you, this coaching, I think. And actually everything we talk about is what I execute on a little higher stakes than NL10 as well. Feel free to drop any questions. Usually I'm streaming with like a little delay to not show my old cards and be safe of that but actually it feels great to stream live. Gives me actually a little energy to just really see what you're writing in time and be able to answer to it. Hey Bex, hey Nipa, all right see you Rodrigo, buy the title. I know we will be talking about splitting our flop range between eight sizes. I only solved it for five my sir but you're on the right track and we will talk about why this is shit or why not. So yeah, many new members here. That's nice. So let's go. Everyone is welcome here. So maybe potential new members, maybe just here to have some free input. That's great as well. And actually, I think five past four, time to start. Why not? So for those who are not Poker poker code members already you should know that my coachings usually are a little different because i usually don't start with talking about poker but have some weird examples that only in the end make sense and i found one for today as well we are still talking about poker today but this won't be the start yeah i'll show you first what i have planned for you today and then we'll jump right into it. Like Messi as a goalie. Yeah, we're coming back to football today. Not Messi though. So yeah, make poker simple again. I think someone wrote it. I just talked about it in the chat already. This is what we are talking about today. What does it actually mean? What do I mean with making poker simple and why do I say actually again is poker tough these days? Is it tough to learn? Is it not? We'll talk about my opinion on preflop about charts when they make sense when not. How should we treat them? When should we use them? When don't they make any sense? Why am I for example you can guess already why am I not giving out any charts even not for the poker code members not for free not for the members because I think actually little hint I don't think it's really good for starters to have like clear charts to follow for multiple reasons is this going to be on youtube I think not I think you can see it for a couple of days now on twitch maybe we cut out some highlights I never know that's not my business I'm just here for the coaching but yeah let's see it will will be on the poker platform for sure though later the next thing we'll talk about post-lock. We'll talk about simplification Simplification is the absolute key in my very personal opinion for me It was kind of a journey starting with poker in like 2010 11 12 We start very simple went to see that only see that size was like 2 3rd caught because like why like why should we go smaller we need to attack a flush draw whatever then everything got more and more complex and actually now what i do and other people are doing in high stakes as well as really going to that simple poker back again to make sure hey we want to be good we'll have a look at depending on the time so i can stretch it out there a little and i have plenty of examples or i rush through a little let's see how fast we are plenty of examples different spots to really showcase what i mean with that how you can put that into work how it can help your poker game why it does make sense to follow certain things you see when it does not make sense to follow certain things you see and actually why you should always try to be the boss of your very own poker business on the second screen i have the chat here i will always keep a little eye on that as well so feel free to drop questions i might see them or not so sorry if i don't see them but yeah so vitrix just in time here we go all right let's get started i didn't prepare questions really today usually we have those little kahoot quizzes as well, but since they can only be for like 30 people, it doesn't make sense here for the free coaching, but I still want you to think about stuff and maybe feel free to drop your answers in the chat if I see them or not. Doesn't matter. Just like it helps yourself. Yeah, let's start with one thing and we start with what does it mean? And you can give it a guess. I gave you like two teams. We see on the left side actually the starting 11 of Real Madrid's Champions League final this year. I don't think personally they were the best club. I still went for the winner to just not be biased and present them in the ways like they were the best club last year maybe even in champions league and on the right side you see the starting 11 of the last match versus nidabull donau from my hometown team fc gensbach and maybe yeah give it a little guess how can that relate to poker what is the difference between those teams like really name it Try to name it even if it seems like the most stupid question of all times. And try to give it a guess. Because this is really leading us to the problem we are seeing and experiencing these days in poker. And it should help us in the end to really understand the big picture. And like make conclusions of that. I'm just reading here a little. We need some answers. High stakes versus micros. Individual skill experience time invested. Right. Very good stuff. I want to read that out again loud from PitP00700. So like I call him like PitBond now. Individual skill experience time invested. Right. On the left side, obviously, they are very, very strong players. On the right side, I can give you a hint, it's not the highest league and those guys are really like okay. It's like shit. Quality of players. One team has better players on every single position. We are talking about position, right? Interesting. Known versus unknown? Well, depends on which circles you are talking about. They are very known in Gernsbach, obviously. Better coaching, better preparation. Okay, okay you nailed it you don't need the next slide i still put it in here we're talking about the second lowest league in germany they finished just 13th in the table with like 16 clubs in there so not getting relegated into the lowest league with like yes six wins in 30 matches and like goals they made 29 goals and they conceded 98. Bad rail versus good rail. The rail might be a little better actually at the FC Gansberg than at Madrid but yeah this is just a personal opinion. I mean now maybe you can tell me a little how do you think this relates to poker and why is that the case? Like how can it help us? Like how does that relate relate to poker like who do you identify yourself with maybe a little more i'm part of the team still kind of so i think it's like since i'm talking about kind of us it's okay to call them shit rex versus recreationals actually not at all no not rex versus recreationals if i'm a professional poker player actually i don't consider myself like real madrid not at all actually what i think is gensbach in this case like is every one of us we are learning and we are far away from being good and real madrid in this case here will be the solvers we are looking at but actually in poker it's the case that the solvers and the machines and like everything they are just way stronger actually these days than the strongest humans this is just a matter of fact of like how things develop that might have been different five years ago but what we are doing is and what actually lots of low level clubs do as well is they try to copy something from the top level but we try to copy the perfect solver we try to copy the system of Real Madrid but this depends on the players as well right let's have a look who is playing their midfield Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, Kazemiro like they are just like not losing a single ball like on the right side I can give you some insights right this Marco Merkel guy like he has the worst right foot you have ever seen and he's right footed right so this guy is running a marathon that's great right he's running non-stop but like andy yeah usually playing like actually the second team like he's more like drinking the wheat beer afterwards like not really into it christian hermann has like two little kids he has to take care of so actually he usually goes to like the pitch and is like done before the game starts his brother florian right now is just building like a house and is like busy all day there and busy with like three jobs to actually cover the expenses for that house well i never made it to the team and on the left side they are all individuals and like very very strong actually for the positions the right team actually doesn't even have a striker because this guy turned 36 and finally retired at the end of the season. So it's like fucked up, right? And this is what we're trying to do. Why should that team on the right side think about yeah, let's play with like four people there in defense instead of like three or five. Let's play with like three people on the sixth like defensive midfield or like someone is the eighth like more offensive. Do this that have like two fast people on the outside one striker and so on like copying that doesn't make any sense why not take the strength of like those individual players if there are any or just choose a system to cover the weaknesses maybe as well right so game selection right actually this fits as well right so actually this is now where i see how it relates to poker because if you think about how are most people studying these days they are trying to copy the very very very very very best which is the solver actually right now right we had it as the start of the session actually someone writing in the chat we'll see boards with like eight different sizes right now and it's great like if if you want to split into like three, four sizings on the flop and you say like this is what the solver does, this might be fine but it's actually like not achievable to play correctly after that. You just totally mess up. The first thing we need to do is accepting this. Accepting that we are shit compared to to the solve maybe even compared to the best players some more or some less right it's like but against like the the solution we are all and we are in this boat together and it's like the question okay how can we build things that we actually as like being humans execute that as good as possible what is our personal system how can we still be successful how can we actually be better than others so I'm just taking some time reading the questions here the most important fact to me is there are only 10 players in the right team I didn't even spot that but probably I cut out the goal no there's the, actually. 10 players. Yeah, that's really bad. Good spot, Mark. And also their opposition will have bigger mistakes. They should think how to exploit the other teams in the league. Absolutely. The worst thing I always thought of, we had that one striker who obviously wanted to take the penalties. I was always convinced I would take the penalties way better. I think he had like a success rate of like 60 to 70 percent but he was like the kind of cool striker who was like yeah the guy who makes like 30 goals a season apparently not this season though and it's like yeah this time maybe chip it in the middle maybe top right whereas like not a single goalie knows where you're shooting like no one is filming like why not take one spot where you just go every single time and you practice this, like, three times after training? Like, I can tell you, I missed one penalty in my career. I took some. We're like, I can tell you, I'm taking my right foot and go in the, like, left corner, whatever. Like, kind of strong. Even if those goalies go there, they usually don't have it if I don't mess up. it's like I think like my rate should be more in the high 80s but whatever right so it's like something like that you need to beat those other suckers and how do we achieve that even better find your passion give it your full focus never have kids or get married well not really right but I get the point theoretically if we use one bet size we need to build bigger checking range no that's not necessarily true actually that's wrong but it helps us what would be right is it helps us to keep the game tree clean and know exactly what we have on turns splitting into five things you are lost on the turn i would be lost on the turn i cannot even give you a coaching for that i can understand things the solver does if i look at it but like no way i'm doing that just became a dad actually no not yet but like could happen any moment okay right so this is what i mean with that i talked about it already a lot it's just for me understanding what a solver shows us a solver actually shows us the EV of every single hand and of every action that we take if we play perfectly like the solver on every future street and if villain plays perfectly on every future street versus your exact strategy as well. Actually, as I said, we are sitting all together in this one boat and we are all shit together compared to the solver, not compared to the other players. We can easily beat them if we make great game selection, if we are just better than them, that helps obviously. But compared to the solver, we are all shit. So we can say the first bullet point here, we are messing up all the time and we need to be aware of that. aware of that the more complicated we make things the more we will mess up later and at the same time well we know that villain will mess up as well whatever we choose it's like okay it's tough to really design stuff and pretend that villain like plays better or worse against certain strategies we can have ideas but the full focus should actually be on us right how can we build a game tree that makes sense that we can actually execute instead of saying i've seen real madrid play and now i try to play the same like them it doesn't make any sense right we are different and we need to accept that and this is kind of a new thing in poker and this is what I mean with it got kind of complex. We can see all that but it's just 100% not realistic that we execute that. So actually I'm always surprised what is the next slide as well. I have no clue so let's see. Cool. Let's start with preflop. That makes a lot of sense. Attack where a villain likely messing up, hide our own mess up That's a good idea. But why not fixing it? Why not making stuff easier to not mess up like in the first place? I think it's possible or to mess up less at least So preflop for me means really here. There is lots of decisions to take on further streets We talked about we need to play perfectly on all streets since we are preflop there are still lots of streets to come lots of decisions to take on further streets. We talked about we need to play perfectly on all streets. Since we are pre-flop, there are still lots of streets to come. Lots of room for messing up. Actually, I think there are not many people using three different open race sizes. And this is for a reason. Even the sims you are running for pre-flop solutions, you're not playing around with four sizings. If we go a little deeper there, in the poker world, in solver world this would be a thing definitely why should we like raise every hand 2.5x or so so that means we know we will mess up and villain will mess up so i could show you all charts in this world and it will show like this is a mix it's zero ev and people talk about that this is hand is zero ev but this hand is nothing right if you're better than villain and he messes up more every hand gets easily plus ev in the first place if villain is just better tighter you are missing some t's here yeah i'm messing up here okay so sorry for that i was just doing that on the go this obviously means the weaker you are the tighter your ranges should be the better you are the loser your ranges should be right I'm messing up here a little so don't get confused. So the weaker you are The tighter ranges you should start with probably the hands that are shown in a solver world It's like it's okay to open raise that you make like one cent or something, right? Maybe just leave that give up on that EV because it makes your game tree way easier All right, just maybe start under the gun with 6s+. Why not? Suited connectors and go with ace-jack+, king-queen+. Makes it way easier to not mess up later. But be aware of what you're doing. So actually we could do that, right? Right now, where I say like always, this is what you can do. Talk about pre-flop break, we could do that. We can solve everything for different pre-flop break. it changes everything but just slightly in a way and it still doesn't take into account that we mess up let's google no limit hold'em six max range we'll get to some competitors of us and i don't care i googled that already yesterday to try right upswing poker poker strategy whatever you can take this as a beginner under the gun okay, okay, this is German. Sorry for that. Under the gun preflop ranges. Actually, this is not German. Lecture. Open raising range. Take it. I think this one is good. I can show you another one. I think this is a good range. You can take it, right? Maybe let's take the one I use here for under the gun. We can take this one. Actually, it doesn't look too different. It's slightly looser here, like on the offsuit side taking the peers here with some frequency these connectors like those instead of having 100 just mixing all of those actually okay maybe not having the suited aces but why not they are just making little ev right so it's like if you are not better than your opponent's post block and you are just learning the game why not start with something strong like the chart is not saying that you make this ev it's saying if perfect versus perfect plays then you need to play those hands so this is something where awareness is the key awareness of being shit pretty much never do big bluffs at micro stakes that bluffs per se in like a theory world are most of the time zero ev in like other great blocker scenarios that can be different we don't want to leave those away usually but absolutely you don't need that yeah this is my take on charts just really focusing on those two points that the solver is not thinking about doesn't need to think because the solver is always playing perfect and the villain solver is playing perfectly as well So here we want to focus way more on who sucks who not I had yesterday a spot in the session Where I had someone who's just way too loose preflop and just like keeps calling like he flats jack-10 off suited small blind versus early position He then calls a squeeze. So obviously there was someone a good player open raising from under the gun This weak player in the small blind did flat and I was sitting in the big blind. We're like what is my squeezing range now? How wide do I go? I just do that obviously because of that small blind. I decided to go with king jack plus offsuit which is obviously ridiculously way too loose but it's like how tough is it for under the gun to react to that? he cannot know he doesn't know what i'm starting to build here i'm just going for max value against that guy so it's like if you look up and just play your chart here what is the squeeze in those spots solver versus solver versus solving you know that the small one is just very shit and you are just shit you want to just play lots of hands against him give yourself a chance to stack him or the other way around if i'm on the button and there's linus love in the big blind why should i take like a zero ev mixing hand i know i will mess up post flop more than him so it doesn't make sense it will for me personally it will be minus ev to open race so accepting that is very important all right so let's go from there i you three different charts. This here is the solve charts I'm having for Zoom 500 with stars, rake structure. And the solver chart for the button open raising looks like the following here. Like ace-2s, ace-3, off-knot, but then all the offsuit aces. Like the line of offsuit 8x is kind of the ones we mix. And then we have like those suited orders. Where like for me, if there is linus in the big blind i'm opening something like that like just accepting i'm rather giving up here and not mess up later with my very weak hands give like tiny tiny solver ev up but then play better or versus weak opponents obviously i'm just like adjusting like and i'm not talking about them over folding or do anything just like weak in general a little weaker post flop than me so something that is slightly not okay in the solver world will snap go plus cv so i want to get you to start thinking more pre-flop again it's so easy to read off charts right so maybe some people i have one printed out as well maybe have this here right this is a different rake structure some people have this but it's it's like a good starting point maybe right you have like an idea to learn like something okay but if you're a little further in that career i want you to think more pre-flop way more those two points who is messing up more where is my v coming from we can actually pretend i like that marking everyone as a fish including ourselves because we are all bad so where is the money coming from there right and where should I stay a little tighter where can I go a little looser and maybe we can take those charts as a starting point somewhere but if you ask me for charts I'll ask you to pull out google take that under the gun chart know what you are playing or take the other one compare three that you find find. They will be somewhat similar, maybe some adjustments, but that's it. There's lines on the big line, I might be at the wrong table, yeah, or he's busto, but now I'm a little confused. Fedor said in one YouTube video that you can be one combo off but not two or three, but that can only be true if we take a chart as true. Probably maybe explaining that to all our friends that coming over from the tournament world in different spots the future game is way less way way way way way less and we are talking about potential flop turn river mistakes here 100 big blinds deep i'm playing deep stack poker here and messing up river situations we are not talking about 0.00 something an EV, we are talking about like X amount of big blinds. If we are talking about 10 BB open jamming, then there are no future mistakes. Then we need to nail this. This is the end of the game tree. This is the end of this decision. This is the same like having a river value bet or not. Like 100 big blinds in a 3-bet pot for stacks. We don't mess up that, right? So this is something that you need to work on. 10 big blinds, tournament, game is over after that. 20 big blind rejamming, game is over after that. But here starting the whole game tree deep stacked is a very very different thing. I hope that answers your question second hand. It's really that how much future game there is. If I play short stack, 20 big blinds, totally different thing. But welcome to the cash game world. We have deep stacks to play with behind playing live with 300 big blinds, even more, right? Maybe you guys watch some cash game streams as well. Player who I think is doing a great job there is Gareth Edelstein. Actually, he defends the straddle with any two. He's usually in those very soft stream games. He's playing the best player. Why shouldn't he defend 7 deuce off with the best odds of the world? He's like 500 big lines deep against absolute monster whales from his perspective. Yeah, he has lots of room to make up for that small theory mistake. With like just playing better later. Our assumption is 100 BB cash gap. Yeah. All right. I hope that got clear already. And I was super happy. I'm i'm actually following pat's all the pat stories these days since he did that with scoop and vegas and like very very active on instagram and he had like a massive rant about like people talking about charts like i love that so much because it's 100 my opinion and he was like freaking people discussing whether they defend queen on off and it's like minus 0.01 or like queen 8 is the line or queen 10 or whatever it's all bullshit and then they all mess up post flop we're like what are you guys talking about even right there's still room if this guy sucks you can defend way wider than that if he's incredibly strong just throw it away and this is definitely the take on it all right so this is my take on take on that. I don't want you to copy a chart, but I want you to keep thinking. Keep thinking. Am I defending this hand profitably versus this guy? Versus the range he's playing with all the future mistakes that he will be doing and I will be doing. So the weaker we are, the tighter we want to be, the stronger we We are the more we can find spots maybe to make up for that EV Right to take even weaker hands with less equity to make something happen and generate that EV in the end Right. So maybe I should defend actually a little wider if I move down and play some zoom 50 to make a video I can definitely be loser definitely on. Definitely on the button. Definitely defending the big blind. Find check raises they have never seen before. Maybe attacking spots where they usually do not get attacked. But if I move up and I end up on, let's say, I'm playing NL 10k. And there was like a big recreational, but now he just left and I need to play a couple more hands. Why in this world should I open King Jack off from under the gun? It's definitely not making money for me in a lineup where some people are clearly better. This is something we need to evaluate. And like a big league is just for lots of people just trying to nail all the charts as if they were a given thing. Those are like some kind of solve things under some parameters with lots of assumptions on your flop turn river play and the fact is that it's so important for me is that we know already that all those assumptions are wrong because at least we know something about our game and we know that we will mess up all the time i mean i know that so i'm just guessing that all of you are like at least messing like similarly up somehow all right so really the question i'm asking myself even more is how much am i messing up compared to Willem. Okay let's see here, yeah as Sklansky said it is a trade of mistakes. Defending 7-2s off deep stake against whales are okay because their post-flop mistakes are worse than the pre-flop defend mistake. Absolutely, absolutely. This is a very very good take. Okay post-flop, let's go to post-flop. So this was my take on charts. Now we we get to postflop where you see already we are a little closer directional and a little less decisions left, right? So now preflop is over, we make a postflop decision, we only need to play turn and river perfectly or we mess it up there, right? So and here I want to do the same thing. I focus on playing as good as possible, which is like kind of the thing like that's not easy to do but to take care of, to think about how can I play better there. And I want to focus on villain playing as poorly as possible, right? Playing more hands against weak players. But I cannot design a game tree in a way maybe we can actually, but it's tougher to say like okay he's messing up more there because we cannot just know like maybe we know some leaks if someone is just very very passive and tight maybe i want to do lots of bets with lots of small sizes give him chances to fold maybe if someone is just clicking the call button maybe we want to use huge sizings which actually force him to fold a lot something like that is obviously, but it's always best to always look at yourself first. And the key to that, in my opinion here, how do we achieve that is always simplification. And now I actually have quite a couple of examples for you that I want to go through with you together to just showcase what I mean here. The goal of simplification, we will do lots of simplifications. I will discuss when they make sense, when they do not make sense. And the goal is just that we build our personal game tree. Actually, like I'm never telling my students like play this board, you should play it this way. I offer them things. I offer them. It makes sense to use a small sizing here. It maybe makes sense to use a big sizing as well and then you can create your very own game tree that you feel good with where you know that what happens on the turn right where you know what happens in the river a little better right it's like personal preference some others like checking and betting big as like a very polarized game tree and like then checking a lot and play that game tree and after betting big they know what's going on some others like betting small very very often to go with like a full linear range to the turn and then they know like exactly that they still have everything and they have mid pairs and bottom pairs and top pairs and so on so we've always wanted to simplify without giving up too much solver ev i call it it has nothing to do with really V because, well, we are messing up, villain is messing up. I will repeat that another 10 times this session. So it's really, I don't try to give up too much of that because whenever I do that, it means, well, if villain is playing perfectly now, I'm giving up EV. And maybe some people are playing like more perfectly than others others so it's like when i build a game tree a simplified game tree that is somehow not losing much solver eb i play way better and even if villain plays perfectly against that i'm not losing anything so this is just like a win-win scenario it's like here's like before it's always a trade-off do i make my game tree easier but put some room out there to get exploited or is that room actually so tiny that there is no room and i'm just making my life easier this is the spots we are looking for and the main goal here really is that we beat our villains by playing future streets better than them we want to prepare us to not mess up preflop is a preparation for the flop flop is a preparation for the turn and maybe on the turn of the river we can try to somehow play perfectly whatever right it's like messing up a huge river bet or not betting thinly enough for value or not having this or that these are big mistakes and then we are talking about like dollars or hundreds of dollars or depending on the stakes obviously but like really big amounts of big blinds. Preflop we are talking about all those odd zero point something numbers that are actually not mattering too much with all the play that comes after that. So first some guidelines and then we start I guess. Right here we go. So simplification guidelines. I always look at those big mix strategies, keeping a focus on is there a hand that clearly wants to use one certain sizing one certain sizing if you find a hand that is not mixed that says i want to bet huge that usually means that there is ev coming from if there is a hand that wants to bet small 50 percent and check 50 it just means i don't give a shit it's the same right this is how i want to see that it doesn't mean we need to mix it means do whatever you want feel free to build your game tree if you do this or that it's same maybe right so you can do whatever you want and this is how i want to see it it's like our freedom right then maybe one thing as well to understand is that small sizings actually make villains life tougher. Often simplifications lead to betting often small. Range betting for example. And this actually makes villains life tougher. If I use a huge bet, villain can just throw away let's say 50% of his range. And trust me, folding is easy when you don't have anything. Because like it's nothing else but forcing villain to play 50% of his hands perfectly. If the solver would fold and villain folds, he played perfectly with 50% of his hands, which is not great. If you see that small and you force villain to defend very very wide and add lots of check raises. He needs to play an aggressive style with lots of bullshit hands, which is definitely tougher. So actually it can happen that we make our life easier while making it tougher for the villain. And then the earlier the street, the more it's just a preparation for the next street, the more we should simplify, because it is our goal to prepare for the next street and play that then perfectly. So preflop, we are not talking about three open race sizings on the flop we will never talk about more than like three lines i call it right because check is not a bet sizing but kind of a line right it's a difference whether we only use one bet sizing but use check as well or we are actually range betting and this is just one line we are using we don't actually need to look at our hand this is peak simplification. Okay, love it. Or where is it here? I've seen something I want to comment on. Love it and hurt. Everyone is a fish concept. Also from Uri Pollack's podcast with the Wacko a few weeks ago. There was actually way more good stuff in there because those are both very great poker brains. And the Wacko is even like the Wacko is really in that business of not focusing on yourself, which like the most he's focusing on the these others he prepares game trees for himself that are not used often that people are yeah they are not used to it so they will mess up and he knows this game tree this is like he creates a tough game tree that's ev wise is kind of the same but he creates one that he knows how to play it and the others usually don't because no one else is playing it like this so this takes too much work for me because i like playing more but it's really like taking that that same concept and working on another area here i'm focusing more on ourselves whatever we can prepare and make easy for us and this was like another take but it was a really great podcast and i can highly recommend it yeah and now let's go let's get to our first example and actually I was too lazy to copy that all in the powerpoint so I'll just make it like that for now and just pull out some pyosims that I solved for you and we'll start with a very easy board that is actually I'm gonna find the right ones here that is actually 987 rainbow. For the example to have wide ranges to be freaking crazy we take I hope it's big enough for you if not i'll talk everything through anyways we'll get 987 and there's 987 multiple sizings we take a look first and i show you how i work here if you open up i don't know gto wizard or odin or everything this is a great tool they like those sims run forever i ran some scripts tonight so it was fine but it's still not the highest accuracy i don don't care here but they take forever. So it's great when you have something like that but now it's important to look at them in the right way. So here I actually only offered three sizings. Quarter pot, half pot and pot. And now I want to look at it with those eyes what is actually necessary. This is the game tree here. We see okay half Pod sizing is very nice maybe we could add like 75 as well or 40 or 35 and 25 is like somewhat there and now i want to look at the individual combinations and figure out what hands are actually clearly doing one thing i think we figure out that pocket tens we should not check right so this is learning maybe jack 10 we should not really check that often either and pocket fives are a pretty clear check as is like the ace five of no backdoor right so something like that we can see from that and now i want to take that and actually simplify that and here it's actually pretty easy we see i'm looking at this ev here this is the ev for in position this is like for like typical two five stack size so this is like one big blind is five dollars here so and there's like 5.5 big blinds in the middle so you can have like a rough estimation what that is in in big blinds i should have taken other numbers but this is just my my preset stuff i obviously just took the half pot as an option and let's have a look this is a strategy that i think is way easier to execute and if we look at the EV we actually see okay it's not very accurate already because the right sim actually has a higher EV but obviously the left sim could play exactly like that and if we keep that running forever the left side needs to be higher or at least exactly the same EV like this is not possible but this is how the solver works if it didn't run forever but this is enough for me to say like first simplification i'm not using three sizings i'm actually betting half pot or check maybe i can run it now and say like maybe 60 is a little better or 40 but trust me once you have done that a couple of times you see it's always the same and it just doesn't matter and here this is a big learning there okay we have an easy game tree now and maybe what i wanted to do next is pull out paint and just show you maybe a little visually what we did right so here villain checked to us and we are on the flop and i'll just draw the game tree we have multiple options on the left side we have the option to bet pot we have the option to bet half pot we had the option to bet quarter and we had the option to check and now obviously let's say villain is mainly answering by calling if he folds we don't care hand is over and once he's raising he is deciding everything and we can only react so once we do that like this it's obviously like four different game trees and this is what i mean for the turn play on the turn maybe we have multiple sizings as well and we need to think about okay what happened before like it's like a turn play after betting big turn play after betting half pot turn play after betting quarter pot and you see already like once like there's not even space if there's no space in paint for the river there is no space in our brain either so maybe let's have a look at the right game tree we can bet half pot or we can check and then we go from there and maybe on the turn let's see we simplify and only have like one size here as well size or check you see there's still room for the river play and this is a game tree we can execute this is what fc gensbach can work with and maybe try to have like a plan right so i like one coach we had actually who played like like before certain matches in the training with like two ways we try to get to the goal with like to have something like to not freestyle all the time she was like once every half time I want to see it at least right you have like we have one plan and this is like all that fits into FC Gansbach's brains and then it's like we were so incredibly often successful with those because we had one plan let's do this and Willem didn't know so it's like yeah it's way better than like always I have gazillion options which to take this time so this is a very nice simplification with actually losing zero ev all right so nice paint play here we go so this was the first uh feel free to ask questions again right i think this is a pretty clear one because it's so obvious that the pot size does not really make sense the small bet we see not a single hand that wants to bet the small sizing high frequency not a single one which means we don't need it so i can look at like a sim like that and know already i don't need anything else i know that this ev will be the same very very easy okay let's look at a little tougher board now again button versus big blind to have very wide ranges this was actually what i ran overnight so we have one two two, three, four, five sizings on the flop plus the check. I didn't offer too many race sizes but this usually doesn't change much. So let's see we offer five different sizings and the check. Yes take your players from Real Madrid and work with them on that. I think that's okay. I think they should maybe simplify to three sizings but actually we found a board where I mean probably accuracy is not the highest but it's decent already. Where actually all freaking five sizes are actually used. So how many turn sizes do you prefer in general? I'm never using more than two for a board. I'm not having like two sizings fit all boards but every individual board I'm using maximum two sizings. Preferably just one. Okay so here five sizings, good luck finding that. So it's like, again, now I could ask you, we overbet 150% on the flop, it does make sense. Pocket kings, they like to do it often, get the money in now. Pocket tens mix, they can bet small, get check raised, they can bet huge, get called, like all fine, right? Obviously some draws as additions, but bet huge, turn is a 10. Okay, now this leads to weird donking because we are not c betting too many 10x but what if villain donks how to continue there what if villain checks how to continue there it's just messing up because you cannot remember all that because if you bet half pot and you get the same turn card it's a very different thing way less donking because we are still protected with 10x all right then different sizings we are using and i could show the same like if we bet quarter pot actually the 10 shouldn't hurt us at all because we can bet yeah quarter pot we can bet any 10 in there we're like yeah this is where people may misapply concepts they have learned check call or like the yeah mid pier mid card peers donk is great yeah it depends right so really make your life simple know what you're doing exactly and then actually the turn card will be way better that's so so you're just saying just have one or two sizings yes but choose them per board i'm using 25 on some i'm using 10 on some i use 50 on some i use 100 on some i use 150 on. I know in my head like which sizings I use for which board. I'm never using more than two, but it's like you cannot run a script and say like the only sizings I'm using is like 25 and 75. That won't be enough. So we can look at that and now this is what we are doing right now right here. Which sizings do you want? I'm asking you which sizings like I want to use two sizings maximum. Which would you go for just saying okay the big size is necessary and then maybe one as a trade-off sizing here 15 and 150 i didn't start with 15 so let's make that i make the 15 to 25 is that okay alex 50 and 135 okay 25 and 50 like okay so what i did was like going step by step and i just started with small sizings because i like small sizings and i i talked about that already if we over pot villains allowed to fold 65 and it's actually not tough to fold pocket fives here or ace eight off so again villain's probably playing perfectly with 65 of his range so i'm not a big favorite against not perfect player and everyone is shit to use those large sizings it actually makes villains life easy if i bet small bill needs to continue 73 of his range including bullshit hands like a6 offsuit that wants to check raise sometimes ace8 offsuit that is not allowed to fold when it holds a spade but if it has the ace of clubs it's fine right it's like this is way tougher so i actually looked it up and see how much ev am i giving up for getting a way easier game tree right so now let's find that here one after another this year i guess is the one i'm looking for we intend seven so we see here this i only offered 25 isn't this a beautiful game tree and actually what did we just give up 15 cents we're playing big blind five dollars we gave up 15 cents isn't your life even harder when you deal with check race? No, because villain needs to find it first. And then I'm in reaction game in position with a linear range. It's like take this range on the right side, face a check race. You have sets, you have open enders, you have flush draws, you have everything. It's super easy to react with linear ranges when you're uncapped. It's like the easiest thing in the world, especially when you're in position. Right, so just compare those two. And I gave up 15 cents. So difference in EV is okay when simplifying, depends on how much it helps you to simplify. I give up 15 cents here against the perfect opponent. I think it's less against the non-perfect opponent, but now I'm sure I can play turns perfectly because I know my range. And this easily makes up for 15 cents. this is actually nothing in my eyes you can create something like this is not giving up anything and what do we get he bet seven okay if he check raises I told you for that reason that we have a linear uncapped range it's very easy to react so it's very likely that villain doesn't find this reaction here but if he calls turn deuce of hearts I know what's going on we're going to the moon let's go freaking crazy and this is a very easy strategy to play because i know it's like i'm value betting like queen nine plus and add the draws boom here we are and i use one sizing which is 150 let's go freaking crazy because i still have everything if i use the strategy on the left damn it i don't have kings in my small betting range anymore i don't have aces it's like i will mess up That's so do you intuitively know which sizings to use when in game or do you use thought process to reach that conclusion while playing? I'm in the game long enough that I have a good idea on which sports what makes sense at a small sizing here still I'm folding out King X and ace X hands that have equity I give a rather tough challenge to sixes fives fours threes deuces while as well I split his range on a board that changes a lot so once he only check calls he's rather capped this is why i chose that deuce of hearts and i can go crazy so on that board i know a small sizing makes sense on other boards maybe not right i know that okay big sizing makes sense because he has so many offsuit draws king nine king jack ace jack nine eight jack nine so it makes sense to attack them so big sizing makes sense i'm just a bigger fan of the small one all right so i looked at that one now this is fine a very easy game tree and actually let's get back to paint i can keep this one actually add a couple of sizings here this is the one we are talking about right now and what i just did was find a strategy i pay 15 cents in this spot against the opponent. So against a non-perfect opponent, I'm paying less than 15 cents. Maybe I'm actually winning. Like this is my little take on that because it's way tougher to play against that small sizing. And I don't even like, I don't need to look at my hand. And I start at the turn and that will look like that. And don't you think this is just on the one hand, a super nice robo smiley, obviously. But on the it's just a very very very very simple game tree that I like a lot. And so maybe if this is too simple for you guys we can have a look at the other sizing. 50 percent. I offered 50 percent as the next one. We see okay 50 percent is too much of an investment. We cannot bet full range. So we need that checking range. Which leads us to this next game tree that looks like this here, right? Two options, and we have to play two different turn game trees. This is tougher, where we see, okay, this is actually getting us closer. We are only giving up five cents, and then we need to do a little more of work playing two game trees after that. The checking and the bet half pot game tree. And this is now where I want to say, hey, this is my freaking job to figure out things right or we can say hey maybe i'm not the best player in the world i prefer easy i'm giving up a little i prefer easy because then i know what i get to the turn with don't have to handle with a check back and then facing bets of all sizes and i am always lost there you found a new game tree that just killed that like easy giving up much. Solver is solving for the best counter strategy against simple strategy. Yes. This year is the EV that we make if villain plays absolutely perfectly. So once he doesn't do that, our EV is through the roof. Obviously, once we get this executed perfectly. Same left. I'm not doing that. Hell no. I struggle with this year. I'm actually against most players just playing small bat range bet not worry about it anymore And my brain starts thinking on the turn makes it rather easy and then I make actually very good turn decisions, I guess But yeah, but if you playing a simplified strat and I'm playing a complex one you're responding different from optimal Well, I'm here talking about spot where I decide everything you can't do much here. You can only react reaction game, you can only react. If you try to play this game tree like in the spot the other way around, you can try so make more ev but I think as playing the reaction game like I see your sizing, I react is always way easier than making up things yourself. I think you mess up way more than that. Thought on exploitatively splitting range with multiple sizings if we claim that the ev of actions with specific combos isn't mixed in reality as we aren't playing, I call that cheating. Cheating is always allowed. If you know that I want to, let's say I go back to the quarter pot, let's we can see it on the left as well, I want to play everything quarter pot, but this guy I'm facing right now doesn't give a shit about my sizing and he plays his hand and he's passive, well hell yeah I take my kings and just bomb it to stack his queen x sure but then i still have a plan the plan is the one we've seen before and i adjust and i call that cheating i'm range betting but cheating with some some nutted vulnerable hands if you have more than two or three sizes if you have more than one sizing it's easy to make mistakes in practice the complex has much higher ev i mean we're talking about noits here right now. So you see the solver if someone plays perfectly there you see that there's no like not much more EV that you still want to exploit later on right. This is a different world right but as a standard against someone you don't know you don't know maybe he's as good as you. But it's like it's pretending that you are Real Madrid and the other guy is Gernsbach if you say this has more EV for you. Actually it's the other way around if it's the other way around. So it's like once you're on the same level the more complex game tree will just lead to more mess-ups from both of you and doesn't mean that it has higher EV for you necessarily. Absolutely Jetsu, here we go. Okay actually time is flying and I want to get at least like one, two, three months I think we get I guess so I have one more spot my favorite board button versus big blind actually so that I want to look at it's nine five twos rainbow and again we have a gazillion sizes to go with and yeah you see already now we can spot some things we see that over bat 17% of the time we see like pocket tens taking it pretty much always like ace nine taking a very high frequency small sizing and half pot sizing both the thing so it's like really tough again same like the queen 10-7 tough to find like the perfect one we see that ev here and we do just exactly the same we can run a sim or like just think about it what do we feel good about but here's a spot where i would say it's never possible to bet full range here we are just not strong enough on that board. So let's start with a 25 only. We can bet 70% and check and we are actually giving up 26 cents. So like the highest so far. We're like I need to check anyways so therefore using the small sizing when I don't get the benefit from just playing a range bet. Maybe not the best so this is the sizing that I can tell you. I'm playing with half pot against strong opponents because it's a simplified game tree if someone I think someone's better I give up five cents to play this game tree if I think someone is worse than me I play half pot and I play 135 percent pot actually because then it's fine for me I know I will mess up in that game tree that then has check plus two sizings. I know I will mess up turns and rivers. But if someone is weaker, that's fine for me. Against strong opponents, I keep my range together and take my pocket tens and bet half pot as well instead of going 135. If you note it, if you note something, it's always playing non-optimal versus still optimal. It's not taking into account that you will mess up as well. That's the big problem. The solver is the solver is always playing for the non-node lock thing that well you keep playing perfectly which is just ridiculous right it's like yes if i bet half pot here villain calls turns the queen of diamonds will i play the turn like that i mean it's still easy because it's only one sizing but i know i will mess up if i check back turn is whatever villain block bets checks to me whatever will i find those correct steps no i will mess up so this is what we don't see in the solver always we can pretend that we get and like we can we can copy the solver and and make that happen but i'm a big fan of just accepting that we are bad as well and this will lead to mistakes so i try to find a way that i can play optimally first it's yeah that's true simpl true simplifying is actually note-locking I mean for both players at the same time just leaving options out which makes it for me easier The great thing is that here if I only offer two sizings Villain solver knows if I do that in game villain does not know villain only faces the 25% bet for example We're here half pot. He doesn't know that I'm not never using the big bet. He doesn't know that I never use the small bet. And he doesn't know that I never use the over bet either. So it's like this year is kind of a symmetric knowledge in game. It's like, it's just, it's not at all. And it's like, if someone bets small, I still don't have the information whether he just uses the small bet or he uses multiple bet sizes. You think there will be ever a solver which is linked to to the player sets that would be a solver that tries to exploit something that's like it's a different kind of solver in my understanding solver is getting to like the theory of the game which means solver plays versus solver once you link it then it's like a an exploit maximizer i wouldn't call it a solver it's will have like something with that will will exist for sure that's like database analysis that people are doing already maybe they do it by hand or they actually have it's like node locking nothing else what are your thoughts of donking i i want to understand when it makes sense and that i can put people into uncomfortable positions that they haven't seen too often so i actually quite like it but again it's a spot where i know i will mess up more because i haven't seen it too often and i know villain will mess up more so it's kind of again a thing where if i'm the better player overall i think it's a great tool i wouldn't start freaking mixed donks against linus again because i know he will mess up less against that then i will by doing that myself and i have way too much else to learn than like creating crazy donking game trees that come up once every three days to then own people because I know the game tree and they don't. So it's kind of more thing that happens on the go where well obviously I'm donking rivered value against recreational players that obviously have like a top pair that did value bet or something like that. This is something that is very very important but again it's that thought process of are they better or worse than us. All right, I rush a little to get to the end there because I have another one, two very nice ones I wanna show you. This one. This time we play a three bet pot and we are small blind versus button. I didn't offer too many sizings, actually just three this time because I just ran it just before the coaching. I offered 25, 50 and 75 out of this and we are small blind three better versus button caller on ace, king, five rainbow. And this is the output we are getting. A small bet is fine, but sometimes big betting with something like that doesn't want to see the gut shots getting there like ace king it doesn't want to check against the peers like betting big makes a lot of sense there as well from the big blind it would be even more polarized there and yeah this is a strategy i want to show you here where again i could now keep going and paint but paint, but this will always look the same. We have four strategies that we need to use. Maybe we can combine those two, but it's like very, very tough. So what I did there was just finding a sizing where I have a way more simple game tree, where small blind versus button, one size. And actually I chose a 15% sizing, a very small one to just attack his pockets and his full shit with some backdoors. That allowed me to finally go for the range bet, but I didn't run it long enough I think we see already that every hand is fine betting so we can bet full range and we're giving up again Like in this pot you always have to see it relative It's like 30 cents, but in a way bigger pot already So relatively it's not much where the question is is villain answering perfectly against this game tree or against this I think people can mess up versus the check So if people mess up against the check and not find the bluffs so we can over fold Exploitatively or they are just going too crazy with everything that can be a thing But what I think is like playing as this big bet is very easy We just force them to fold when they don't have anything while playing versus this year villain needs to call every single pocket pair Which I think like for example if I play zoom 200 for the stream I don't have anything. While playing versus this here, Villa needs to call every single pocket pair which I think, like for example if I play zoom 200 for the stream, I don't see anyone calling pocket 8, 7, 6s here so actually I can print money here with something like that and actually make the game tree tougher because I force people that are not capable of playing very loose ranges and understand sizings, I force them to keep going with lots of hands like that that they don't like continuing here by using like sizings and actually here you see again the most simple game tree of everything like and my brain starts thinking on the turn. So you're more on Dominic Nietzsche's side of simplifying? I don't know his side on simplifying. I think he has like multiple sizes I mean DTO has lots of sizings like his program, but like not going too wild. But I don't want to take a side I want to show how I think he has like multiple sizes. I mean DTO has lots of sizings like his program, but like not going too wild But I don't want to take a side. I want to show how I think here It's not a side you can play that game tree as well but I want you to understand this is the big point of that coaching that we need to take into account that we know that we mess up and we Know that villain messes up that we should not take solvers as a given thing that we try to copy and actually yeah let's let's that i think should be good enough for examples because it's kind of repetitive in the end it's and it's more fun to do it yourself so now i want to get back to this here again let's see because i have a little more here to showcase again what is very very important just seeing when you small bet a lot more do you run the risk of them hitting something and stacking you that they normally would fold on flop yes run the risk have the upside of them calling something they fold later and they invested more money with it or example ace king five they hit to the second best hand if i have aces or kings and they have nines and they hit a nine i'm fucking loving it right so when they hit their set so it's it's kind of flops like that if something is more dynamic things change a little okay so now i want to show you something again a little look into my brain how i want things to work i know that there are lots of people working like this little organization diagram on the left i call that the solver nerd business organization which works in that way that this guy might be discussing this is what the arrows is like like having information flowing from like one side to the other and the other way around and they are discussing but they are just taking like the solver as a given thing and so the solver is making their strategy and they try to copy they double check did we do things right with the solver if solver says no it's wrong where i want to see that way different right the solver is not the given thing because it's not the real world it's like not i'm not playing with solvers and i cannot execute solver strategy myself so i rather see that as i'm i didn't want to put me on top but in a way for my poker business i'm making the decisions i'm responsible for that i take the solver i treat him as assistant in a way and this is why i made two arrows i'm asking the solver things and he's like i'm not taking him as a given thing i'm asking him i say like what if like which of those five sizings do you like and then i'm telling him you know what i'm just using one show me how good that is or i'm using another one how good is that can i bet everything how is it like it's more like working together and i'm asking questions and the solver answers right the same way i talk to like my poker friends maybe including the solver as well like i'm doing this what do you think of that like it's simplified then by a lot do you think it's way easier to react to that or it's actually making life tougher for villain what do you guys think about it or i have maybe on the side as well doing lots of coachings or coaching like this for you just taking my thoughts and put them into paint or just writing them down obviously like makes them more clear and more and more clear for myself to really express things and really have those in my mind when i'm actually playing myself but it's like a very very different perspective whether i'm making the decisions and i'm using a tool to help me those decisions or i'm taking the solver or the tool as like the masterpiece that i try to copy and this is the one and only truth because it shouldn't be if we are playing solvers if I'm trying to beat Tio or not lose against it well it's not working to beat it by definition if I play against it then it might be different then I try to copy the solver because my best answer is just to play exactly like it that would be a different thing but that's not the case and this makes poker such a beautiful game that we all love and yeah so I use the solver to find ways to beat up my villains and then we can go from there. Right so what you're saying Mauseltshaus what yeah lower stakes people are non-elastic with hands they call for 0.15 or 0.3 if they feel like calling go bigger with value hands perfectly fine. On boards that change though like very dynamic boards it's actually nice to split their range because maybe against a big bet they only call their strong hands while against a small bet they are raising so whenever you bet small and they only call you know they don't have it and then on brick turns you can go even crazier right so it's like there are multiple multiple reasonings but feel free to exploit this is more like having your standards against players that are maybe on the same level to evaluate whether players are better maybe you want to keep your game tree simple to not mess up or if people are really bad make it as complex as you want if you know their hand play against their hand if you know how they react with everything play your hand versus their range do whatever you want right play like a monkey on drugs if you're the way better player you know you can do anything and they mess up more but just keep in mind you will be messing up in the same way i will be everyone will be which factors am i looking for with choosing bluffs in the larger size well i'm thinking about which hands are continuing versus the larger size whether you want the other way around which hands are folding against the larger size so the hands that are folding with larger size but calling versus a smaller size well that tells me that i want to bet hands large that do especially well or do it poorly against the hands that fold to the big size but call versus the small size so my example of nine five deuce the first one is i want to over bet jack ten because that folds out king jack and king ten that's like the first example. Those hands that would, for example, call a small bet. And actually, the home game is starting right now. So I hope you guys are in already. If not, there's 45 minutes of late drag. And now we are getting to the end with the key takeaways. For me, it's so important that really understanding what the solver shows you. And then we need to accept that it's not possible for us to copy that. We are shit the solver the solver is real madrid or fc liverpool or by a munich maybe in germany if we are freaking low stakes club and we are poker wise right every one of us we shouldn't try to copy that we can't right build your ranges and your game trees based on your skill level maybe relative to villain's skill level we talked about pre-flop start with something tight right start with something tight once you're still not an experienced poker player maybe go a little crazier when you're pretty good already and we learned that simplifications can actually make villains life tougher at the same time villain does not know that we only use one sizing and he won't find out maybe on 5k when we play the same dice over and over again but not on nl5 not on nl10 not on nl25 nowhere right not in your local casino and the earlier the street the more room for mistakes on later streets so you want to keep things as simple as possible keep it super simple pre-flop keep it somewhat simple on the flop maybe you can start like exploiting starts for me maybe a little against really bad players i start exploiting on the flop a lot pre-flop obviously as well, but then the big exploits are on the turn. Against some I'm not bluffing the turn anymore, 0%. Against others I'm just bluffing everything, like, or stuff like that, choose different sizings and so on. That's it for everyone, I hope you liked it. First of all, thanks for tuning in everyone. A little homework, I started doing that for everyone who is interested, to just give you something if you want to put more work in. It very easy this time i want you to take any spot find a solution or feel free to ask for for a solution discord for a certain spot there are people that are ready to help you out like something with many options and then simplify it to your needs you don't need solver for that just you can draw a paint you can say i do this and that for this and that reason and so on just try it try it and execute that don't be too crazy you can be creative you can say like i do this i bet 10 or i bet pot like do crazy things fuck up people that's perfect right and then i want you to share those game trees in discord right we can exchange like exchange thoughts there i have a look over them this is obviously for the poker code members that have access to discord for every follower who is not a Poker Code member yet, obviously I would be super happy if you sign up to Poker Code and then we see us each other in the next non-free coaching. For everyone else, there will be, I think next month coaching is probably hosted by Fedor again. And yeah, thanks for tuning in.
