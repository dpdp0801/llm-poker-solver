### TOPIC: cash mistakes
 All right we'll talk about my top five mistakes today and obviously the coaching is not here for myself to figure out mistakes that's a list I came up with just the first five out of my head but I want to use those to show you how many areas there are that you can improve in. So the agenda for today is something I will call off on and around the table. What exactly that means I will talk about in a second. I'll have to give a little shout out to my friends from Poker Ambition here. I don't know, I think it's coming from them. They call it the FIFA rating, which I like a lot. It's just nothing else but putting kind of numbers for what we will be talking about when we talk about off on and around the table. And then we'll get to my top five mistakes. I made a little list and yeah, always some key takeaways that you can do and now let's start and talk about what I mean with off, on and around the table. This is actually one of the first sessions that I like for private students that I'm always giving to just talk about areas that we are going to work in or that I expect people to work in to get better. So this comes from like ideas that were like brainstormed where I thought about okay let's treat my poker journey as a little business and this business has a little goal which is making money so that I get better here right? That I run a good business and I want to divide and conquer that. So as many things as possible is cool and the first step is usually that I'll just ask you hey the last time you did something to work on your game on your business on whatever what exactly did you do right it's like usually something if you can explain to me what you exactly worked on you really made progress and if you can't like if you just tell me i did content i whatever i don't know i reviewed hands okay cool maybe with which purpose then that's okay but not really like that effective probably so now i started splitting that up into off table really the work we put in and only have like yeah off the table where it matters and my explanation for that is just the basic theory knowledge just knowing what you could right it's just you need to be very good in theory at some point and you can study that and so on. And a lot of people who are very, very good off table in theory, usually you find lots of coaches who are not necessarily the best players are the best coaches. This is the same in every sports kind of, right? But people that can explain very well or just people who have that knowledge. So yeah, I just met, I don't know, maybe some of the German speaking people know him a little better it's like paul otto internet was his username he was a great player but never really played high stakes but i think he's the best coach i've ever known and it's pretty much for me the explanation is more if you could answer all the questions that are there in poker theory treat it as a school exam but without time limit so take all the pressure away like no time bank, no nothing, no actual playing. Just like questions that you need to answer like how do you construct your range here? What do you do there? What is your open there? How do you adjust to these and that players? And so on. Just knowing that is like a very, very good foundation. It does not necessarily mean that you're a big winner. All right, so this is the first thing off table and And if you think about how could you improve that, first things come to mind, playing GTO Wizard, thinking yourself, just talking to friends, watching some poker code videos, for example, attending this coaching here, if it's about a specific topic and so on, lots of things. And now the second thing is on the table. And I think it's pretty obvious. On the table just means what you actually do there. Like maybe to put that into perspective, I think I'm way better off table than I am on table. No clue why, whether I'm a little too emotional or I don't care too much about mental coaching or whatever. Sometimes I get emotional. Sometimes I do stuff, even though I know it's not correct. It's the execution of that knowledge. For me, it personally always somehow helped, especially live when I played because it will add like adds like some other kind of element that i really wanted to give my very best and it didn't allow me to do something stupid but yeah execution of that knowledge so you could be the best coach and the best theory poker player but still you could be failing on the table right just because your execution is not good so you could think about things just to get better at that could be mental coaching could just be having some ideas how you treat yourself during a session right session length for example like the food you have before like your sleeping schedule some like all that plays a role and is a part of the whole show as well and i think that's a tilt management or maybe maybe not playing when being tilted understanding how you react to tilt i get more aggressive i love jamming ace five suited against the four bet when i'm a little let's say on fire so and i know that so maybe that helps me to then stop it and the last thing around the table i want to ask you guys any idea what i could mean with around the table like with off the table work as poker theory on the table the execution of what we've learned of that poker theory and around the table what could could mean with around the table. Like with off the table work as poker theory, on the table the execution of what we've learned, of that poker theory and around the table, what could I mean with that? There are no wrong answers, just gathering ideas. It's something that I consider as like around the table that is not a definition. Sleep, diet, exercise, well-being, I actually count that more into execution just because that leads to your well-being, to you being fit, to you having a higher chance to perform at a high level ausgleich in german here just to have something else right let's say play football in the evening or something to not have poker only interesting i didn't think about that cognitive flop very interesting taking notes yeah actually this is more like off table for me personally but this is very good stuff social they're working set up i think very good could be partly execution you see. You see it's a big mix. For me, it's around the table. It's more when you decide like, where do you put your work in and when do you put your work in? Just thinking about something like when you have like 24 hours in the day and you think about, okay, when are you going to grind? Let's say you have eight hours, but you're flexible when you put them in. It can make a big difference whether you play from like 3 p.m. in the afternoon till I don't know, whatever whatever, eight hours later is. Or from like the middle of the night or the early morning or something like that, right? Back then, Zoom 500, my daily business, I did a time analysis. When are the best win rates? When is the pool the best? And so on, right? Just that you are more effective with that. You could do something like around the table is, what are you playing? Table selection kind of. Site selection, where are you playing? Maybe not that much now, but something like affiliate selection that you get the best deals possible to just get the most out of what you bring on the table. Your off table stays the same, your on table stays the same, but you could just make way more money, for example. Table selection as well, maybe you can put on the same skill level on NL 200 and on NL 50 well it's not about the limit usually it's more about the skill level of this certain table if you find a very very very good nl200 table it could be way better performing there than on a very bad nl50 table obviously so drinks food mobile phone consumed during the live session yes that's like mix of those two as well right around the table would for me for the live trips would be just the trip selection. Where are you going, for example? And yeah, lots of stuff like that. Lots of stuff to optimize that actually when you just keep off and on the table the same, that, well, just makes your business decision better in the end. All right, this is just a little how I see the poker world. And now to the FIFA rating, I guess you can bet already where it's going.'s just like an image from ahead right that really you could every one of us probably who is a little into football or any other sports knows those i call the fifa rating i guess there's like other stuff the same right so here is kind of you you have divided your football game into like pace into shooting into passing into defense into dribbling into like what is the like physis like just a physical just how strong you are kind of and we could do the same for poker right obviously off on and around the table is just a start but if you can tell me where your strengths are and your weaknesses that's very good like my biggest strength is poker theory yeah not so good is maybe the execution for me it's very important that i have like a kind of a daily schedule let's say or that I'm really into it I can't do the I play one day now then I'm three days off then I play another day again Then my execution is shit, even though my theory knowledge obviously I don't lose it within three days But it's a different feeling for me like being there and executing so this is like something personally that I know where I know Okay, I need certain surroundings to really play effectively and maybe maybe then other parts as well. We get to that a little later. So here, the idea is divide different areas of the poker theory. That is like, okay, maybe your preflop is great. Maybe your flop game is great. Maybe your check raising game tree is great. Maybe your call down game is shit because you always think like, okay, they have it or they don't have it. And you always fold, you always call. You know, you might even know the theory like slightly but it's you hate it right it's okay right know about it divide different areas of execution right just understanding okay well like do you do well in certain times do you do well at certain like i don't know like when is the feeling when you are in the zone and so on so on and other areas i didn't want to go too much into detail right i don't want to do like a site selection here or affiliating or whatever. Like let's call it mainly table selection is the most obvious one, I guess. Yeah, FIFA ratings seems like a general approach and points, absolutely. Just like if you figure out right here, I think actually I copied this one from Thomas Müller. No clue why he's that slow. Obviously my pace would be way higher. I think my defending is, my dribbling would be shit for me. My dribbling is shit. My legs are just way too long for that. My shooting is okay. My passing is okay. I think my defense is clearly stronger compared to the others. I'm not on the Thomas Müller level. Definitely not. But all right, to just know, okay, where you are. And maybe like start something in your head for opponents you see a lot as well. That you're like, actually, this is what he does well. And another part where where he maybe has his big leaks it could be could be reads whatever but it's a way of thinking that helps you okay finding leaks finding your own leaks and kind of obviously working on our biggest weaknesses will always be very very effective because it's easier to get from like a 56 in defense to a 65 than it is to get in shooting from 84 to 91 and i want to say 93 to have nine points each. All right so I guess that's pretty clear what I mean and now I think is the time to get to my top five. This is quick when I never pull out GTO Wizard. Actually this might be the first session where I'm not like extending 15 to 20 minutes so we'll always find something to do no worries but now we'll get to the my top five that I came up with the last three days so let's start with number one or actually number five right and this is where that session actually comes from number five is sticking to preflop ranges is where i came up with the topic was our last poker code member session the community session i did last month was just about preflop advanced we were talking about how it's stupid to have preflop ranges. It's a good baseline. It's not stupid to have them, it's stupid to play them. Like fixed. It's a good start. It's a starting tool for starters. But if you want to go deeper you need to be more flexible. We talked a lot about everyone who has missed it make sure to get on the platform. I'm not summarizing the whole whole session. I think we had a great session on that. Actually planned way more and we only talked about open raising and defending and it was freaking interesting so there's so much room to be better in that area of the game and this is something i did very very poorly and um i can tell you a little little story of myself i was playing on full tilt back in the days i played what was called rush rush poker i was like playing in a 100 and trying to move up to nl 200 and through like the poker strategy forum i found another guy who plays that already i was friends with a little then after a while and he let me look over his shoulder see a little i was like oh interesting it was full ring he open raises ace three to ace five suited from under the gun under the gun plus one under the gun plus two like this is what i didn't do oh that's a game changer this was my logic right like everything else was like the same and then post slope no clue you do whatever you think i was like okay now i'm a crusher i know what's the difference he has suited aces in his under the gun range as well and obviously this doesn't change a shit right so it was like in my early early poker days i thought okay i have a new range now something is slightly different this has to make the difference right and now obviously i can't help myself i need to log into your wizard just to show that as well small part out of the last coaching maybe and all i know is just an opening range and to just show you maybe i find even full ring should be there right maybe even for cash study all right so let's have a look cash nine max 100 big blinds big blinds, and a 50 only, okay, whatever. Under the gun. And what we've seen now is, okay, we make 8.53 big blinds by opening pocket aces. That's our EV, right? We talked a little about how important it is to understand those absolute numbers. You look down at pocket 10s under the gun and you love it. It's freaking 0.11. It's like, yeah, it's actually fine timing out every now and then, right? So it's like, yeah, not great. Looking down at ace queen off, it's not 0.11 it's like yeah it's it's actually fine timing out every every now and then right so it's like yeah not great looking down at east queen off it's not really making money to be honest and this was like the ace five ace four ace three is like a zero zero and a 0.02 and i thought this is a game changer yeah like just cannot be so now with my honor saying no like my problems have been somewhere else definitely i can tell you now that it was postflop and preflop didn't matter at all and i was one of those guys who was like opening pocket kings flop is 965 bet bet small bad river hate when getting raised sometimes calling sometimes folding always looking into a set like okay cool that was maybe not the best strategy but yeah it was maybe a little theory mistake that is not in the list but really this is what we talked about those absolute numbers and i thought back then okay it's a freaking new thing i learned and so on so what i did is i believed small change makes me a crusher if i use the fifa ratings this back then in my just in my head right it's nothing you need to write down or so i know like okay my prefab ranges just changed a little bit so this is like maybe one out of 50 different points i could evaluate and i got from like maybe an 85 to an 86 now because i i add that like i think this is even too much of a jump for that nothing so it's clear that this cannot change anything and it's like often we just want to rate our different parts of the game and this was my number five mistake does anyone feel like oh this might be him like just thinking his pre-flop game is off like just looking for the next chart and thinking this this changes something for him or like just like really thinking deeply about whether 10-8 suited is an open or whether you need 10-9 or it's 10-7 and i can tell you from now on it doesn't matter it's really not the big deal it doesn't change wherever it's close it's so close to 0 eb that is really not a game changer and this is what I want you to understand because I didn't back that. Hey, Paul Pantz. My biggest leak. When should we stop going for more precision preflop over other areas of the game? You can stop preflop very, very early. Very, very early. Any chart you have is fine. You just need to know what you're playing. Move on to postflop. This is where things get interesting. Talking about open raising and defending. Obviously, 3-betting and so on, it gets a little more dice dicey my biggest leak is i forgot to think about some basic stuff well if you start open raising a7 off from under the gun that's a big big big problem you need a freaking foundation all right maybe that again for everyone who's more of a starter here i gave in that that little pre-flop coaching i gave that image here where i say like your whole game is like a pyramid and pre-flop is here right and then you build on that build on that build on that if you build a foundation like that and then you try to build your your freaking good post-flop game on that it will crash right this is not working but if you cut something off on the side right let's say your pre-flop game is not perfect it's more like you cut it off here cut it off here or you're too wide look you do like something like it looks like this maybe this either way doesn't matter the pyramid won't fall off so you need like a solid foundation but don't argue with your friends whether you should open raise king jack off from middle position or not whether you should play those suited aces from under the other your decision feel free it's just understanding in my eyes those absolute numbers everything that has a clear plus ev number is important to have this makes money everything else is else is more like optional. If you say like okay I want to keep an easy game post-flop, feel free to open race under the gun pocket nines plus. You're a freaking nit, it's okay. If you know that post-flop on a board like four or five six you can't do anything. Not really not anything right. Not say like yeah but people think I have this and that. No you know what you have that's important. But you can go freaking crazy and on something like ace king jack you can keep bluffing your pocket nines all the way. Let's take like a queen jack ten where you really have all the straights and you just always have something. This is the knowledge that your foundation needs to be somewhat solid and not like totally shaken off. Alright, I forgot thinking about position that I haven't like under the universe cut off or pot. Yeah, position is a a big thing right here I'm expecting everyone is happy about every beginner in here But I'm expecting that everyone can find or just google pre flop poker charts six max or nine max when we face mixed strategies Some hands race or call is it important to remember right frequency or is no matter is only about to know the option in RNG In some way you can even make your decision 100 or. People won't find out if you don't play the same people every freaking day. It just says that in the theory world this hand doesn't make money but it doesn't lose either so it doesn't matter and then it's more like a thing to keep your frequencies under control but people do not find out frequencies. It's like they need a lot of sample, find out frequencies. Whether you open raise ace four suited from under the gun or not people won't find out after 5 000 hands all right so if you find anything else but an rng to make your decision that's better for example a tight big blind or someone like button who is never three betting something like that did you stop playing on gg a high rate no i just don't find the time for gg i need to have long sessions to make it worth because mainly you're playing to finally get a vip and with my son and it being summer i do not play longer than like 90 minutes or two hours straight what about the small line versus big blind spot i'm still confused if i need to learn how to use mix strategy but i need to know how to defend grace to three 3.55x i'm using 3x only in the small blind boom no limping if there is no anti no different sizes as simple as it is i think that answers the question does your son know what a flush is already maybe the toilet flush but should be close all right so let's go to number four and this is i think actually the one that doesn't hurt me most but it's like a little inside like why why freaking how long were your sessions when you were up and coming i mean back then i was i was still studying so whenever i found time but my the start of my like poker career when i moved to brighton my full day in Brighton, it was always raining and that was it. So I was there playing and doing theory. That's it basically. So yeah, not 24 hours. I tried to catch some good sleep, but I got up when I got up and I did theory in the morning and then I played a session. I did some reviews in theory. I played a session, did some reviews theory. And then in the evening there was like a long night session because i was living with tournament players and i was playing until there was no action anymore 3 a.m 4 a.m and then i went to bed and same thing the next day seven days a week all right let's get to number four giving others too much credit this is something it was like always like a burden okay like moving up to nl 10 moving up to nl 25 moving up to nl 50 moving up NL 100. As if it's a different player pool and it's a different game. Let me tell you, it's not. On average, people are a little better. But there are tougher tables on NL 50. Then there are like, there is a tougher, you will find a tougher table on NL 50 than some tables on NL 100. And the other way around. So you should either see that as like the selection of players that are ready to play for a little more money. Obviously the toughest table in NL100 will be slightly tougher than the toughest table on NL50. And the toughest tables on NL1K will be tougher and so on and so on. Yeah, but it's not a big game changer. And it's like, people are not looking for you. Like, oh, he just moved up from NL50 and we are the sharks now. This was my feeling like, oh, I'm the little guy now trying to move up. I don't see it even. And when we are talking about nl100 and lower people don't know each other really it's so many people sure the guys you play every day with but that's about it right it's like yeah no if you even mix sides or something it's like no and i knew my stuff right it's like i knew i beat nl50 let's say i crush it like why am i not playing the same game on l100 i really had that in myself like oh he's a wreck he's four tabling on l100 he will have bluffs here he will catch me correctly and I stopped taking the spots that I knew were correct on the limit before like maybe that is execution maybe that's like yeah I mean the league is giving others too much credit I consciously decided to do that and I remember at times like just making bluff catches that I thought on the the other level are just bad but let's say bad variants I faced like three Czech jams on the river in a session like I can't be true those guys are crazy over here they're so aggressive and so on where nowadays if we look back let's say this is 90 I'm so old nine ten eight years back everyone was under bluffing everything like maybe there were some maniacs like Tom Duan or something but like on mid stakes people were playing their hands and maybe finding some bluffs when they were a little emotional but that's about it yeah exactly deep into mortar that's it kind of natural you started like that since you didn't have any experience on those limits yet yeah but you treat a new level like a new game the game is poker whether you played for $2 for $2, for $10, or for $50, or for $5,000. The game is the same. Why should you play differently? Like having an expectation that something that worked on that limit or was correct, maybe just, is not correct on something else. Actually, what I did by that is I pretended to be smarter than all of them by changing my strategy and pretending that I know what they do. It's, yeah. It's like especially this he's so good he will bluff, have bluffs here. Let's be honest when I jump into for the videos into like a 100 pool and a 50 pool I get lots of messages in the chat. Like okay people know the star is named Goosegore, some at least. And this is exactly the same that I feel. I get paid off everything. My bluffs don't work. The big ones where I know he has something and i try to move him off obviously if they have nothing they fold just like and i guess this is the main reason i would love to play with an anonymous account on like nl50 and and things would go through way way way more all right and then another thing that is part of that giving others too much credit that i tried to play balance even with the read it's like i know he's over calling but this bluff i need to go with because I wanted like on those stakes I can't be that crazy no that's bullshit I were actually when moving up something that really helped is overconfidence and actually with my results on the lower stakes this is what maybe I should have built confidence not over I mean overconfidence in a way right to just say like no I'm crushing let's crush the next guys like I always present like Fedor as an example he's like no i want to move up i want to move up like let's go they are all idiots i think this kind of helps you grow grow as a player way way way quicker kind of naturally you serve so patrick antonio said on table i don't see money i see big blind only exactly right and l2 is lots of big ones actually nowadays you have you can just show big blinds that helps me personally a lot people have gloves have bluffs here, they never bluff 22 and 23. Absolutely, yeah. Cool. So, I hope that there are some people here in the chat that experience that right now. Maybe you just move up from NL 10 to 25. Maybe from NL 5 to NL 10. Or maybe you're already in mid stakes somewhere, a few of you. Forget about that. Treat them the same. It's the same, right? Maybe it's even sometimes the same players. Don't think you are smarter than the whole system it's like no on nl200 they are folding they're whatever they are bluffing and so on so grunge34 says i just play too tight when i go up to nl100 have no confidence to fight with regular there even the pool is still making some mistake that can make it profitable absolutely nl100 they are playing 100 not 500 not 1000 so just pretend that you are that good and you can call them shit it's like that's okay right so if that helps you right they're obviously not shit they're very good poker players but there is a way to be better and one thing that would help me nowadays a lot with showing it in big minds is that i can't choose the stakes i'm playing like back then i was like either playing in a 50 or in 100 like mixing was weird with the different sizes that you needed to type in and so on but nowadays I would go and move up from like an L50 to let's say to an L60 2.5 is that right I don't know like by just having three tables of an L50 and one table of an L100 right and just showing it all in big blinds it's like it's average stake but all the tournament players know that right you play You play like all the $11 tournaments. That's not all you do. Like obviously you add like the $8 tournaments that might be there and like the good $15 tournament, right? It's just your average stake is important. Obviously the variance on the one table is a little more important for your bank roll, but still your average stake is fine. And that would have helped me a lot instead of like having those big jumps. It would be more like a steady, a steady steady uprise you have tips for getting confidence back after losing sessions in cash well every second session should be a losing session pretty much so i always after a couple of losing sessions let's say i reviewed more i reviewed more and tried to understand where the money comes from i called net ev like if aces go in versus kings i know it's happening the. So actually nothing happened, it's just bad variants. But finding out something where you paid off something that was maybe stupid, where you actually just like lost real money or yeah, where you win something because you got a big donation from a recreational, that's like where your actual money comes from. Just trying to evaluate better, being more and more precise, that helped me personally. All right, I was streaming from Ukraine, I see that L100 players play silly games, not different from those on L2 and L5. Let's crush them, only matters to having bankroll for this game. Yeah, come to Omaha guys, that's another good thing. Okay, let's move on. Number three waiting for us and that kind of sticks a little to number four as well, right? Giving others too much credit, not really being happy early with what I achieved. My plan never was to be like a poker pro. My plan was never to play the highest stakes. My plan was never to crush or whatever. Thank you. with what I achieved my plan never was to be like a poker pro my plan was never to play the highest stakes my plan was never to crush or whatever like I didn't give a shit I was the type of guy who did the math what my hourly is an l25 and how cool that is maybe for a student that I get like 150 euros on average a month or maybe 250 or something that's like I was looking short term like I love the chance of making the let's say comparably small money back then and really like i can put in volume i like kind of safety i think this is like a personal background thing a lot where figor started off like i want to be the best i mean he got broke like three four or five times i don't know there are enough interviews where he talks about that like this was a absolute no-go for me for example like i think throughout my career my chances of going broke were no like there was one spot where it might have happened when i had like a 800 roll and like i was really tilted after losing a little and if i got one big bad beat if i keep losing that i might i might blast it off on like some bullshit game but yeah for for fit or his expectation was probably to go broke like even more often who knows right so it's a very very different personal setting which like i don't want to don't get me wrong there it's not a bad thing it's like a very personal thing like how people are but as like if the goal of your poker business let's see it that way is to make money this was a very very poor decision by me right i should have moved up way faster way more aggressive bankroll management, being way more confident, playing higher games and so on. I see the chat is going a little wild here. Let's see. Thierry went broke with MTTs. I don't know what he played like in his first year. He tried and binged and so on. How to go broke in cash game with dropping stakes. Yeah, but you need to drop stakes. It's like for some people, it's then once they reach NL50 they will never leave it but yeah so really it's different levels throughout the career i think the first moment where i had that feeling of being happy with what i achieved was actually playing a tournament as like an absolute fun player i was trying my best on like nl5 nl10 maybe even nl25 and i played like one tournament i don't even know whether it was a free roll or I just somehow clicked in it. And I was on the final table and it was just before my work and travel in Australia. I think there was like 5K on top. And I was like, wow, winning this is like, would just be pretty much what I need for the trip. And that's cool, right? So that would be awesome. And then like, I'm super happy and not thinking about the poker career or anything at that point obviously and yeah i obviously busted and got like 700 bucks which was still super nice and that was like the first thing and then just throughout the rising up through the ranks like just bankroll management and like i hated moving down so not that i was aggressive then with my bankroll management but i knew i hate to move down so i waited very very long with moving up but i needed to build that confidence personally instead of i was way too good for like 10 25 already after like doing some basic theory there but yeah i mean it was still pretty easy like in those times and that kept growing and i think the biggest moment where i could have done something is like how long i stick to nl 500 and 200 zoom instead of playing other tables i added more and more zoom tables i was capable of playing eight zoom tables without a big problem it was beautiful when they had zoom 1k that was where i felt the best just printing money while then i have seen like one year later or so and in a tracking site what other people that did the same before did and they were let's say the same skill level we were just fighting every day and they were good and I was good and they started scripting which back then was still allowed and they were getting all the good seats and higher stakes I wasn't even ready to play theset wise, I would say. But you get used to it pretty quick if you just start it. And I made like, I don't know, I was S&E back then. So that's like 100, 120k in rakeback plus the winnings. And like all of them made like a million plus. And like, okay, this is very, I mean, I had some winnings. But like, that's very, very far away. I clearly lost business wise to those guys right so this is the thing and now coming to what i see here what i wrote down is actually when we talk about live tournaments where fedor and the other germans we were just crushing everything to 16 to 17 and what made us crush is that we actually had a huge edge and i could tell you exactly leaks our opponents. I could tell you exactly where our edge is. It's like they are 20 big blind stage. They're 30 to 40 big blind stage. Like some of the American team was not great. They didn't work together as we did sharing reads and so on. Just talking. We were just living together in the hotels pretty much. That was our big upside. And then, well well i think every one of the crew decreased the amount of work they put in i obviously fedor kind of fake retired whatever you want to call it like decided to play less all the others were like just more a little more cherry picking the spots just expecting to keep crushing right which you see here what i did was like i was taking less lifestops as well and i mixed formats and expected to win online as well and i mixed online tournaments online cash live tournaments i mean it's not that we are the poker gods and crush everything no we were good because we work more and harder and better together than others and some of us maybe had a very good variance on their side as well but we stopped that and it's quite obvious while let's say for the super high rollers the americans just they kind of teamed up that bothered them that we were winning so much and they teamed up and they got really way way way better then there was a certain point where i have to agree i think like i didn't know where the edge is coming from against the other x that's the point where it sucks where you need to admit like okay they are probably better right now. But this is something where now I'm super happy with my decisions to play less and so on. I didn't love the traveling so much. But from a poker business position, we should have just kept going. We just should have kept going and worked as hard as before. And then we could expect to keep crushing. But putting less work in is not working. Same thing like if I make S&E and play poker 24 seven, I think I crush in the same way when like doing vacation left and right, and then playing for two days, that is not working. Deep into more, a very good point, others kept progressing relatively more now on the curve, absolutely. Maybe we had an advantage standing still, they kept working when they overtake us or they just caught up, who knows? Yeah you want to keep crushing though no comes at a cost right it's like really this is then the personal decision but now here we're talking about poker career as like a business decision if you want to spend more time with friends family do vacations that's good for you right or yeah good for me in that case but yeah it's like you can't have the same expectations right then maybe some player i have the biggest respect for actually that i've seen at the top and then they played online again and they didn't start from the bottom but they didn't play the highest stakes there are some people who always sign up for the highest stakes because they played that at some point i mean when i got back into cash i needed that confidence again and i started an l zoom 200 where i wanted to build a nice graph and I was lucky to do so but yeah just I needed that maybe it was not the best hourly rate or business decision but I needed it personally because I didn't have that confidence like okay I didn't play really cash for three years I cannot expect to be way better than everyone they are all right let's get to number two and this relates a little to number I didn't know how to split them up because it's like one big pattern that follows me where like yeah it's like sticking to what i knew it's like really that it's kind of the same you know i hated leaving my comfort zone maybe a little story i can tell there is i loved my supernova elite grind i mean i was stuck in brighton i didn't like it there but i loved sitting on my computer and grinding. I loved playing and I was maybe a little scared of new stuff. Like we said, the scripting maybe or playing higher stakes like new players where it's more like three other very good guys and a big recreational. I enjoyed playing weaker wrecks that play a Zoom 500 just for rakeback every day. And you're like okay this guy is just break even. So against me he loses like three to four big blinds we're like yeah small money but i knew exactly where the leaks are and i enjoyed that just pretty much winning i don't know maybe 20 out of 30 days in the month like not 50 50 something like that with long sessions lots of value low variance where yeah i wasn't ready like to just play higher like i had big respect for people playing there and maybe underestimated myself there even right where i could have easily played nl5k if you started today how would you approach i would define a goal what do you want to reach with poker first you need to love the game okay but then it's your goal to play it sometimes what's the time you can put in and then you can have a plan i would now if i have the plan to reach what i reached now again would be like more of the fedor style incredibly aggressive bankroll management in the way that i want to play with better players as fast as possible because this accelerates your getting better just makes you so much better so much faster and everything else whether you have like a $10 hourly or like a $15 hourly on nl10 who cares in a year like no one no one cares early on you mentioned paul otto was what was so special about him that he created so many poker beasts he is very very sharp in poker theory and he is a very very very very good teacher so he can explain things I think I can explain things well but maybe with poker theory he can do it better alright so getting back to that not leaving comfort zone scared of new stuff where really the big example is like how stupid is it to just play zoom 500 and 200 for ages like so many hours instead of thinking about okay how can I increase really my hourly instead of just adding tables relying on the action? That is there good old times in November December when everyone was chasing SNE But yeah, the story I wanted to get to actually is when they killed SNE. I had a problem They just killed my job I have for everyone who's new to poker and not like 10 years old in it Poker stars had a great breakback system that was very very good for people putting lots of volume in and they killed that and now it was not that interesting because it not only took my rakeback away or made it way worse but it also killed the games because those games ran all the time because of all the rakeback grinders and it's way more interesting for a recreational to jump in a very very full pool of zoom 500. I you see it nowadays it's almost never running it was not that bad back in the days but it was very different so they killed my games in a way with that decision as well and yeah then i had a one friend i got to know a little earlier who was pushing me already for a while to play those live high rollers where like you can see with everything i told you that this was not really what i wanted to do it's like yeah but they play that forever and like live it's very different and i was like no confidence and so on and then i started playing sit and goes first to kind of prepare for that a little and i realized okay in those lots of stages where i know exactly what's going on they were really shit and then finally this guy's name is by the way Fedor Holtz and then he got me to try my first bigger buy-in, play some live and then they caught me. What was the reason they killed it? They figured out that they don't need the grinders that much so why give them so much money? It's not greed it's just a business decision. Their business is making money and they were giving away money to players that well they didn't have benefit in so it was a very good business decision i would say the way they did it was very very bad and i still think they stole money from us because yeah the supernova elite system worked that you get rewards in the next years like your rakeback next year gets better and this is what is written down and this is what they took away so i grinded one year to expect in the next year to have way better rate back there counted that in pretty much in my decision and then they took it away which i think is not okay like i think their business decision to take it away is absolutely correct let's be honest right but the way they did it and took away from like something for me they had like a contract with that breakback system with me in a way and just like took something away that was just not okay and i mean like they got lots of for it which i think actually hurt them all right so that's the next thing that like it took me a lot of lot of time like fedor was winning lots of those high rolls already before i even thought about jumping in and he really pushed for like those fields are so great i remember i was in skiing vacation and he was winning like a manila event where we looked it up like for day two 10 15 players left three stacks that were worth like 200k didn't show up because they were like short stacked like asian names i've never seen before like okay this is really giving money away all right don't you think they kind of killed the american dream folk a bit with that decision not necessarily it's a little more about game selection it can't change the games running like yeah they killed lots of games that you can just play with everyone for pretty much a cheap price all right let's get to the number one and the number one i put in this is the reason why I started with the whole on off and around the table today to explain that i call just my biggest league still today and i'm super happy with it is around the table i love playing i love theory i hated everything else i talked about affiliating i talked about game selection at times i rather added a zoom 200 table to play that like as the I don't know eighth table on the side With probably like a two to five big blind win rate instead of waiting and looking for like a good high stakes table because like Observing lobbies is the worst you can do to me like I hate it rather I click something that I'm not making money with it feels like I love doing theory you can ask me anything I can work on anything love it actually but i hate the other stuff working with affiliates rakeback it's people asking you can you play here and this and so on mixing sites it's so annoying scripting i never did it in my freaking life like yeah there are some people who illegally script on gg and we try to point them out to the team there because there are some big recreationals and somehow always the same people get the Jesus seed no one can click that fast every time and they take all the money obviously right like big blind per hundred are not just on the table they are dependent on the seed if you have the Jesus seed on a very big VIP this is where the money is so this makes you a lot of money for actually putting the same effort in later this for example you can talk about something like live games this is why I like the tournaments there I would never ever play live in the Bellagio the way the tipping system works you give those floor men like 100 bucks here 100 bucks there that they put you in the best spots it's like an absolute shit show and I don't enjoy it at all i want to show up compete with everyone this is what the tournaments do like i'm not even talking about private games where like you maybe talk nicely to some vips make a show i don't know some people are like great actors to get into those games where i'm like no really not i don't enjoy it all. Where like, I think like that with my skill level and theory and execution, what I could do on the poker table, if I worked more around the table, I could have made a very different amount of money. So again, this is my personal decision that I hate that, but as a business decision, I should have put way more effort into that. I probably just even in rakeback missed so much because I didn't click on that link instead of the other one or something. Stuff like that is a top five mistake for myself in my poker career business wise. But I don't regret it for a second. Maybe the script thing at good times when it was allowed. Yeah, the lobby grind is indeed the most soul crushing part of like just sitting there having the GG lobby open and trying to snap click in a second. Did you ever have any issue adjusting from Zoom to Rectables? I've played a lot of Zoom, wanted to switch to Rectables, but the pace is so slow. That's it. My problem is that I start YouTube videos on the side because I'm so freaking bored. So what I tried and what helped a lot is that I forced myself to follow the hands and I had certain rules how many notes I take even. I put my focus, I wanted to keep it in poker but the poker was way too slow for me, I put it in note taking that I don't even open some other stuff. This was my list top five. Before getting to the key takeaways I have one add-on mistake. Actually this one I partly regret. Most tournaments I did not ask Fedoror for a swap like everyone thinks like there are so many swaps and so on and there are many swaps but i didn't have really fedor swaps he obviously bought lots of my action anyways and his market price was just way higher with his kind of fame after a while he could sell with huge markup it's like asking him for money it's like asking him for a friendly favor But in reality, it's like he could just sell my action. I make up numbers Let's say for 1.1 He could buy my action for 1.1 and he could sell his action for let's say 1.2 to make up numbers So why should he ever swap instead of selling his and then buying mine just cheaper? Just that I get action from him be like the friendly deal like that's the good thing i don't need financial interest in like rooting for others and cheering for them so this this is very good but from like a business perspective i could have made a lot of money there but yeah that's a little add-on mistake that's kind of a fun one but that's okay as well and now again coming to the key takeaways what was that coaching for talking a lot about like random stories for my poker career, obviously. But the main point is that you are finding spots to improve your poker self. So here really coming back to the on, off and around the table, to the FIFA rating system, right? We can improve in very different areas of poker, not only poker three. I want you to know that. Maybe you're just a moneymaker and you actually don't enjoy poker. That's cool as well, right? Or you play like certain home games and you try to get invited to the best, right? Then around the table is your deal, right? Getting invited to the good games, playing the right tables. And that's absolutely cool, getting the best breakback deal. Or, you know, like, okay, your poker theory is cool, but your execution kind of sucks think about i don't know how you can change that right someone said like ausgleich in german before like just having something else that helps like i always i feel so bad when i don't do like sports at least once a week like back then it was like more like five times a week i needed it to like be ready my poker game as well, to eat somewhat healthy. I didn't do that really in Brighton, but I did it actually when I was playing live. Like the lunch I had before tournaments was always something like very healthy because you can feel it. If it's not like okay what I ate for the dinners, let's not talk about it. But you know what I mean, right? Something like that, right right it's like for maybe the execution on the table some lots of tournament players actually smoke lots of weed when they are playing tournaments like i think they care less and it's not hurting their poker game in a way right maybe it's even better that they care less and feel whatever right it's like i'm not experienced here but you see like the point right some people drink i might do that as well maybe it helps my game maybe sometimes not that's up to you so you've seen here that actually my biggest and most costly mistakes weren't really in the playing part of the game i mean obviously i couldn't know in 2012 what right poker theory is but i tried my best and i'm super happy with what i did there right for back in the times maybe one thing that i forget to mention for like the sticking to what I knew I was very bad with adapting to new software I had very very early solvers access like Pio was very new I had a study group that started like someone wanted to introduce Pio to us he even was out of a business that does something similar so he was like into solver programming something like that and he explained to us and i was just like i didn't understand how powerful it is i understood that the way we used it was stupid like we were starting with looking at four bad pots and took like the given preflop ranges that no one played like that and was like okay what we see here is for our game but what we can learn from that or how that tells us how to adjust i didn't see so i had big chances there i didn't so maybe that was another part of that sticking to what i know system and yeah then your personal goals are very important here they should lead your way and this is now to answer again the question how i would start over again or what is my advice for someone starting over is knowing that your personal goals should lead your way how you treat your little poker business is it a small business is it a big business is it a side business this is what it should be about coaching part I think is over here feel free to ask little more questions I'll be around here because what I want to do is the which player are you quiz alright so you open ace five of clubs in middle position and got re-raised to six big blinds by the cutoff. So middle versus cutoff with a stack of 35 blinds, your first intuition is to fold. We're definitely ruling that out. Call or move all in. I'm more in the calling camp. I like my low pockets and suited kings a little more. Not necessarily because I know like pie or charts charts i think ace five suited will be indifferent anyways but i know that people like still these days especially life like three betting offsuit aces too much so i prefer my king x over my ace x for blockers so i'm going to call what's the optimal amount of time for playing poker per day depends on my other personal stuff i like playing poker so it can be a lot but if it's sunny outside yeah prefer being there doing something with with my son and so on so it's there's no number. Right now it's like I like to get one session in like a two to three hour session and I'm happy with it or like two 90-minute sessions let's say. You defended Queen Jack in the big blind against a button race you called twice on Queen 10-7 with a flush draw four rainbow on ace of diamonds offsuit ace river your opponent bets 80 pot they don't tell me how big they bet before i would really give a lot on the bet sizing on flop and turn here just expect small bet on the flop over bet on the turn and now 80 pot on the river seems weird on that card you have four times the pot behind and your first intuition is to actually my first intuition is to jam most of the time overrule it because people don't believe me that i have lots of king jack here this depends on the turn sizing though a lot but the first instinct first intuition is actually move all in and i see that is it a chance like i don't think about call first i will end up folding most of the time but this is the first intuition and you're cruising through to day two of the wsop main event as the table chip leader a player known for his hyper aggressive playing style sits down to your left and he covers you what describes your gameplay i don't let others how i play my normal game no it's war be ready for some firsts i obviously i will put different i will change my strategy but tight starting off tight is more right actually i see this as the only correct option if someone's way too wild your weakest opens just get minus cv now and everything else gains cv so this is correct but I will tight in the open raising sense but I will then go to war once I'm there so there are different ways to make money in the game which one fits best best? Wait for strong hands and get paid? I like that. Fundamentally solid strategy. That's like a bullshit answer. Being aggressive and winning lots of small pots. Actually where I'm playing right now this is the case. I opened Queens on the button and made two decent sized value bets on 8-7-3 deuce against the big blind on a king river. Offsuit king 1.5 times pot. Let's freaking rip it. I 10 of suited why am i not three betting against the cutoff probably weird stack size here like seems like 100 three bet in my games just to fall out king 10 king jack offsuit and so on but i called my flush draw versus a continuation bet because i'm freaking nit and i wasn't check raising okay they tell me so much so much what I should do. On a three of diamond turn your opponent bets 75% of the pot. I fold that. Player in early position opened, cut off and button both call. You also call in the big blind with king four of clubs. Everyone has around 40 big blinds on a flop. King nine three with a flush draw checks to the button who fires a third pot bet. My first intuition is actually I like raising a lot and not calling too much being capped call is fine but actually i like very tiny raises here you're playing an early level of an ept main event with 120 big blinds effective stacks low jack opens 2.5x you three bet to 8.5x in the cutoff after a short thought the unknown regular and the low jack four bets to 24 now i don't want to jam in that spot but i'm mainly calling see what he does where can i send my okay stefan is my name stefan at pokercode.com should be an existing email i agree to everything obviously more aggressive than last time that was the queen jack jam last time i was daniel but i there i actually followed the queen jack but i didn't read read the question as like first intuition and I read it more as like what would you do. Alright so I want you all to participate in that quiz we want to have some more results there. That was it from my side I hope you enjoyed it there is a home game right now coaching is uploaded we have the poker personality quiz I think I promoted everything that worked well alright right so yeah have a great one and see you for the next coaching for the poker code members so see you in the poker code discord and for everyone who doesn't have the money right now to subscribe we have the free account option as well then you have like some limited access and see some of my videos lots of fedor's videos and so on all right have a good one guys
