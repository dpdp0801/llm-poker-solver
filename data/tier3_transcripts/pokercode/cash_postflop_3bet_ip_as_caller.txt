### TOPIC: cash postflop 3bet ip as caller
 Let's talk about three bad pots in position as the caller. It is us. It is hero who open raises early position, middle position, cutoff, or the button. I treat those all kind of the same. Obviously ranges will be different, but like the spot itself is the same. And then we have the small blind or the big blind three betting. The spot is so huge because we play the whole game tree. It's just a three bad pot from one side that I cannot cover that today. I'm focusing on one or two main decision points, but this is the spot. Obviously it's a big difference whether it's the small blind three betting or the big blind three betting. Lots of the hand history discussions we have in Discord, I focus a lot on like big blind always being too value heavy and so on, something to keep in mind on the exploitative level. This is a huge difference. And obviously ranges are quite different as well. Let's say we are on the button with king jack offsuit and the small blind three bets us right the king jack offsuit is like a kind of a bad call just thinking about the small blind having 100 of ace jacks and king queen offsuits dominating us while the big blind is mainly flatting those hands and just sometimes three betting against the big blinds the way better better three bet, right? This is where we can start things. We won't go that much into detail, but just to give you one example where things are a little different. And now what happened is we didn't four bet, we didn't fold, we call, we are sitting in position and see a flop. This is what we are going to discuss today. A little timeline for today. We'll talk about in general, what do I think about that spot? What is important to focus on? We'll talk a little about the flop, especially. We'll talk a little about the term, especially. And I'll give a couple of examples. I need to work with examples because the spot is way too big. And then instead of having a quiz, because I didn't find time to prepare that in circumstances, I will just play a little GTO wizard drill myself while explaining my thoughts there. Hello, to what extent is it applicable to DeepStacktt it is absolutely applicable to deep stack mtt as long as we are actually just playing three streets really instead of having those like 40 big blind three bad pot game changes a lot when you keep your option open to bet like the flop big and jam lots of turns we have way more raising in tournaments there to just get an equity but yeah let's just say like 80 big blinds plus and then ranges are not different it's just played with anti and yeah probably the cash gamers just play that spot better because they just know it more but what i'm talking about today more general stuff how to attack which sizings to choose what to stab what not to stab is very very. Yeah, let's start with general stuff. I just thought about that. Let's start with general stuff. Obviously, something I can write down every spot is ranges and the boards dictate our strategy. It's like nothing happened. We should know our range, which is very, very, very important. Know how often you have pocket fives. Know how often you have pocket sevens. It's less important what the number is. It's important that you know what you did before. This is very, very important. For example, I've arranged where let's say button versus small blind. I call fives plus every single time against the normal size three bet. Deuces until fours, I only call 50% of the time. I know it. That is important. This is what I mean with that. How good do you hit your board? Not a random solver that plays different than you. No, how often do you hit that? If you're an unexperienced player, you might want to be a little tighter, right? You're just like you rather overfall to not get into too much trouble, but then you know your range. Let's say you've just fold six as minus, then you know that if there is a board containing a seven, an eight, and a nine, that's your board. If it's three, four, five, you actually don't have anything, right? So this is very, very important. The second thing is just what do we focus on? What should we really focus on when it's on us, when we make sizings, when we need to make decisions? And this is usually villain's weakest part. And this year is two big exclamation marks with equity, right? So thinking about what is villain's weakest part that I actually want to attack, this will tell us the sizings we want to use, right? One of our examples today will be a board of 6-5-4, and villain will need to check a lot on this board to us. So if it's 6-5-4, 6 of spades, 5 of clubs, 4 of hearts, what am I thinking about? I'm thinking about villain's give-ups like queen-jack and king-jack of diamonds. Those have equity against all my pocket peers. They even hitting a top peer, they can think about going for stacks depending on the situation. So absolutely important that we attack those. On the other hand, if the board is something like ace of hearts, king of hearts, queen of hearts, villains weakest part is probably something like six, seven of spades, but it's nothing that has equity against our range. So I don't care about that, right? I'm rather thinking about villains, let's say King Jack maybe, or a weak ace without flush draw, or maybe pocket nines having the flush card. I like something like that. The weakest part that has equity against our range. This is something just to start with a general thought that helps you a lot. All right. Now, third point is going a little deeper into the game tree because to have that, we need villain to do something, right? I'm not talking about the pre-flop range here. Deep stack should never be like totally polarized. Maybe a big blind three betting is a little more polarized, but out of position with three streets to play, you need strong hands, right? The bluffs are something like jack nine suited, which is not like air or anything. It means, did villain range bet the flop, for example, still has his whole range, including mid pairs, top pairs, over pairs, full garbage that wouldn't be polarized, that would be a linear range, or did he split on the flop? Did he say like seven deuce-deuce, naming the example again? I go big right away. I want to stack pocket pairs. I do that do that with pocket tens plus and with my bluffs that might be random overcards then he's clearly polarized and this is something to keep in mind if we think about how to attack things later what does it mean if villain starts checking a three on the turn seven deuce deuce three his range is polarized so he either has something to stack off or again he has something queen jack. So maybe we should find the right sweet spot there to attack his king jack instead of wasting money, betting big as a bluff, for example, and then just facing his check jam of the over pair. Definitely something to keep in mind. What was the action that happened? Because this will tell you what you are exactly attacking. So now what you hopefully figured out already is point number four what i did so far three bad pots are about tight ranges this is not where i want to talk about too much general things like he's weak here he is strong here is whatever no it is that tight that we can start talking about hands and combinations like i can bet my jack 10 now because i make I make his King-Jack fold. This is perfectly fine. Folding out a dominated hand. I can do this because he calls those combinations. Often when we focus on offsuit hands even, right? Villain probably in some spots only has Ace-King and Ace-Queen offsuit. So this will be lots of combinations, right? Knowing how to play against those or that he's capable of bluffing those will tell you your whole strategy of making certain hands call making certain hands fall right villain has the flush draws he check calls them on the turn mid pier plus flush draw and he check falls them on the river this might be a great reason if we unblock them to bluff jam a river something like that so again it's the in general slide we want to think about it in combinations not counting the combinations that would be next level, but I'm not doing that in game. Like someone is scared of that, right? But really naming what we are targeting. What do we want to make Will unfold? Not we bet here because we want to fold something. No, I want him to fold this combination and this combination. I want him to call this and that. I know my range here, and we'll get to that on the turn a little later, where I know what my range is. I know what the bottom of my range is. I know what I'm value betting, and I can add exactly that amount of bluffs because those are my weakest hands, for example. 3-bet pots are about being precise. Lots of people love that. I love that. Some people hate it because they just want to do whatever and find excuses for everything, which I can find you so many excuses for any hand we would play in like a single race pot. Like I can make up things and just argue for myself. This is tough in a three bet pot, right? A mess up in a three bet pot is a mess up. No way around it. So this to keep in mind in general, this will pretty much be the same slide as the key takeaways actually once we talked about some examples. All right, brings us to the happens on the flop mainly we are sitting in position so that means villain is first to act if villain bats we are caught in the reaction game and this is where we start thinking about okay what is happening it's not like we call or look at our hand or we don't it's like yes this will be lots of passive calling game and some folding there There are some boards where we want to have a raising range. On lots of boards, we can simplify and not play with one. On other boards, it's a great exploit. Feel free to share your notes here, to write stuff down. There are some great looms in the cash strategy that OMG Kaihudi did, especially for raising c-bets and three-bet pots as an exploit. That fits in perfectly here. I know it's somewhere hidden in the cash strategy, but someone of you finds it, and please post it there. That would help a lot if you want to dive deeper because he did such great content on that. I skipped that part here and save time to not talk about raises here and talk about continuation in a passive way to see turns. So main thing is really keep it in our mind, which bet size did we call? Often I have actually students that forgot the bet size when they are on the turn. They're just like, what does it mean? Oh, why did he bet small on nine deuce deuce? Shouldn't even exist if we know that, right? It's like, what could it mean? Is it just ace king? Is it ace queen? Keeping hands in? Is it, I don't know, the super nuts like pocket nines, not wanting to fold out anything? Or is it just like he bombs it and probably just represents tens and jacks and trash? It's like, we don't know, but it helps us to make good strategies on the turn when we get there. All right. So now second thing that can happen on the flop is that villain checks. That means we need to build a betting range, which brings us back to the question, how do we attack villain best? And this brings us back to the general part, which was number two here. We want to focus on villain's weakest part that has equity versus our range. I just simmed something in Pyro for you guys. That's the first example board. Nevermind, I kind of killed it, but we'll just take GTO wizard instead because they have it forever so the board i want to look at is the open raise the button the big blind three bets kind of large we call and the flop is six five four i think i mentioned that before already where we can see yeah out of position can do some small betting there's not really a hand that is really interested in betting, like maybe six, five, a few pocket sixes, you should have lots of checking. And then this is the sizing choices we want to take here, right? So we have all in option, very large option. We have a like almost pot bet option. We have the half pot option, third pot and like 20%. So the 20% is actually the favorable one, right? It's like like on the one hand we want to keep weekends in if we have a set on the other hand we want to deny equity when we have something like pocket sevens pocket eights pocket nines fold out villain what happens always good to see the reaction we fall out queen 10 queen jack king jack king 10 king 9 and like those here without the backdoor. So something that is very, very effective. We force VLN to build a check raising range. Now, exploitative level, people are probably not check raising enough on lower stakes. They bet in the first place. So I think on lower stakes, we get away with way more betting here. We have a clear plan, right? That would be a very, very clear one where we want to use a small sizing, whether you mix it into 20% and 33, or it just take like 25 for everything. I prefer the last one, right? That doesn't matter to me. This is okay. Pretty clear. We want to target certain hand category. We know this hand category falls, and then we are on the turn. Perfect. Let's have a look for something else here. Another board that could get checked a lot. Jack 9 eight is probably not getting checked a lot. Well, I'm still 50%. All right. So Jack nine eight, let's see what is different here. What do we want to attack here? All this offsuit stuff somehow connects. We can obviously connect a few offsuit aces that are here to fall out. Are we really interested in that? I would guess that there's just less betting of the 20% And it's way more of a shift towards the 33 or even some half pot here, right? So now versus the check, I'm totally wrong. And it's apparently just the 20%. I should have double checked on that. But we see, again, we are attacking something. And it seems like the ace highs and those king highs, if they exist, are the ones that actually, okay, 20% attacks the ace king. That's kind of blowing my mind blowing my mind the ace king can fold already all right so maybe one where we are only stepping small betting small is a good idea to start with is something like this here ace king four villain is betting a lot in the first place but if he is checking we can bet a lot here if we use smaller sizes even but if he is checking he's like queens jacks tense king, Tens, King-X, King-X, King-X, weaker Ace-X. Well, PIO is protecting itself with Aces and Kings. So it's like, we cannot go crazy, but it won't be the 20% sizing this time, right? So 20%, 7%. If we calculate that longer, that won't really exist. It's more like the third pot and then up to half pot. We see the first 11% here, which makes a lot of sense, right? Something like PocketForce wants to get the money in now instead of like seeing a queen, jack, everything there has equity against it. So just as like a general idea, but you see it's more of the do we want to bet or not decision that is interesting besides whether we have some bigger sizings or some smaller sizings that will be more interesting later. Because is that the case because nothing happened so far villain didn't polarize villain didn't do anything villain has still a large range that is protected and can react to any sizing this is why huge sizings are always forbidden as long as villain is protected huge sizings just do not exist and we start off small whether it's more very small or a little between like more 30 to 50%. That depends on the structure. But actually doing that wrong doesn't cost you any. That's just something to start with. The flop is always not the key moment, right? Not the key moment. It's a preparation for the turn. It's more about you knowing what's going on instead of nailing something you haven't piled here. Yeah, I think that brings us to the turn. The turn is the main interesting decision point I want to discuss today. So the flop, kind of everything is fine as long as we play somewhat reasonable with sizings. And the turn is the main decision point, especially when something happened before. And then the river is getting so specific because we need an action on the flop. We need a turn card, an action on the turn. We need a river card. We need a river strategy. It doesn't make sense to talk in general about it. Lots of examples will bring us to that. But the turn is the main decision point where I can kind of present a strategy that is just working out or is kind of representing what's going on there. So this is what I wrote down here. Like obviously if villain just keeps firing, we are caught in the reaction game. I didn't even write that down because it's not an interesting decision point we have our calls that we need to make and we have our faults we need to make and on some words we have races which will mainly be a jam that just happens and is kind of one special category that well would be cool for another coaching but would be too big for today i'm just mentioning it to not leave it? The turn versus double barrel, what we want to jam depends a lot on villain's capability of double barreling. And then it's a certain hand category that just does better than with jamming than with calling. And the main spot is this one here that villain did bet the flop and checks to us. Now, this is what happens a lot. I think people are c-betting a lot. And then on the they have to actually split their range and check to us and that means something. Remember we kept in our mind what the flop strategy was, whether villain did polarize or not. And now on the turn we mainly have two different strategies. Are we building a polarized betting strategy, which is already here, point number three, or do we need those small equity denial bets to just fold out villains give ups? The answer is usually, well, if he has lots of give ups and they have equity against us, we want to have that small bet. If villain is kind of just giving up, it has not much equity. We don't need to deny that equity, right? So we build something going directional. And I try to represent pretty much the whole, the big picture in paint. and I'm sorry for everyone who is here for the first time I guess most of the people know my paint games already and how I see and think in poker like just how I represent that but you will find into that don't worry I prepared a little something so now what we have here and I explain it step by step the step. The red color just meaning villain bets, right? So red is villain, obviously, and green is zero. Okay, so this is how the spot usually plays out. I split that up into like six kind of game trees that are happening. And let's start with the easiest one. So villain starts by betting small. That could be like a small range bet on ace king four. And then he's checking to us on the turn, right? Every line kind of stands for next bet that is coming. This could be a race, but it's not here. So here it's like a small flop bet. And then it's kind of two same size arrows with a green color. That means we are betting a linear way turn and river. Big bet on the turn, big bet on the river, right? Big arrow represents big bet. Small arrow represents small bet. Thank you. color. That means we are betting a linear way turn and river. Big bet on the turn, big bet on the river, right? Big arrow represents big bet. Small arrow represents small bet. So this is one strategy that is happening, right? It could be ace, king, four. Turn is a deuce. We have deuces or ace, queen or ace, king. We bet big on the turn. We bet big on the river. We don't need equity denial. Small bets, easy. The other thing would be something like villain is betting small. We now bet small on the turn. Like this is something special already, I feel like. And then we have still two options on the river. We can bet none all in with a normal sizing, right? After two small bets, it's like our river jam will be an overbet. Or we can obviously still overbet. That could be something like, I don't know, if villain, for example for example bet small on the board you should bet big on whatever that means right and then we are stabbing small or like there's a flush coming the villain is more protected that could be something and then we keep everything in and then only polarized to flushes and blockers for example right another type of strategy then strategy or game tree c and d are representing a big bet from villain to start with and this year is something like he bets big on seven deuce deuce turn is then a three and we decide to step small against his give ups and then like seven deuce deuce three we have ace three we are betting now river is a king we better check back or the same with pocket tens river is a five and we obviously value jam now right but we are not going like same size same size like relative to the pot right not 75 75 we do like a 25 step here and then go crazy a little later or we face a big bet of villain and then go big big right that could be something like seven deuce deuce and now villain is checking, right? Checking on a king, his best card in the deck, just clearly meaning he's probably sitting on solid shoulder value that doesn't beat a king. So we want to attack that with like linear sizing, if we can beat that and add some bluffs. So this would be another strategy here. And in the end, it will often be a mix, right? If you now think about like a pile solver thing, or like a GTO wizard thing, you see lots of mixes. And actually this is just combining those two strategies from the turn on, right? Obviously on the flop, the same thing happened. The combination of those two things were now splitting that up in your head can help you understand those strategies and help you to understand what fits in where. What I just added is the two strategy if villain checks flop. Do we start linear or do we start small and then start polarizing on the turn just to have the full picture? Now I want to give you a couple of examples and even ask you which strategies apply here. I'm only interested in going directional in now. Obviously we can check. There are way more game trees like check raising including, or we check back would be another one, right? I'm interested in the hands that want to build a pot. The other is like, would be too much for now. Let's have a look at some of the Pio Sims here, right? So I did something. I forced villain. Let's take the ace king four here. Ace king four, what I did was out of position. I forced villain to just bet quarter pot and not offer anything else, which means he will bet almost full range quarter pot. This is not what the solver does. It's samey-wee pretty much. And this is why lots of people are playing that simplified strategy. You sit there in position with all the pocket pairs. You hate to see it. You have to mix fold here. You have that. You can play with a raising range that is pretty much pocket force, the only hand that clearly wants to raise, or you can leave it. Actually, just also so now what happens is villain is merged important we wanted to talk about the flop and remember how villain is playing right so we know that for lots of people you probably just put out a range bet we call with whatever we want to continue we have ace x we have king x we have draws with some of the peers and turn is let's say a brick whatever here, but let's take the deuce of hearts. And our villain can have multiple strategies here. Out of position, always way more mixing than in position. This time he's checking, and now it's on us. And now my question is, which strategy are we talking about? A, B, C, D, E, or F. What's our preferred strategy? Villain range bets flop, and now it's on us on the turn. Which strategy is the relevant one here we are choosing a a or b a a a a so we have a pretty clear e we have daniel and the geo going for b here b is a clear mistake i mean we always find some traces of stuff in pio but if we check the turn you see like is there a small betting and again remember we want to attack villains weakest part that has equity what are you attacking with betting small on the turn but it sits there with the king says nice thank you for the cheap price i call villain sits there with an ace thank you for the cheap price i call the small bet is like okay i fold my seven eight of diamonds it's like okay it doesn't have any equity anyways so it's something small that doesn't make sense right so it's more we want to polarize we want to give trouble to villains weakest hands with equity like we want to give him trouble with his king x with his weak ace x and this is why we actually start with ace jack ace queen 100 this is bluff additions we have the sets and now very important to see that will be in the key takeaways it's like knowing your range knowing what your weakest hands are and they need to bluff and this is what we start with here this is pocket threes pocket fives four five is bluffing with a peer very often obviously five six pocket six is bluffing pocket seven is bluffing and the more knowledge you gain about that you will see in game what people are not doing you will see those hands. And then you know, okay, those people have to be under bluffing. Maybe people are going too crazy with those gut shots. They are a little more natural, but they block everything that you want to fold. So it's like, yeah. So we have the clear thing, linear plan now. Boom, we bet big. Villain sits there with king, queen hates his life, with pierce hates his life. This is an achievement, right? And now let's say the river is another brick tough to find a brick but we'll take a six port now our bluff our pocket six has got there and we jam something like ace jack plus villain hates his life now with the weak aces or it's like indifferent with all of them so yeah very very nice and effective way this was strategy a now let's just close that we don't need ace king four take another board. Seven deuce deuce. First of all, let's have a look at the flop strategy. I offer two sizings, a small one and a big one. It only takes the big one. Seven deuce deuce is like a brick board. Actually, what are we? Big blind versus button I chose. It's a polarized strategy. Willem did bet big. You can see in the background, I think I can actually open both. You see in the background here, okay talking about strategy c or d and now we call that right we call that with some raises like pocket eights okay we call that mainly and then the turn can be a brick let's say turn is a three what's your sizing plan if willem checks to you is it c or is it d okay different question if i force you to take one hand to bet big obviously c is right so if i force you to play strategy d with one hand in your range you see your calling range here which one would it be right so we see the same pattern right nuts right now but not on lots of river cards right this is correct and this will bring us to lots of mixes so now the turn is a offsuit three villain needs to give up lots of his bluffs right he had all those over cards lots of them have to give up and now this is our reaction right so obviously there's no big betting whatsoever but like if we see traces the first something would be like tens and nines it's actually pocket queens not because they don't need to protect that much just like nines tens they need more protection but we are small only and then it's like that clear game tree number c we go small wait to see a river or face the check jam right wait to see a river river let's say another brick and now well any peer seems to be good enough we can actually jam all the ace highs because villain is pretty much having ace high only we move him off the split split. That's pretty sweet. So let's not take the three then. Let's take the four. And then we can take any peer and even ace king, right? And bluff all those king highs. It's like kind of crazy how that plays out. But this was clear game tree number C. That's enough of seven deuce deuce. Let's take another board. This board here. This time we play small blind versus hijack on queen 8-5. Again, I offered a 25% bet and like a 60% bet. Something biggish. Clearly preferred is the bigger bet, right? Attack nines, tens, six. They all have some backdoors going on for them. So in position is just easily clicking on call. So we want to take the bigger bet to target villain a little, right? If we put that into GTO wizard, we have a big mix of everything because every hand has like some incentives i prefer to simplify things a little like that big bet makes a lot of sense no reason to race here whatsoever every hand that is nutted now will be nutted on every turn so no reason to race so clearly call only we are again talking about c and about d now i've asked differently what turn card do I need to put there that we follow game tree number D? High card, high card. Okay. Let's just double check. Ace of hearts. Okay. Villain is almost betting range. So this is kind of a cheat because we won't get into that game tree, right? Villain is sitting on tens only. If he checks, actually we use small bets. You lose. High cards lose. Next choice. Villain is betting big because he always has something. Look at what he's betting. He's betting big, but he is not polarized. So this is kind of a trick question, guys. He's betting big, but he is range betting. So he is not polarized. He has all the middle stuff. It's the same he did like on ace-king-4 with a small bet. So let's say we put a brick out there. Villain is still sitting on jacks, on tens, on nines. How do we want to attack those? Definitely not with a small sizing. So actually we need a brick that we go for that game tree here, right? So villain bets big, full range pretty much. Turn is a freaking deuce. He needs to give up like king-jack, king-ten, ace-ten, ace-jack. But in this spot, he doesn't have that much equity, right? Because we don't have those small pockets. We are dominating him. We have ace king or we have peers going on here, right? So it's not that we need that small protection bet. We have that deuce of hearts. Villain checks to us, like, what is his checking range this year? This is dead to us. This had like maximum three outs, never six, and never that it can really value bet those. It's more like nines, tens, jacks, weakish queen, x, and how we attack those is pretty clear. So we see obviously kind of a mix here. We see 15% small, but this would disappear if I keep running it longer. 10s, jacks, they don't actually want to bet here. Pocket 8s are the first one that can bet small to keep everything in. Yeah, makes absolutely sense if Willem does not use that small bet to just keep his range going, what he does on that king or ace is just range betting again, because it's such a favorable card for him. And then he's actually not splitting his range on the turn, really. And we've seen that actually pocket tens are the only hand that wants to do that. Right? So actually here, it's kind of a trick play that he is betting big, but he's not polarized on the flop. He has everything. And then how do we attack jacks, jacks tens nines on the turn and weak queen x is pretty clear with a big sizing so now thinking about that because i obviously chose kind of special boards and this is the first one where we see this mix right and i just want to show you how that mix is built here the big betting range is just everything that can go for value and bluffs that go accordingly like we have king queen suited ace queen ace queen king queen is kind of the line ace king just looks the same makes a lot of sense unblocks jacks tens nines has equity against that has full equity against that right pretty cool 125 nines tens hate their life jacks is an indifferent catcher blocking queen jacks likely good okay i mean this we can fold that in game against pretty much anyone again what goes into our bluffing range is well some of the gut shots some of the lowest peers again they are two outers and yeah that's pretty cool the small bat is actually well the set of eights that want to keep everything in somehow and then this mix of like thinnest value that don't want to check back and see a card like tens slightly benefiting from folding out king jack ace jack but not really wanting to put that bet out there if i keep that running longer that bet would disappear this is just what we see here because it's just very low frequency and not really winning EV. It's kind of more a clearly polarized structure. But we will see board squirts a little different. Now different question. Which turn card do I need to put here that we go for game tree number C? Who's brave enough? I need a turn card to go for C. Mid card, nine, 10, jack, queen, queen, eight. Okay, so we either want to improve, but we improve both sides or we want to pair the board. Let's have a look. I know one of them is correct. The other one, I'm not sure. It could be true also. So I know definitely that the queen is correct, right? Because then villain has just so many of those kind of king jack hands and he needs to check way more because well he didn't improve at all and we kind of improved because we have all the queen eggs feeding now these kings aces so now let's first check what happens if the turn is a nine we'll need to check a lot and i think it will be a huge mix of sizes this year clearly a huge huge, huge, huge, huge mix. Let's have a look at the queen. On the queen, Villain does not keep betting with tens and jacks. That's just slightly too weak. Could be in position, but out of position with one more to go. And if he checks, a clear mix as well, slightly favored towards the small sizing. We see clearly what's the goal here, right? We have that clear equity denial bet, like 7-6 folding out King-Jack, perfect, right? Pocket 10s folding out Ace-Jack, perfect. Queen-10, not really sure whether it can stack off. First, see whether Will only calls or raises. Betting small in the first place. King-Queen, Ace-Queen, not much happening now Now get max money now before there's more stuff happening. It's that. So we have our pattern already in those mixes, what we want to do, right? So it is here usually a mix. This is our main part, our main decision point. This year is what we usually put in there. Involvable nuts and in bets, check back river, right? And here it's more like vulnerable nuts and air in that here is like, obviously there's air as well, but this is more how things are kind of structured. Whenever there's a mix that we build those two different ranges. And this is just something we can learn here a little right in button versus small versus small band, this will be way more when we talk about what I said in the beginning about what are we attacking, right? Here, it's a big mix, all balls hands, right? But if we name it, right? 10, 9, we want to fold out villains, king 9 and king 10. Small bet is enough, right? If we have something like king jack, okay, we need need to fold out more like villains, Ace, King, Ace, Jack. Maybe we need a slightly bigger bet, right? It's like not that clear here. It's just a wild mix of things, something like that. We see even five, six, having two outs to that five, betting small, getting slightly value from Ace, King, even that sometimes calls while folding out, actually just like that, like, okay. But there will be more clear examples as well so it's it's but this is the the standard structure of all of it all right i do not get why on the queen we're not attacking the jacks tense but king jack suited queen and two seems to be the same ranges playing against each other to be honest no the queen changes nuts a lot like villain has kings and aces and so on on the queen villain just needs to check way more like on the deuce villain can bluff a lot of things as well right so he has less king jack type of fans in his checking range but he has all jacks tens and nines here he has all jacks tens and nines as well but he has all bluffs as well and it's always important to start attacking the weakest part we attack jacks and tens later right villain checks we step small now he has an easy call here calls like he has you see he has king jack 100 almost king 10 100 ace 10 100 just because he cannot keep going so crazy on that second queen his king's aces are not a huge huge advantage anymore so we bet small and then on the river, get another deuce out there. We build our jamming range and now we make jacks and tens and nines indifferent. We are just shifting things perfectly to our needs. All right. And now let's have a look at the deuce again. I expected more betting from out of position here now. Ace king is the main bet, not king jack.. Check. I want to see more King-Jack betting. So what I said there was not apparently perfectly correct. Out of position EV on the deuce is 109. I just want to check on that. And here it's 99. This is just showing how much worse it is the Queen, right? That the villain needs to slow down more. It's not the King-Jack, Ace-Jack, but it's like the Ace-Kings as well, right? The Ace-King is the the the right example on the deuce villain bets all the aces and kings and keeps going with all the ace kings and on that queen it will be slightly different that he just cannot go with all the kings and aces and he has to give up way more of the ace king but it's like it's very very specific right end of the story is just that queen is way better for imposition and this is why he has more room to do stuff here okay so yeah the term betting polarized so we have seen now the different game plans we are having and this year is the main thing we are having this is what we definitely need to remember to understand how we structure that when it's a mix and this is the the other one, if Willem just went for a small range bet, which lots of people are doing, where then it's like, do we need to deny equity or not? And actually you see, it's kind of the same thing, right? It will be more centered around this year. This strategy, this will be the main strategy. If Willem did bet big, because then he has lots of air that he gave up. And here, the main strategy to focus on will be this one. We've seen like the ace-king or like a king-queen-something word on high card boards where people can go crazy, that we use more linear strategy on the turn when it comes to stabbing. Often it will be mixes, right? Now we have seen that queen-8-5 was actually something where villain was not polarized but he did bet big so we need to figure out that and this is not something we are playing against the solver if we know that someone is not c betting often someone who just checks jacks and tens on queen eight five then it shifts right then he was actually polarized betting and we get back to that strategy with a small bet a lot on the turn. Okay, so it's always thinking about the combinations. What are we attacking? And now the turn I want to talk about again about building that betting range. And often that is just build an easy way. We only call the flop. We have a linear range to choose from. We start with a certain value certain value threshold right so every hand that is better than that and i know this is one age too much i guess but every hand that is better than the certain point is a value bet and plans to jam the river like there are some super exceptions like top set or something that wants to wants to check back but like in general that's the case. And then secondly, which is very important is to find those bluffs. And for that, we need to freaking be aware of our range. We have seen when we're on that ace king four board where we start bluffing sixes, deuces, threes whatsoever and having stuff like that, that is like not intuitive, right? Know your range to start from the bottom then again. Everything in the middle has showdown value. We rather go direction direction showdown and now this is kind of the golden rule here the less showdown value and the more equity versus call down range pocket pair is a two outer remember that two outer to the nuts the better the bluff is right so this is just important because this is where you can find out how many people are missing bluffs. Like I always have that kind of fun thing going on with my buddy when I have like top set checking on the turn, which is like a very typical thing. And then I call down, which is the moment I don't need to bluff catch. It's like I play that line and protect it. And then I see the hands they get to the river with. And usually I should find their, especially when I have top set, I should find their bluffs because I block all the value range. I don't know. The last 15 hands again, I pretty much found one or two bluffs, which just is the confirmation that villains are just not finding those. They are either overfolding the flop or checking that back on the turn. This is kind of a very, very general thing I'm experiencing there. So you don't want to be that person missing those bluffs in a spot like that Thank you. the flop or checking that back on the turn. This is kind of a very, very general thing I'm experiencing there. So you don't want to be that person missing those bluffs in a spot like that where Willem c-bets and then checks. Okay, typical mistakes I wrote down for you here is that we are under bluffing, under bluffing, and under bluffing. It starts on the flop, when checked to, this continues on the turn, any spot, maybe the river, not necessarily, but it depends on how we get to the river. Do we even have clubs? What happens a lot is as well that people play hand strength and not range, right? That they just bet this because they have this hand instead of understanding what their range wants to do, where we can read a lot into them being strong or not, especially something like this year, betting big with Kings and betting small with Jacks. This is something I experience every day. And we can count on that. Yes, they protect their small bet with pocket Queens then, but still combo wise, it's like, yeah, we can go incredibly thinly if they then check the turn. Like when we have queen 10 easy for stacks, right. And stuff like that. This is another clear mistake. And another one is that we are doing or everyone is doing is actually over folding a ton right so we need to defend a lot right when was the last time that you called a big bet here turn was the queen villain checks to you you bet big river is a three you bet again and villain called you down with nines and jacks 50% of the time. You found the ace five call. It's like, I don't know. Pocket sevens calling every single time. I haven't seen it. It's like, yeah, they sit there with their aces and play it maybe a little wrong and then call that one off. That might be the case. But yeah, it's like really in general, when we always look like that, which hands should go to the showdown, we don't find those random catch tricks, right? even though it's like like really in general when we always look like that which hands should go to the showdown we don't find those random catch tricks right even though it feels like people make ridiculous calls it's like yes dangerous when we play against the big blind maybe they start with way stronger ranges but against the small blind we are usually very very safe right maybe if you want to look up something fun check out a board with four flush like in left hand, you can see in game those bluff catchers. Yeah. Like, I mean, I'm not making them either because people under bluff, but I'm not under bluffing that spot. It's like putting in this ace king here to fold up jacks and tens. I mean, all day long, right? So there are reasons why people are not catching. And this is what we want to make use of. So this is typical mistakes. don't want you to do them overfolding obviously we can do especially on the river when people are not bluffing but before not seeing a turn for a cheap price seeing a river and then villains making mistakes is very very a good spot to get into so auto position villains are overfolding correctly against pool because in position from pool is under bluffing. Yes, I don't think that people are doing it for that reasons, but it's like, because they are not fine with their hand anymore. Summary key takeaways is know your range. It's a little sad that we didn't find any of those bluffs, like low pocket bluffs, for example. Second thing is you want to have a sizing plan. If you know what you are doing in this way, you will do lots of stuff correctly, right? It's just, you know your plan, right? I try to talk about it every single time. Willan just did polarized. Willan does that. This is what he represents. And then we come up, like we will make mistakes. I make mistakes. You make mistakes. Everyone does on the table, but having a plan is pretty, pretty good, right? So it's a good start. And then don't forget the bluffs. Know what the bottom of your range is, right? And talk about combinations you attack. So this is something that we can improve in that game. And now maybe again, the spots we did not cover. It doesn't make sense to cover rivers too much to prepare. We didn't talk about raising flops. Just, I hope someone finds the videos, the loons of OMG Kairoudi and put in the notes channel for everyone to share because it fits perfectly to that topic. And maybe we could talk a little about the turn gems as well. Facing a double barrel, but this is a direct reaction to villain strategy on like double barreling strategy. it's always this can be very different if we face someone not playing gto like but to understand the idea that would be some things and everything else like you're taking over initiative against a check is something where we need to build our ranges and can work like that to get better at that better every single time i try to do that every day so i. So I hope you enjoyed that one. See you for the next one. I think there will be, I don't know whether it is announced, but I will do a coaching with Jerome and the guys, cash guys from Malta next week, end of next week, probably on Friday the 9th. I have another one, I guess, just before Christmas, a coaching. For how long you practice, when there are no good tables going, I practice. Or when I have my boy in the morning and he's asleep in the carry thing, then I play like one or two drills after I reviewed my hands. That's my routine right now. So it's like 50 hands is a good number to go through. All right. So yeah, have a good one, guys. And yeah, see you in Discord.
