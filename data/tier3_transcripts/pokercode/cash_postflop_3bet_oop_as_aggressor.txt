### TOPIC: cash postflop 3bet oop as aggressor
 Hello, hello, hello, hello. I guess first people coming in. I see something in the chat that looks good. All right. So it seems finally that this waiting room thing kind of worked out so that we started with more than one people at a time. Yeah. For everyone who is in here now, make sure to join the Kahoot. I'm going to share the screen now. Okay. So sure I can do it. I mean, I was waiting for the session as well. This time I was actually ready with the presentation 15 minutes before three. So I had plenty of time to, to answer the two latest hand histories from very nice hands, actually. Maybe, maybe I will. I sounded a little, a little too hard on that. I think I like both of those hands, just like the starting points. Hey, great to see you, Johanna, as well, back here in the coaching. So let's give them some more time. So two minutes to three. Yeah, and make sure to just have the perfect setup because we will have a couple of quiz questions today. And I went with a 20-second line. So that will be some rapid-fire questions just regarding how to play some boards. Yeah, I think this would be a win to be proud of. So make sure to be ready to really click those buttons in time. So where are all the others? 16 is not enough for now. So 22 in here, 16 in Kahoot. We need more in Kahoot, guys. This is a big part of the coaching today. Actually, I thought about making it a very, very large one or a rather short one, and I decided to go just for the flop play and not talk too much about how to continue, and we leave that for another session. I don't want to overload it every time and go two hours, so we'll just talk about the flop, collect ideas there, have a lot of quizzes, some examples. BÃ¶hm in the office. Come on, as if you were working anything. Welcome, Curtis. What's the time at your place? All right. So that's more Toronto than Vancouver, right? All right. That's decent. That's okay. Wedding went well. You see a ring here. So everything went smooth. Almost perfect weather. Just the moment of the ceremony, ceremony which was outdoor it started raining that will deliver some special pictures i guess but that's it so thanks johanna how i don't know um pics will will follow at some point we're waiting for the pictures from the professional photographer i don't want to put out like random stuff from friends there so hello philip and yeah we maybe you you can Google that. We married in Tuscany, Italy at Casa Cornacchi. So whoever wants to have an impression of how it looks like there, this is what you can check out. So you have an image of how it might have looked. All right, so 25 in Kahoot now. Last minute running, then I'm going to start. But it always seems like it's worth the wait to really have everyone in here as well and this time actually we won't start with a brainstorm I will I will throw you in the cold water and after some some clarification of what it's about today and we are going to jump into the first quiz right away so 25 if there is now 30 seconds happening. I'm starting that one or actually I can start with this year, 26. Okay. I'll leave it open on the side and we'll start with the presentation pretty much. Right. So yeah. Welcome everyone. Let's get started. Next community coaching here. And yeah, I really liked the last one already a month ago now. and today you chose the topic three bad pots out of position the flop play so we are the aggressor and as always to just be sure that we are all on the same page let's define the spot right so what happened someone did open race we are in the small blind or big blind and we do three bet and we get called we are talking about heads up pots here it will be mainly from the small blind this is just where we have we as cash gamers have the widest three betting ranges well because we mainly play three bet only and then we get called by the button by the cutoff by mp by early position i don't care it's a certain range right the position tells us a little about the range but that's it and now it's our turn to build a freaking game plan for the flop so what happens we know the situation we see a freaking flop and now it's all on us usually in most cases we keep an advantage villain did not forbet that means he usually does not have aces he does not have kings in late positions he won, he won't have queens and ace-king. He's maybe missing some ace-queen-off type of fluffy hands. And yeah, that's it. And just to take the most general thing, for all the examples, I will stick to small blind versus button today. The logic works the same way for all the positions because it's the same spot all the time. It's the evaluation of certain hands that is different so we will talk way more about well nuts right now nuts later than like oh on two broadway cards we can go small or whatever right so because that depends on position so we try to focus on that and yeah all examples small versus button. And I guess this brings us to the little structure of the session. It's a short one. Let's see how long it takes actually. But we will start with quiz part number one. Then we hopefully learn that everyone fucks up. and then we'll talk about bet sizings and reasons and try the exact same thing again with quiz number two so quiz number two i can tell you already is exactly the same like quiz number one, obviously different boards, but the same structure. And then we'll summarize the learned stuff and have some key takeaways that I can send you out in the world with to have a way better idea. And then pretty much we have the next community coaching in the pipeline already, because then it's about continuing on the turn in those spots because, well, I can tell you already the stuff that happens the most is we bet someone calls and we are on the turn and have the next problem. So we want to be prepared for that spot and understand what we do, why we do it. And yeah, just understand the whole picture a little better. And then I think now it's time to start the Kahoot. And 28 people, that makes me happy. That's good. And actually, I tell you the question before because it might take 30 seconds to really understand it. And what I did was, I just show you one, maybe not this one. So what I did was I made a script and PIO and did solve eight random boards in that spot. So actually most of them, well, I have looked the numbers up, but that's it. I didn't have a deeper look into it. And I offered three sizings on the flop. So you can see that $100 or whatever is in the middle here. That's just my Zoom 500 sizings, whatever. And these are the bet sizings I offered. We have a check here. We have a quarter pot bet. Then I offered this year was the number 3E, which is the linear sizing over three streets. And the other one slightly over pot is 2E with a plan of just jamming the same percentage on the turn and get it in there. So here we see a board where that is a good mix. And yeah, I will ask you the question, which of those four options will be taken more than 25%? So if you remember that board now, you have a little advantage because this is one part of that. And actually, I give you one board, your small blind versus button. And then you have to click on all the options that we take more often than 25%. So if it's like, I don't know, a board that we range bet small, well, then you do not click on the check and you do not click on the bigger sizes, just the one. To have it correct, you need to hit all of them. Sometimes it's three answers correct. Sometimes it's one answer. So that is how it works. And Peter, you're the last one in here. No, Victor is the last one in here. Now we finally get started. And let's see, always a little weird what happens here. 10, 7, 4, all spades is our first board. You only have 20 seconds. Click on everything that you want to do with a higher frequency than 25%. I give you a hint. We will check a lot here. So this will be the first correct one, but you need to hit all of them very, very fast. I don't know whether you get points for just half the correct answer. I don't know. So here, very clear thing. We will only bet small or check why that is the case and the reasons we will get to that a little later. So we'll just keep going. We will have eight times this question. So seven times more. And let me actually open the chat in case there's something. And so yeah, let's keep going next one let's go king queen three with a flush draw all right three correct answers no one of you likes checking kind of expected that but, but all right. Oh, we got you, Curtis. Let's go. Freaking, freaking seabed tournament players. King, nine deuce again with a flush draw. All right. Here we are getting closer to the range bet. Seems like definitely not checking more than 25%. Ace, 9-9. Again, always spade flush draws. I'm not sure how randomized that is. Felix, are you in the Kahoot actually? Or like I never see you in the top ranks here. So I guess that was the easiest one so far. 553. Oh, that's a different one. Okay. So we don't like the small bet anymore. Maybe something to keep in mind. Ace-nine-five rainbow this time. Again, everyone that clicked on the big bet, maybe think about why that is not the case. We will talk about that later. So I guess it's the next one at last? No, one more. So ace-7-3, again, rainbow. Pretty similar to the ace-9-5. Okay, at least we're quick learners. Sibarino says some of the questions are not multi-select. I don't know how it works. I copy the question type all the time. So I guess maybe that's if it's just one correct answer. I don't know. Should be the same question type all the time. Maybe that's a little hell. Who knows? So we're leading the pack now, finally. Where's my cash gamers? Geduld bitte. I trust you. Let's go. 954 rainbow. Okay, we're getting there. It seems like we are learning already through the questions here. And that was the last one of part one. I think can look at this here so this is how it looks like everyone keep that in mind this is only 50 of the questions so far so you can easily catch up and really win in the end yeah i hope this did bring some questions to us already because now we will talk about bet sizings and the reasons for those and actually let me see what's next this one let's actually start with more questions here because now it's the good old brainstorming and i'm just asking you to get some input when do you bet small just tell me like some reason like don't give me boards i'm not interested in in reading a7-3 now after answering that but like what's your reasons actually for it like you want to maybe deny equity you think of like okay villain has lots of weak stuff maybe you want to keep him in the pot maybe whatever maybe some deeper thoughts i will present you a little something of like how i think in those spots but as always first want to know what what you are thinking about there. So I have more than 20 seconds for that. Actually, one day I will switch Kahoot over to English if I find that. Okay, when we have a big range advantage. Okay. When we range bet, big range advantage, range advantage, later street advantage. That's the first talking not only about the flop, interesting high betting frequencies, equity advantage. Right. So this is ordered in a good way here. When in position has a lot of auto folds. Okay. So we want to make use of him over folding, create EV through that with our weakest hands. We have a big range advantage, pretty much building a pot. Or it's without much equity shift. Seems to be the same a little like later street advantage. So we have advantage and we know we keep it. We are strong in position as marginal hands. Okay. So we actually give him trouble by betting small. That's a big factor. i need to take the pot down without showdown yes if the board does not hit me i bet small for understanding the opponent's range okay if that gives you a hint a betting small for info because we know better how they play versus that can definitely be a thing as well no need when no need too much protection okay so when we need protection maybe we want to bet bigger i i read that in here and villain has air or shit monotone boards that's partly correct nuts over time set the price for the turn extract value deny equity okay here this is i want to put those two together for example when villain has full air or shit on mono boards i'm actually not interested in folding it out. But if that air still has equity that I can deny, then that gets pretty sexy to fold out stuff for a very, very small price. Okay, because I'm a tournament player and I just bet small when clueless. That's what everyone does, even cash players as well. So don't worry. Let villain over call. Again, keep him in the pot. So we see lots of different things. We want to make them fold. We want to keep them in the pot at the same time. We want to do whatever, right? It's like we have very, very different goals that are actually working against each other. And we try to achieve that with the same kind of bet sizing, not advantage, not advantage, not advantage, mono boards, non-dynamic static boards, small equity shifts over time. Keep in the hand. So we see, okay, now what we need to do is really understand that maybe a little deeper to say, okay, these are the actual reasons and these are the ranges we are building. So we have seen already through the quiz that we will pretty much always split our range. We did not, that actually were random boards. Like it was not me selecting any boards. I clicked on the generate random boards button. So, and I think we had one or I think only one board where it was really a range bet or close to a range bet. So all the others, we had a split. We had a betting range and a checking range, or we had a small betting range and a big betting range, and sometimes even three answers. So that should tell us already, okay, we need to be prepared for more than that. And I want to start explaining that a little with talking about nuts a little more. So actually that's not correct, but yeah, let's skip the, obviously the next question is when do you bet big, but let's do that after that slide here. So my main understanding about flops or generally ranges playing against each other is always when there's lots of action left, it's all about nuts. And what, like we had it in the last session maybe someone remembers and can write it in the chat now for me what is our goal when we have nuts the last session was about probing turn and i gave you the same question there what is actually our goal and i made it like fat and exclamation marked it three times like what is our goal when we are having the nuts stack second nuts get the freaking money in right so that's it we want to like what is our goal when we are having the nuts? Stack second nuts, get the freaking money in, right? So that's it. We want to, like what we stack, I don't care. That's something we can focus on. We want to get the freaking money in. So first thing is what our nuts, what they want to do, which line they take, we actually don't care. But it's like, and I'm so happy that no one writes here and we want to bet big. We want to do this or that. No, we want to get the freaking money in. And now it's our turn to understand how we get the freaking money in. So I made two kind of very different ranges that we could build, right? I think most of you know my paint games a little now. Every line there stands for some part of combinations. It represents a range in a way. Left side is weak, right side is strong. So on the very right side, we have the nuts. In the middle, we have like mid pairs and weak top pairs and draws and whatever. On the left side, we have more like bullshit. So the top line here represents a range that is very, very polarized. And now the only question is how do we get money in with our nuts? It's like, well, the only thing we can do is building a range that consists of air and nuts. And that's the only thing we can do with that is betting. Our air forces villain to call down enough. So our nuts get paid. If we check and villain knows how our range looks like, well, villain is never betting. He's just checking down to win against ear. And if he bets, well, he will just donate money into our nuts. So if our range is in a way like that, we definitely want to build polarized betting ranges, which we will pretty much always do when we are betting big. And then another part our range looks like or it can look like is a little more condensed and the second second type of range i'm talking about here is one where we have a big middle part and actually what is that middle part incentivizing our villain to is just well he wants to put pressure on that maybe some of you remember from the last coach what we did when villain has only a middle part well we started overbetting and shit so we tried to put maximum pressure on that and here it's the same when our range is like all mid pairs what we will then do he will build a betting range consisting of better hands and well air that he can add them to have full equity at the same time. If our range looks like that, how do our nuts get the most money in? Well, they just check and we give up our air. So we check, villain is incentivized to keep barreling a lot. And this is how our nuts make the most money while, well, protecting the rest of our range in a way. Protecting in that way just means if villain is not betting enough, well, our nuts earn less money, but the other part of our range is winning money. Same thing for the betting with a polarized range. If villain is not calling us down, well, he just falls against our ear all the time. If he is calling down, he's paying off our nuts. So that's the first ideas of like how it works. I'm always thinking about how does my range look like? Is it a little more like that? I would say something like deuce, deuce, deuce is pretty close to that. Sure, I have something like pocket sevens and pocket eights, which is in between, but mainly I have a strong over pair or I have two random high cards. If have something like this year let's say ace king queen yes i have ace five i have king jack i have queen jack sure i have aces kings and queens as well so it's it's a little more like that where everything like it's very tough for me to have some full shit right i i mean i don't even have a draw like draw, like giving up my five, six of spades on ace, king, queen without a spade seems okay, right? It's not like I want to push some equity. So our goal here is to build this range consisting of medium, strong hands and nuts. And that is mainly a checking range, which forces Willem to bet in a polarized way. So that as like the first slide of like how I'm thinking in that spot, what makes sense to me? And then we'll go a little deeper in the next one. And now the next question for you, I guess I told you too much now already, but whatever, right? Let's, this is not no points. Just when do you bet big? Not when you, when do you think it makes sense for now, right's really when do you actually bet big give me examples if you like now here i like examples try to to really describe when you are betting big what is the reason for that etc okay plenty of input again that's's great. Straight draws available for villain. Okay, so probably not only straight draws, but it's more like a certain kind of like range part that has not equity, like a certain amount of not equity. When I don't like my opponent and want to put him in a nasty spot, I think this is a kind of a mistake here because the bigger you bet, the easier it should get for villain. Well, maybe in some spots not, but mainly it's just very, very easy because it allows you to throw a lot of shit away. Nut advantage. Well, we have nut advantage for the small bet as well. So, I'm not sure. Force villain to fold lots of equity, make his life miserable okay we are definitely hating our villains that's a good thing i bet big when i have draws or i have air with range advantage on high cards so betting on high cards so okay equity advantage protection so protection is a word i'm trying to never use pretty much that would be a whole different topic for a community coaching, I guess. But I tried to name it more precisely. Do you mean with protection? Let me turn that around. Most people mean with protection, they have something good and villain might outdraw them. What they do is they bet big, villain calls his flush draw. Is that protecting? where depending on the stack that is left, it just means that, well, we are building a bigger pot out of position in a spot that will often get miserable for us later. So this is why I want to be more precise with that. And it's either denying strong equity hands, which would mean if I want to really protect from a flush draw, well, I need to bet like 1.5 times pot that villain cannot call. Then it would be denying equity. Or I say, hey, villain has those draws. I cannot fold them out. And what I'm doing is I'm not protecting, I'm charging them. But I win 65% versus a flush draw with my overpair. So it's great for me to get money. It's like the term protection works a little better in position when there is not like no streets left, when Willen is not really donking. So it's a little, I hope you get the point where the problem with the word protecting is because it does not really mean something. Protect equity. I don't know what it means. We don't need to deny equity. So here, right? What you mean here is we don't need the small bet because folding out eight, nine is not a success, right? But instead we can, we can tackle something that has more equity, like queen, jack, queen, 10, villains, king, X right away, something like four or five, maybe even the weakest aces, right? So we use a big size for that. Oh, bluff. We bet big with bluffs. build pot a deep stack much more than shorter speaking of tournaments yes we need to bet bigger in general to get the money in that's correct if people overfold bottom range and only call with few hands anyway well then i like to bet small actually if they overfold their weaker hands right if i bet big i force them to call just a few hands if they do so while i'm playing their game pretty much so i'm not i'm not sure and that probably prefers polarizing when i want to polarize myself put max pressure on medium part make his life tough with his middling hands well we learned that last time as well that only works out when villain is not protected with enough nuts. So maybe one thing we could say here, villain is not having too many nuts. Protection, equity denial, when current nuts won't stay the nuts later. Here, this is the first time I'm really reading about, I mean, it's part of protection as well. It depends on how we understand it. But this year is really talking about the future streets and current nuts won't stay the nuts later. This is like the term pretty much I will use as well. Nuts now, but not over time. That is definitely my term. Yes, I have a big hand trying to get paid. So we definitely learned that before already. It's not about getting paid. It's getting the maximum money in whatever line that is. If I think that is by betting, well, then we will bet big as well. So lots of things. And you see, like, I've just tried to comment as much as possible to give you that feeling of like, where it makes sense. What are we actually talking about and which little things maybe do not make too much sense. And we need to just change our thinking regarding them a little. Okay. So that's size and reasons. It's always, I just made that presentation. I have no clue what's next. So let's see. This is the main thing here for me. What are the reasons for bets pretty much? Or when it is all about nuts, what can be different regarding nuts? And I made the big difference between nuts right now and nuts over time. Actually, the first line here should be a headline that looks a little weird. Nuts only now versus nuts over time. Let's start with nuts right now. This is a spot where we have the nut advantage, which we pretty much have always, but we lose it over time, right? There are very few boards where aces, kings, and queens do not count as nuts anymore. So this is why we always keep a nut advantage or almost always. So a big thing is now when we want to use a big bet or when it's about nuts right now, we are just incentivized to build the pot now and not wait, right? The very easy example here would be pocket tens on nine, five deuce. A pocket tens is freaking nuts now. But if the turn is a jack, a queen, a king, an ace, maybe another nine, maybe an eight, a seven, a six, a four, or a three, well, maybe our tens are still a strong value bet, but definitely not nutted in a way. Villain is catching up on all cards. Our pocket tens would like to just get the money in now versus ace nine. It's two things even. It's not only, well, we won't have nuts anymore, but it's just villain is not forced to defend that many weaker hands anymore because he knows he's protected right now if you bet big here's no way villain folds a nine or a five right if the turn is a queen and the river is a king villain will definitely not stack off a five or a nine right he has a random bluff catcher maybe at some point same thing with pocket queens on jack seven six with a flush draw we hate every king we hate every ace we hate every jack we hate well a nine is maybe fine but we definitely hate every ten we hate every eight we hate every seven as well in a way we hate every spade and a five as well how about we'll change the situation if the flop had flush draw at 10 10 and same makes it even more that we are willing to get the money in right now right right? Then it's not only the over cards and the under cards being bad, but every suit as well. So a deuce for now is a fine card for us. And if the flush draws at us, well, one of the deuces is a bad card as well. So yes, actually just like makes that effect even bigger. It changes something slightly because we will have flush draws as well. So it's just looking at our tens, it's bad, but for our range, it's actually okay. Same thing. And then pocket Queens. This is like a good example for what I talked about protection before. If I bet half pot here for protection, everything I'm doing is just building a pot in a spot that will get miserable for me. And I know it right now, right? If you want to bet pot here and jam the turn, I think that can make sense. Just like I have nuts right now. I you want a bad pot here and jam the turn i think that can make sense just like i have nuts right now i stop the hand here now or on the turn on a freaking four double flush draw so that's pretty good and what we do at the same time is we kind of clean some outs if we bet small let's go back to the pocket tens if we bet small with pocket tens on nine five twos will and is floating all over cards turn is a all that sucks turn is a king that sucks but if we let's say let's put like really think about that if we were over betting or pot betting our pocket tens here do we still care about a king or a queen not really villain sits on five x nine x maybe some kind of ace four whatever and our tens are easily good enough to stack off so it's it's just like the understanding the incentives not saying that we want to just always pot bet when we have it we need to find gloves as well and then make that all a nice little range but the incentive is there all right now the big difference nuts over time right it's like hands well we have the advantage and we will keep it over time and we know that already now there we have the clear incentive to keep villain in the pot to improve to a second best hand or to just like float random shit and invest money in the world so i took here the nut flush draw ace king of spades on six four deuce three spades i don't want to fold out villains queen jack of diamonds let him float that against a very small bet or let him bet that or just check check and the turn is a queen, only good stuff happening in a way. Pocket kings on king a3, well let villain hit his set with sixes or sevens or fives or whatever. So here we can either bet small and villain floats his ace jack and hit something, right, instead of betting big doesn't make any sense. And this is something, well obviously there i just looked for the maximum examples now but there will be lots of things in between but that gives you in a way a ranking how you see some boards right it's just okay what going back to this year pretty much what is the main thing on those boards right so here let's look at 952s our-2s. Our main thing is we have something strong. We have the over-pairs. Or we have a draw, mainly over cards, like 6 outs to hit a nice top pair. We don't have too much 8-7-5-x. That's not too much. So it looks a lot like that. And this should tell you right away, okay, it's more about probably betting big or checking right it's like betting big with a bluff or air or giving up some the next part i want to talk about or we'll get to which sizings make sense let me just sneak preview here all right so let's talk about when certain sizings or lines make sense and let's start with the smallest sizing we are having. Let's just answer that question first. When we play polarized with pocket tens, what bluffs are we using on 9-5 deuce rainbow example? Well, think about it yourself. It's those that benefit from the hands that villain is folding against the big bet. Let's say villain would be floating king queen versus a small bet, but it's folding versus big bet should tell you right away what gudulpita is saying here queen 10 queen jack king 10 whatever that backdoor flush or something we can potentially jam on the turn maybe even yeah a7 why not right just will be a good mix we want to like the goal is in the end to cover certain turn cards and then the lookalike principle and the just like thinking about what is well unfolding versus the big bet that helps us in a way. Cleaning outs. This is pretty much the thing. It will be a lot, a big mix, right? It's just add-ons to the value range. If we look in PIO, there are some hands that make sense and other hands that do not make sense, but out of those that make sense, it will be always a big mix. It's not where the value is coming from. It's not like Jack-10 is the way better, bigger bet. We find reasons for a small bet as well. Okay, so let's get back to the certain lines we're having. And I want to start with the smallest bet we are having. And the smallest bet out of position, I call it a bet as well, is just the bet of zero, the check. And that's the only option we are having to not invest money. And this is the way we should think about the check in the first place. We need a checking range when our range is not strong enough to bet the full range. And I'll get back to your questions after I explain that. So if we cannot bet our full range, our thoughts should be on the weakest hand we are having. Let's say 9-5 deuce. We did 3-bet king-8 of, let's say, hearts, right? We don't have the backdoor. That's probably the weakest hand we can be having. Or we have a king-jack offsuit with not even blocking some of the backdoors. So that's the weakest stuff we are are having. And if we cannot range bet, well, this is the only option for us to not invest money with those is to have the check, to go for the check fold. So we need a checking range whenever we are not strong enough. That's the first thing to think about because well, once we need that, we don't want to check here only. Then we have a reason for us to put something in there, to put medium strong hands in there, maybe some nuts to build a range in a way that looks like that. And then we keep going from there. So when we think about the small bet, well, it's like, do we have fold equity or is it just a range bet to start building a pot? Because our advantage is so big and villain needs to overfold because we are just way stronger. So we gain EV from our weakest hands by letting Villa fold or by all kinds of hands, because we are just building a pot in a situation that is very, very, very favorable for us. And then how we build a bigger bet. We'll talk about that in it, or we did already here. So let's get back to the question from Ciberino on nine five, three, I guess guess 952s, there's also a lot of big betting with weaker 9X, such as 10-9 suited. Same principle of getting value now. I always got the problem thinking what we are not getting stacks in versus worse. Yes, that's just if people are too nitty, well, we need to deviate there. But in general, 10-9 or 952s is just a stack off. And the best way is not to wait until there is a queen. It's just getting money in now, fold out king queen, getting money in versus pocket eights, getting money in versus five X, et cetera. It's just the best thing that can happen to you. It's just, for me, it's more about building the wardrobe first where we say, okay, on that board, I'm just betting big or I'm checking. That's it. And then there are no questions asked anymore. It's like 10-9, then is a check or a big bet. You can start with a small bet there, but then you're face up all the time. So what Geduld says is a villain is basically just continuing better 9x as his 10s and jacks against your big bet. So that's not the best option. Well, then we bluff the shit out of him, right? We can have a look at the board maybe a little later where it's just shown that to defend enough you still need to float a lot of shit so if people are overflowing let's take every freaking king jack off suit so we barrel that hand off on a low card run out probably yes but we'll talk about the turn next time probably then things will change because as we figured out every every part changes the nuts on the turn. So everything will change. So it does not make too much sense to plan ahead. Okay. So for me, important now, understanding that concepts of nuts now and nuts over time. So pocket queens on jack seven, six tens on nine, five juice like that lowest over peer is usually a thing. Top pair, top kicker can be a thing and then the i call it like invulnerable nuts but they want to keep everything in they want to see more cards like the nut flush draw that will i mean we are not talking about getting out drawn from a set like i'm not talking about that right pocket kings on king a3 are not scared of villain making quads that's not like important and yeah now let's really talk about i talked about the check when we need it already and then we need to build a range around that and now we'll talk about like what we are targeting right so once we understood what makes sense in general right or to decide which sizings make sense in general to build our wardrobe we need it's about what we are attacking again right how strong is our range range? How strong is villain's range? And here I pretty much just wrote down the examples you gave me before. What do we target with a small bet? Well, weak showdown value without potential to improve. Air with very low equity, one over card. Can be like, let's talk about, I don't know, queen 7-3. Villain can have king 8 suited. That's something we like to fold out. It's three outs to hit the top here. Weak showdown value. Villain has pocket force on king 9-5. That's great to fold out. Something like pure backdoors. Villain has 9-10 suited on queen 7-3. Great if we fold that out. That's good for pretty much everything we are having. What do we target with a big bet? As well, weak showdown value, just we put maximum pressure on it. We attack air with medium equity. Remember, villain is in position. That boosts his equity in a way because, well, he will always see first what we do and just steal pots in certain spots. So air with medium equity, I said just two overs. Perfect example, 9-5 deuce. King-queen is something we want to attack and we do not attack that with a small bet. Something like weak gut shots and backdoors. Say on king-10 deuce, if we bet big, what is villain doing with jack-9? Now, this is what I mean with a weak gut shot, not a nut gut shot, but this is what we're doing here. Let's talk about the queen-7-3. When villain is having ace-5 suited with a backdoor flush draw against a small bet, easy call, or even a raise if he wants to, but against the big bet, he hates it. And that is our goal. All right, let's have a look again at the questions here. Maxi is asking, how much does position come into play in general? I would have said we have less incentive to bet small out of position because we achieve less. Yes, that's absolutely correct. Regarding when we think about full equity, we love betting small when you're pushing our equity, when we have an overall range advantage, because it's just a great option to not split our range. But if we have something like pocket eights on queen, seven, three, I love betting it, folding out some kind of king nine, getting called by all kinds of things while keeping my range together. That's great for that part, but really having fold equity, it's like the small bet out of position is, yeah, only in spots where you can really attack some shit, where villain has shit. Actually, I don't want, let me have a look at, I want to show that now. I got to find a board now. What was one of the random boards? 10, 7, 6, 5. I have 9, 5, 4 was part of the quiz or it was was still coming. I'm not sure. I think this is still coming. Was 9, 5, 4 part of the quiz? Does anyone know? Yes, it was part of the quiz. So we can show it. Okay. So this is now pretty much the example here. The correct answer here was the biggish bet and the check. And actually that over bet, and we see the first hand that wants to do it is like pocket tens. It can be a play here. Now it's our turn to think about that, to simplify. I don't want to split four way here. So I'm using, I can tell you my wardrobe is your one big size. That's a little bigger than 58, but smaller than 108 and the check. Pocket tens is pretty much most of the time a bet and sometimes a check with a plan then to check raise. Plan is just to get the money in. I can adjust a little to whoever my villain is. And now to just see what the effect is and what Muxy came up with here regarding the small bet out of position, especially in those things. Well, if we were in position and we bet small here, villain is folding all his like king queen offsuit. But if bet here you can check out villains fold equity or pio's fold equity versus that small bet just in position is such a big boost that he just shouldn't fold anything pretty much now you can fold his freaking king jack like really the i mean he's forced to almost or to call the weakest hand in his range 50 of the time maybe you can fold king eight hop king eight of hearts is the only fold that is here. So if we don't hit at all, for example, ace, 10 on nine, five, three, do we prefer to check or bet big? We see it here. We only offer ourselves the big bet and the check. And the weakest hand, since we have a checking range, the weakest hands in our range have to go in the check fold. That's the only option to not invest money. Here, I would say what is our weakest 10, actually tough to find because all that connects, but King-Jack offsuit and Ace-10 offsuit, especially those containing a heart and having wrong blockers against villains folding range is the weakest 10. And that has to be our check fold. So I hope that answers that a little. And I think now we're maybe a little smarter already and have an idea to think about words. You don't need to fold out King, Queen, King, Jack with ace, 10. I would love to fold out King, Queen and King, Jack with ace, 10. Definitely. I like to fold that out. Okay. So yeah, let's get to quiz part number two. And maybe we are a little smarter now, probably not too much. And we will look, we'll have the quiz now, and then I'll go in detail to one or two examples so one more question is it bad logic to think that betting small prevents us from facing a larger bet if we check so we get closer to shoulder i don't know when you can predict what villain will be doing if your hand is strong enough to go somehow direction showdown the small bet can be fine as well we will see. I was just so far talking about the weakest hand in your range. If you have a checking range, just belongs in the check fold, right? Your strategy is already investing money. If your range and the hand you're talking about is worth investing some money, that can be fine. That's pretty much the pocket eights on queen seven three. I like to put out the small bet exactly for the reason you mentioned and to keep the range together. It's not like I'm checking I have a pair between seven and queen. Does the board tell you which part of villain's range to attack? Actually, my hand tells me a little more what I want to attack, but the board tells me what are villain's biggest range parts. If the board is nine five deuce, villain's biggest range part is over cards. So I would like to find a sizing that attacks random overcards. And actually at the same time, that is the perfect sizing against his two outer pocket peers in between as well. So that's pretty good. If the board is ace, king, queen, well, I'm maybe just, this is the main part I'm attacking is maybe nines, eight, seven, six, fives, fours, threes, and deuces. So I use a very small sizing if I use one. We had something like ace, king, four before, I guess, as an example. But let's see. I don't want to talk about too many examples because now it's time for the next quiz. And let's see how we do. And my fingers are crossed for my cash gamers here. So sorry, Mihoor, try to keep the lead, but I think they'll get you. Same questions like before, but I changed it to 20% to make it a little more interesting. So we need to be a little more precise now. Again, which lines are we using? Everything more than 20%. You should click on 6, 5, 2s is not 9, 5, 2s, but still a very nice low board. And obviously I had to switch it to 20% because the 108% was like 21.7% or something. So I just wanted to have that in there. It's pretty, I mean, pretty similar to the 952s, just even more. Willem just has two overcards all the time. And actually his over, like all his peers are not peers in between. They are like top peers or over peers, which makes it it a little stronger and we'll just keep going. King five deuce rainbow. Okay we are king high board right we use a big bet it's because well it's not a second high card so the peers are pretty strong ace four ace three connects with that which people have full frequency we are not strong enough nuts over time because there is no no broadway connectivity so we need a checking range it's like yeah it's different than a king nine deuce board okay jeremy let's let's go for it. Speed matters in those questions here. Hannes, let's go. Queen-8 deuce with a flush draw. You have seen that before very shortly. Maybe someone of you remembers. So actually, there's more shit that we can attack with it. Like the queen eight connects better with our small blind range. And there's more shit in Willem's range that we can attack with a small bet. Like pocket fours without a diamond. Ace five of clubs. Four five of whatever. So here the small bet makes sense. The big bet as well. Pocket kings. First hand we are betting big here. Or are incentivized to bet big. Obviously we'll end up mixing something. But stuff like that. Oh, oh oh oh oh change on the top here let's go 10 7 3 with a flush draw and don't worry siberino every tournament player is range betting king five deuce no matter how deep all right i like seeing all those over bets here i mean that's it's a fun board right the small bet doesn't make any sense like everything is connected or has two over cards so let's forget about the small bet say but you know you can go for small bets in tournaments people will still be folded folding their ace queen of diamonds there because i don't know you might have kings but yeah definitely we need a checking range we need to give up our a6 of hearts here we definitely want to bet like a normal-ish big size and that over bet if we have the freaking pocket jacks without a spade here or ace 10 or queens or whatever that's just a freaking freaking way to go king jack deuce Severino, your turn probably now, or maybe not. Okay, we're not checking, guys. Definitely not checking here. But small bet, it could be one that we range bet with a small bet, but we are incentivized for the big bet as well. Ace-10, ace-queen, jack-axe, queen-10 x queen 10 10 9 so many hands that we can attack with a bigger size but the small bet is obviously our our main sizing here four or five of clubs ace five pocket all the pockets lower than a jack etc okay this is a real fight now ace king four i'm very interested in this one again the question is what would be correct, like given the parameters I put into Pio. The question is not how our tournament player is playing. All right, so no one likes to check here pretty much, but it's actually the highest frequency, right? That's what we talked about, and someone had it before in the comments even. We don't need to deny equity. It's that, remember, maybe I want to show that again here. This is just the definition more or less of, I have so much stuff open here. So of this range on the bottom here, we have all the ace acts in the world and we have all the king acts in the world. We have queens, we have jacks, and we we want to carry them to showdown and this is the reason why we will check most of our nuts as well we'll check aces and kings lookalike principle very very often here tell me if you want to build a big betting edge what are your bluffs right so what are your bluffs you want to fire your freaking seven eight of hearts nothing nothing so it's a high frequency checking board, but that's like one that does not really fit my rules because we have range advantage. We have range advantage right now. We have it over time. That's one of the exceptions boards for other reasons, because well, the small bet just does not accomplish too much. What we could do is on that board, decrease the sizing of our small bet. We can put, you can try that yourself and Pio and put in like a 10% bet because on that board, we don't need to bet 25% to really tackle something. We can bet even lower, which could work on monotone boards, for example, as well. So that just, just an idea, right? It's not sad that the small bet always has to be 25%, but this is the reason why here is more checking. Overbet a lot could be an idea. Actually, let's take a look. That's very interesting. Let's take a look. I think it's just we won't get to the 20%, but I think it could make sense. Bet big or bet 108% seems all kind of reasonable, just we did not reach the 20% we need. So here we see the mix. What we see is exactly all the incentives we talked about. Everything what you see with small sizing here, that very light red, you see like not a single hand clearly wants to do that. If I keep the solver running, that will even disappear a little more. If I offer a smaller sizing, that frequency will go up. The only hands that are willing to build a polarized betting strategy are like those here. Nuts right now, but not over time. Ace-King, Ace-Queen, Ace-King, Ace-Queen added with the gut shots. Like those cards where we won't have nuts on the turn, we want to make new nuts. So this year is like the best. And we build a polarized range. And then it's like a big sizing seems good, whether it's the very big one or the medium, big one, whatever. And then we add like the lowest pocket pair, for example, with a spade, just because it's the best bluff we are having. With two outs, with a backdoor flush draw, actually, I wonder a little about why the fives are not there. That's probably a locker thing that we don't want to block four or five suited or something like that but this is how you see how the structure of the big bet works here exactly how we designed it before those hands that are nuts right now but are not necessarily nuts over time with the correct add-ons here pocket sixes queen jack queen 10 jack 10 super nuts, in a way, obviously a flush hurts them as well, but they have a redraw. Sometimes it's a paired card. Anyways, aces, kings, they are just strong enough and they go in our invulnerable range. They are there to protect, to play the lookalike role. Aces play like ace nine and ace eight. Kings play like king, jack, and king, ten, et king 10 etc okay so very interesting board that ace king 4 let's go i think it's second last one last chance almost last chance so now i think is it like three four people still in contention i guess so curtis just make sure to keep in the stay in the top five and let's see ace king 4 should have been the most difficult one ace 9 3 with a flush draw Thank you. say ace king four should have been the most difficult one ace nine three with a flush draw all right we check or we bet some people will go with the range bet if we are making it rainbow probably get away with the range bet even but okay who knows and last one patience don't punt it. No, don't punt it. No, stay patient. Eight, five, four rainbow. All right. So we go with almost range check here. Actually the big bets are fine as well. actually, this is almost the representation of the frequencies, I guess. Just the overbet didn't make the cut. I actually thought, because it was the last question, to change it to 8-6-4, to not have the two-peer and straight for 6-7-4-5 for in position, because then I'm pretty sure the overbet will be a thing more than 20%. I guess, yeah, it's like about 15%. And let's just look at the winners here. Congrats, Hannes, on bronze. Jeremy, good job. And obviously, my cash game boy, patience, please. Just shipping it here. Okay. So yeah, congrats to you guys. And we'll keep going a little, just looking a little in-depth at depth at one or two and hope that already had some learning effects just thinking thinking about all that kind of stuff how i will evaluate that how that fits to the solvers how that explanation works out and now let's just i mean everyone can participate but i'm really asking for this year for let's take our top five guys, everyone who is very, very convinced of his answers, feel free to answer in the chat as well, because we'll now look at the two examples. So first example is queen, eight deuce. Remember we are small blind versus button, three bad pot, queen, eight deuce with a flush draw. And now we are really want to not talking about frequencies, but really the hands. And now I want you to just write me exactly what is missing here. What are the hands that are most interested in the big bet? We talked about it. Those are the hands that are nuts now, but not later. What are the first value hands that Pio wants to bet big? And what are the good add-ons we could put into that range? I can say bluffs, but it's not really bluffs, right? They have some, some backdoor stuff going probably, or some other reason for betting. And then are there any specific hands that are maybe interested in a small bet or check? So we have the first answer from Patience, please. With pocket Kings as a value hand, King Jack suited as, as an add-on and any more. Let's, let's, let some things flying in there next slide there will be my answer which i did as well without looking at the sim so we're from pc ace queen king queen queens aces kings i'm not sure about those queens everything else is kind of the same hand strength i mean kings aces obviously a little better than the queen x the top set, I think we don't want to put in the big betting range. Add-ons, Jack-10 as a gut shot fits from like the draw perspective. Since we don't have a single Jack or 10 in our value betting range, like my personal feeling says, it's not the perfect one. And it's like Jack-10, I prefer to play a little like Jacks and 10s. Ace-Jack with a diamond, King-Jack with a diamond. I like those a lot. Gives us nice potential for the turn. Same here from Mammoth, pretty much. Small, Pocket Queens, Pocket 8s, Pocket 9s, Pocket 10s, Ace-8s. So we have the super nuts that want to protect everything. And the weak value that actually wants to get to showdown cheaply because it's winning off. Okay, add-ons for the big bet, or for this, I guess for the big bet, nice five orders, like seven, eight. I'm not sure. It's giving up lots of showdown value. Small bet, okay. Yeah, I didn't ask for the small bet add-ons because that's like random shit most of the time. But okay, let's just have a look. So you see like this is how it works for me in-game as well. I think my range through, I make, build my wardrobe on that board, I know right away I use a small bet and I use a big bet. I want to know the cornerstones of all my ranges. I have a checking range as well. This is one of the special boards where I use three ranges. And most of the time, I'm someone who likes simplifying more than he should. And I like to make it like small only or check only or small and check and big and whatever. So here I know ace seven of hearts, I need to give up. Ace five of clubs, I need to give up. Whatever is left, I need to give up. So I have a checking range. Because I have that, I want to have pocket queens, pocket eights, sometimes in a small bet, sometimes in a checking range. The first hands that want to be in a big betting range and i can actually go here is pocket kings pocket aces obviously i can write ace queen without a diamond maybe as well but those are really the ones that want to get it in now and my add-ons were like ace of diamonds 10 ace of diamonds jack just give me very nice potential they block continuing range they have equity against calling range especially that overcard is very nice a king jack king 10 saying way ace king i'm not sure it's just like the obvious lookalike to kings and kings and aces hands interested in small bet check i just thought about the real value hands queens pocket a it's king queen i thought it's not strong enough to really stack like get it i mean sure to get it in but it's not like okay i want to get it in now because it's kind of isolating against like ace queen in the strong draw so i rather keep it in the small and that ace king of both diamonds seems to be one that just likes to keep keep hands in can you give some examples of hands you would play differently on this board when you compare out of position and in position i think this is not possible because out of in position will be totally different ranges depending on the spot like big blind versus small i will play 100 differently cutoff versus mp i have a tight linear range and i will i will use way more small betting in position because we have learned that out of position we need to attack villains to over cards for example or whatever gut shot we need the big bet because he has equity plus positional advantage when i'm in position well villain might have some equity but still has the positional disadvantage so it will be way way way more small betting right so much mixing on that board apart from kings ace queen there are no hands that really prefer the larger sizing so this is now a little test just right this is i didn't look at the sim before to do that and we can test ourselves right we see the mix here checking definitely a thing small bet definitely the biggest thing big bet definitely a thing and now let's just have a look right i said my first cornerstone was i checked fold a7 of hearts this is just very important to do because betting this is just very bad and then i think about the big size okay pocket kings pocket aces they fit in there we see some ace queen and then king queen is already the shift where we see more of the small size i'm not sure whether that is big enough for you here but i think that's it we even see the 7-8 the 5 outer here makes sense right so I could do a bit to put that in the small bet. I was not sure what he meant, but actually he just had a reasoning that fits for both. A nice 5-outer when betting big, it's okay in a way. So whenever we find a reason, the Jack-10 that I did not like too much because of the lookalike problem, it's a nice gut shot. Why not? King-Jack-jack that I put in there, just an overcard backdoor straight draw, maybe added backdoor flush draw, perfect, right? Ace-10 with the ace of diamonds, pretty much always in the big bet, just works perfectly, right? It folds out ace-jack right away. That's perfect. And just having the diamond gives you nice options for the turn. Obviously some flush draws will be in the big bet as well. Ace three of diamonds. So it's just, it works like that. And whether you nail those frequencies, I don't care at all. All right. But you want to know the cornerstones always. Small bet. Sure. We don't need to talk about pocket nines that this feels great as a small bet, but I want to know what are my nut hands. So I have pocket Queens. I have pocket eights. Small bet or check is pretty close. Then another cornerstone I will always put in there is the hand that I cannot value bet myself for three streets is usually the hand that I use to just check call down that villain cannot value bet to light himself. That would be my queen jack here. I start betting that small and then checking or I start checking right away or mix it in a way i don't want to i don't want that villain can value bet queen 10 for three streets so this is pretty much where i draw the line and then that's already enough in my head to really i know pretty much how my big betting range looks like even though i have no clue of frequencies i know how my small betting range and my checking range looks like and where like the cornerstones are and everything else is like, okay, I sometimes have that random mid-gear, I have random gut shots, sure. And then I'm like, have to make decisions. But having the structure of your range in your mind in a way just helps a lot for then further actions. Yeah, perfect. I think we just need to make sure that our natural small bets are not making the small bet range too weak. So queen's eights in there is probably not enough. And we need to mix in all the other mate hands. Yes. I mean, it's just everything goes in the small bet or check that it's not the big bet. So the big bet is kind of the exception that we are thinking about. And here, that's the important thing that we know. Queen, jack, queen, 10, queen, nine. Those are the ones that are like, I won't fold pretty much no matter what on a brick run up. So have a good day alex and yeah then obviously we need to make sure to have those give ups as well right this is very very important but the biggest just look at the ev difference betting big with a7 of hearts is like losing two dollars it doesn't seem big because it's probably the biggest difference you find here but what you do with pocket kings that's all all same EV in the simulation. Pocket queens, sure, betting big is bad because you block all queen X, but it's still not such a big mistake like doing that. So just having those give ups is pretty important to not end up with a small betting range that is just blasted. Okay, let's do one more. Example number two, ace, seven, three. And again, top five. I forced you to answer here something and everyone who thinks he has a clear answer, feel free to join here. So what are the hands that are interested in a big bet? Nuts now and not later. And then hands that are interested in a small bet or check. All right, anything to add here to our winner? Ace, queen, ace, king. Could not be a thing in cash, but what are your thoughts on CBET 10%? It's very close to check and I see it more and more in tournaments. Happens mostly in position. So yes, that happens more in position. Out of position, you can do that. Like on some boards where I mentioned it already, like Ace-King 4, where you always want to attack something. In position, you're pretty much attacking that he is out of position already. Out of position, he can just say, okay, I call and see what the next street brings. If you check, he doesn't need a hand to have good spots to get in there. And for that price, he doesn't have to get into good spots often. So you see that more with lower SPR, like four bad pots, you can see that even then out of position and three bad pots, just some exceptional exceptional boards i use it as an exploit on monotone boards because people overfold against that like people are not floating their queen jack of diamonds on a7 three of spades like all spades which they should so i'm using it there as an exploit like it's not really a real thing so pc joins for the ace king ace queen pocketrees, we are not three betting in cash games, small blind versus button. So we don't have that. But yeah, actually, I mean, it was kind of a trick question to just show how to think there. And this is my answer here. Like maybe ace-king, but actually not a single hand that wants to bet big. And hands interested in small blind check, like it's just almost anything. Just folding out something like jack-10 for villain, like just all the broadways that don't have an ace it's just very good for for the majority of our range so here my reason for not interested in big bets is yes the nuts can change on the turn but not with like lots of combos but the nuts change when there's a four or five or six and then villain adds with the six four common combinations of straights and two combinations of two pairs, maybe the set of sixes that I have myself, but really thinking about nuts right now, not later is when you want to stack off, but you won't on further streets. So let's have a look at the first example again here. Queen eight deuce with a flush draw. We have pocket Kings, right? What happens when we bet small? Turn is a freaking ace. Okay, our kings cannot stack off anymore. Turn is a freaking 10 and we play a river. So yes, right now our kings are happy to stack off, but things will change, right? So lots of river cards will suck. What about, well, we don't need to talk about diamond. Kings, 50-50 check, bet, whatever. It's like really big problem. We are, now let's go to the ace 7-3. So, and Jeremy, this is exactly what we are talking about right now. Do we actually bet big here that often? No, we are not. Just doesn't make sense. Like, and we don't need. Is there any hand where your ace king will lose its value? Ace king has value against ace queen and ace jack ace-jack, mainly. And even when the turn is a five or a six, that will go in. So we see here the big bet is just not a thing. The first hand that would like to bet big is ace-king though. That has some incentives to just get it in now because it's just strong but vulnerable in a way. But not really, given that board. It can be a little different when it's like, I don't know know just add a flush draw and maybe do we have a flush draw here i don't know but yeah that was a little trick question just thinking about okay what are we actually attacking how will the board change in our favor what i just did is one thing i think through in game quite often is just which turn cards do i like or not like just like i like, I have ace king, like choose. I like all of them. Obviously a six is not perfect. Adding a flush draw is not perfect, but then we can still size up or check rates or whatever. It's pretty easy here. So I don't need to get the value right now. And I keep everything together in one range, which just makes it quite nice to play. Okay. And that brings us pretty much to the end, which is again, just summarizing things up. Today is not a clear guideline because it's way more of how we see the board. I want to leave as much as possible open to you and only present what makes sense, what your small bet is, what your big bet is, how you simplify, right? We've seen very often three different answers. Most of the time, they are three correct answers with ranges most of the time i'm playing two right the queen eight deuce was a very very exceptional board where i really want to have all three on some boards i'm actually just playing one small range bet or even when it's like only 30 percent bet but big bet oh i can range check on those low boards actually, and then play more check-raise game tree. It's just understanding the incentives for different range parts in our hands is the key here for me. So we want to go step-by-step again. Strength of our range tells us whether we need a checking range. When we are not super strong and we can range bet, then the most important focus is to check-fold those hands that need to check fold. If we don't do that, we build a pot with a hand with two weak ranges in a way. So just the auto small c-bet will be just burning money in a way. Keep an eye on people that are doing that. Just call all shit. You have seen it in PIO that calling everything on 9-5-2s versus a small bet is correct. And if people are c-betting too wide there, well, it's even better. We're having position. We see more turn cards where we know that will give us new nuts. So this is very important. Then the nut advantage now or over time tells us the sizings we want to use. In general, we are looking at the sizings that have the picture of those ranges in mind. Are we building a polarized range that is gaining its value by having bluffs and forcing villain to call? Or am I building a condensed range that is protected by my nuts where villain is incentivized to bet himself and I just sit there with my nuts and collect the money? Or he's not betting and then the other part of my range like my random mid pairs they get to show down cheaply and are happy about that and yes we've learned with lots of lots of splits are necessary in those spots and as i just described before it's always important to know the corner stones of your range it's just that the queen ate deuce again i I know I bet small with my pocket queens and my pocket eights. I know I do the same with queen 10, queen jack, where I check with them. Like I mix that a little. And then I start checking on the turn. And I know that is my, like just freaking queen jack is my call down hand. No matter what. If villain has ace queen, that's correct, right? But I will find out the ones that are bluffing then. then i can add like i have enough bluff catchers any random eight seven or whatever i can i can decide to bluff catch or not but i want to have like my certain cornerstones that help me to navigate through same thing ace king four most of you like to bet a little too often we're like hey we have king x-axe. That's not three street value hands. So we need to check at some point. And taking aces and kings as the lookalike protection things should help. Just knowing that we're like being there the third time in a row on the river with freaking ace-eight and hopefully making the fold again. Just knowing, well, if villain is bluffing, he doesn't have an ace. That means that you have aces not often, but like quite sometimes. And then you know your database and do not remember a single bluff you have seen in those spots, the last million hands, and then you feel good again. So it's just that knowing that, especially in those where there is a follow-up plan. And next time, I'm not sure whether I will make a video out of that, or I'll just keep it for the next community coaching to continue here and then talk about turn play but i will split that up into well we did that small villain calls and then we need to really polarize on the turn and start things or we are in the check and reaction game tree i think this this will will be lots of stuff anyways so yeah and yeah checking range we talked about that i think uh summarize that our betting ranges all the ends fitting to sizing lookalike add-ons pretty much the same way we did for the examples here queen a deuce or the perfect example and your answers were perfect as well and i guess that's it and now i'm happy to read through the last question so maxi's asking sorry to bring up the same topic again i'm trying to see where the difference is from playing a three-bet pot out of position to three-bet pot in position. How would the coaching have changed if the topic were playing three-bet pot in position as aggressor? Can you maybe give some other examples in the Ace-King-Five where we see big differences between in position and out of position? It's really just mainly the sizing. Well, first of all, it's not tough to talk very generally about that because like three bet in position, I have to put big blind versus small blind away. Range looks very, very, very different. All the examples we have looked at were now small blind versus button. That is a linear range, right? Just the top X percent of our range, because I'm playing without a flatting range in the small blind. And then, well, what can we compare that to? Could be, let's say, cutoff versus middle position. I'm doing the same. I'm in position with the linear range. That's stronger. That's a stronger range, but still the same thing. So what is happening now? The only difference is, well, ranges look a little different, but then it's position. And that positional disadvantage leads to just taking that into account. We put the same pressure on villain if we use smaller sizes. Plus, to kill that positional advantage, villain is incentivized to not float that much. By calling, he's incentivized to play way more aggressively. And once the money is in the middle, there's no positional advantage anymore. So out of position should check raise way, way, way more, which again, kills our incentive to bet big. There will be a big, big, big difference between boards where a villain should check raise a lot. Then we will only use small sizes in position. Like queen eight deuce, perfect example, we will never bet big in position. Queen nine deuce, queen ten deuce, even less. We want to keep the stack to pot ratio because we will both improve over time and then the position is just doing wonders for us. On something where villain is not check raising a lot, he's not trying to to kill position advantage. Can be low board, like five, two, two's. Villain is not having a shit. This is where we do the same. Like we are not scared of check raises. I mean, not scared at all. We have the big advantage, but we want to pressure villain's nuts now before he sees more cards. Villain's not nuts, but best hands, like his pocket nines, pocket tens. And we start betting big on those boards. So I'm not sure. I hope you have seen that. Maybe double check on that. I made a video on three bad pots in position already, how I split that there. I only use quarter pot, maybe some exceptions with 10% and mainly half pot as the bigger size and explain there how I think about different board types where we need to deny more equity, where it's more about charging nuts right now. And yeah, so I hope that answers the question a little, but a very good question, actually. So just look at the cashier's three-pad pot in position. Yes, that's out. Can you elaborate on how your hands decides which part of the villain's range you are targeting? Well, that is the part where we talked about nuts right now, or nuts, well that's over time don't need to attack anything it's like whether they check or small but but nuts nuts now but not later try to attack that that has a chance to outdraw us and so if i have pocket jacks on 10 high i want to fold out king x queen x and ace x as much as possible and i want I want to to play versus 9x or 10x was it 10x and 5x right just the random peers because whatever happens against those i'm having the freaking nuts and so actually villain has if i have tens and here let's i have to stick to one board i have two in mind right now so let's go back to the nine five deuce but But I have tens on 9-5-2s. I want Willen to call eights. He has two outs. That's it. I want him to fold king-queen. There he has six outs. That's different. King-queen has probably 25% equity. Pocket eights has 8% equity. So this is what I mean with what I want to navigate through. And we will see that we'll be on the turn a little more where we see what that leads to because that the big bet will lead to some turn jamming. Where on the one hand we are betting, let's take the nine five juice and the turn is the freaking six that brings a double flush draw. Then we will do something like just overbet jamming our tens now for maximum protection against something like king, queen flush draw. But at the same time, we will jam something like ace, king, none of the flush draws because villain is in theory forced to call his ace, queen, high flush draw. And then we have like good effects where we can still build certain ranges. So this is what I mean with what well, we really need to try to look at certain hands and what their benefit of a certain bed size is. All right, great. Yeah, let's wrap it up here. So actually I planned that as a shorter session, but now we're 90 minutes in as always. So I hope you enjoyed it. I will probably open up the thread. So feel free to give me a feedback there, how much you like, like more quiz in there, the examples examples whatever help me to to make the next community sessions even better and yeah then see you in the chat i want to have more traffic in the cash game section again so geduldbitter our winner today wants to have a great discussions and i'm happy to take part there and yeah have a good one guys until next time and girls see you johanna
