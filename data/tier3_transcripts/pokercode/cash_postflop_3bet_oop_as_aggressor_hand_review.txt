### TOPIC: cash postflop 3bet oop as aggressor hand review
 All right guys welcome to the little praxis part here. So what I just did was playing a session and I tried to focus on those spots where I get into a three bet pot as the aggressor and I'm out of position. So I don't know I played like 40 minutes I guess something something like 500 to 600 hands and now I just looked up I did three bet out of the blinds 40 times or something like that and found like seven spots I guess where I've actually seen a flop which well that seems a lot of fault equity at first I'm not sure about those numbers but let's not worry about that so what I just want to show you is just a very very typical session so you see the spots coming up this is very important. It doesn't come up too often but it will be your standard spot when you play from the small blind and all the decisions you make there can be quite costly. We are in a three bet pot already. We will c-bet at a very high frequency. We play turns and rivers and we are potentially playing for stacks so this is a very very important spot and we want to nail things and we talked in the community coaching and now i added the little little add-on about my thought process of what i think what villains are doing wrong in there as well we clearly want to know what we are doing that is our goal we want to build our wardrobe choose our sizings well there is not one correct answer but that is up to us right where do we want to attack villain how does this range look like etc etc so now i just want to lead you through my thought process in those i still guess seven hands and we'll just see what comes up so the very first hand i have ace king offsuit in the small blind and we face an unknown limper and someone iso raises so this is a little weird already but that's not the point for now i just treat that as a button open for now it's probably a little stronger he will not iso raise something like seven five suited necessarily maybe he's over calling some low pockets but we just can't know so i go with the sizing that i try to adjust a little to the situation and we get called and get a flop that is like yeah queen queen three just a i don't know pretty brick brick or trips kind of board so my advantage having jack's king kings aces should be still pretty big villain is protected with nuts so that speaks a little against the big sizing even though tens and jacks can be like kind of have the wish to get maximum money from pocket eights now to fold out something like king jack of spades whatever so I chose that I will mainly use a small bet and maybe have some big betting here where I want to have a look at the blocker something like jacks tens maybe the king jack of spades just with the very good blockers against queen x something like that is in my mind. Ace King just goes pretty much always into my small betting range I can almost bet full range here and this is what I did. And this video is just about the flop but no one hates it more than myself if I just skip to the next hand so we'll just very very quickly go through the hand and the thought process behind there. Turn is the Jack which I expect him to call every peer on the flop and now i have a big decision to make it's diamonds we have the king of diamonds that's a good thing we have a gut shot we have an well two over cards that is i mean not really drawing to the nuts that's a question double flush draw there so it's a very very tricky board And I think the right play would be to just go direction 2e or something. Like betting half pot. Something about that. I decided to be a little fancy here. And say villain is over-folding to small bets with his pair. So I decided in-game. I think it's not a thing in the solver. I went for another quarter pot. Which, well, makes villain hate his life with five, six, sevens, and eights, which especially in that given situation, I think is the largest part of his range here. I won't fold out flush draws or anything anyways. So yeah, it's just my assumption that someone who plays 20, 18 over a thousand hands might fold his pocket sevens here right away. So I go a small sizing he calls river is another diamond I have a hand that I guess by now is a more or less mandatory jam and I just bluff slightly over pot play it pretty much like a flush so let's not discuss turned river too much you can look that up in the solver what makes sense and what doesn't it's about the flop play right it's pretty much no hit board i keep my large advantage and i build my wardrobe where i say i'm pretty much i'm betting my range most of it's small and maybe some portion big and thinking about what are my first big betting hands something like maybe something like ace jack with the ace of clubs is another good option thinking about the blockers about the backdoor equity what do i want to play against all right next one ace three suited in the small bind that's not a standard three bet against 2.5x but button is min raising which means he should be a little wider it's not good that we see his hand here now but okay who cares and yeah so i decided to be a little wider and i went with that ace three actually 100 here and yeah adjusted my sizing a little again to his open race sizing he calls and flop is eight eight deuce and here we have the first spot which i'm happy to admit where i had no clue not no clue but no clue about how to play my hand but I was far enough with my thought process that I'm like, okay, here no hit board, but everything still has equity. It's not like queen, queen something in a flush draw. It's the eight makes trips. Pretty much no one of us has many eights. So it's more like he has two over cards, I have two over cards, or I have the peers that are the nuts. So yeah, I think the best thing here out of position is to only have a large c-bet sizing. Something like half pot or bigger should do the job. And I know that I can't bet full range on that board when I don't hit anything. But, or now I had the main question of what are my weakest hands? We learned that in the community coaching. When we have a checking range, we think about the weakest hands first because we need to make sure that our weakest hands go into the check folding range. If they end up like investing money, something is wrong. And here I was not sure how to evaluate my ace three, ace high is one over card, but like an ace is not a great out, plus backdoor draw with the wheel I would have definitely checked something like a6 a7 of clubs that's my 100% checking hands and then I wasn't sure whether that is a check or queen 10 of clubs is a check or a king jack whatever what are actually the weakest hands so I think that's a little too loose but I went with a half pot this is because of the high rake I went with a half pot button and went from there on the turn and then I did not catch like a gut shot additionally now I really only have one over card that I cannot necessarily value bet for stacks so it doesn't get way weaker than that at the same time I thought about okay what about continuing when the turn is a club it's actually good to have clubs because we unblock all his floats which is hearts diamonds and spades but this year still has showdown value checking down versus king queen king jack suited that shouldn't like start bluffing all the time so i decided to check here i would always fire something like jack ten of clubs here now and he checks back river is the perfect card for me and i go for a check and most of the time check call just because the ace of clubs is like especially nice one and he decides to totally give up which is well interesting to look up but probably worth a note okay again it's about the flop evaluation nothing hits we cannot really target villain with a small sizing given his position and him always having two over cards or a peer so we need to size up here to put pressure on him and next one queen 10 of spades i guess that's not a real one because we are playing against a knit 40 bp stack. Who min raises? I wasn't even sure do I want to open up a flatting range here against a weak player or whatever. I still decided to go for a three bet with that hand. Not really too happy but I want to play it and if I decide against flatting given a decent drag in the big blind behind then that's the only option. I had mid pair. If had any reads I like checking that spot a lot here I tried to make it easy for myself because he looks like the passive type of guy who just folds or calls and checks down and whatever right it's like just I know what's happening if I bet here I don't expect him to raise too often only if he has something so I just put the small bet out there i'm actually super happy if he folds and yeah then go with a check for a fold from there on so not a big deal not too much to worry about and i don't want to open up a whole new topic now saying he had 100 bigs and what do we do on that board that would not fit into the session review here so let's take the next one we have more hands so pocket fives here it's kind of the border against a good player he's not 2.5 xing but going a little smaller so that that is a good reason for a little wider three bet range so fives should pretty much always make it and forest maybe some forest adding there i went with it and we get this flop so we talked in the community coaching about one of those, like that board type actually, that in the quiz most of you wanted to c-bet with a very high frequency, but we have learned it doesn't really make too much sense because there's not much equity to be denied. And what we want to attack is villain's naked ace-axe, his gut his gut shots stuff like that so a big sizing can make sense small sizing is not too wrong but actually we end up checking a lot here as well so one thing I actually remembered from the coaching and looking at Pio there myself was that the lowest pockets that we are having with the backdoor flush draw make a pretty nice bluff here having two outs plus the backdoor flush draw plus unblocking potential folds so I remember that I'm not 100% sure I think betting small is fine betting big is fine check folding seems a little too weak having the five of spades here so I was a little fancy and sized up here and went for the big sizing and Then on the turn which is a total brick I never have threes villains shouldn't float them against the big size. So it's really a total break questions Okay, how does my barreling range look like? Yeah, I think having spades is not too bad. I think having clubs is not really great not a not 100 sure why but it just feels like it and unblocking his snap folds is is something i like a lot villain does call king queen king jack king 10 suited maybe he has even king queen offsuit as i'm very very like convinced that he's folding that on the turn and then definitely jack 10 queen 10 and queen jack suited if it's not a spade so i like barreling my pocket fives here again with at least some frequency and i just play it the same way i play my ace king and my ace queen and potentially ace jack should be the line for the big sizing and i keep bluffing here and yeah happy that it worked out all right so again talking about the flop checking makes a lot of sense the small bet is fine because we have a nice range we hit that board well but it's not having like necessarily an effect right maybe we want to even size down our small bet to attack something like fives without a spade that villain might have sixes sevens threes whatever is left and then start polarizing on the turn if not something like king queen king jack ace five all those are great checks and we should protect them with some super nuts like pocket kings pocket aces they just fit well together there and then having a large betting range built around value hands like ace king and ace queen and having like bluffs like the one i had it and additionally some queen jack queen 10 jack 10 makes a nice split there with two very very healthy ranges where we should know right away how to navigate through the pot okay next one another ace king big blind versus middle position. Now the board is 10-6-4. It's always questionable how often people defend versus those big blind three bets with sixes and fours. How much is that a brick board? How much does he have it? Definitely it's one of the boards where no two pairs possible so all my over pairs should still be nutted in a way and yeah that means I can I can keep the pressure high and keep barreling and always the 10 gives me some additional equity because I have all the broadways gives me like add straight draws on the turn and stuff like that so that's way better than something like 9-6-4 and yeah then what I'm doing is really keeping an eye on my offsuit hands which is mainly just ace king here to use the right suits and villain will have all the suited broadways he will fold his diamonds he will float the others so having a diamond is bad here right I'm not I'm check folding with my ace of hearts king of diamonds for example but this one here i think is a fine check is a fine bet i decided that i only offer myself a bigger bet which is half pot here in my case and go from there and yeah unfortunately the turn is a very very bad one one where i never improve and then it's the question okay how do i build my range i think ace king still has showdown value checking down sometimes versus ace queen suited so i prefer to keep barreling with something like queen jack suited maybe i have obviously ace five suited hands like that and yeah it and take some of my over pairs to even strengthen my checking range to have a check raise here. So lots of checking here. Ace-King, high frequency give up. But the flop, pretty straightforward, I would say. And then I check-fall to his third pot bet. I mean, I can call sometimes once to just not allow him to go for the one and done with something like queen, jack of spades. But that's like, if we look it up, that's always kind of indifferent. It's important that I check some stronger hands here as well. All right, now hand number six, I guess. Yes, another ace king. We have freaking sauce123, Ben Salsky in the zoom 200 pool. So maybe we we made it to a video we have a decent rack flatting the hijack which is interesting already another I don't know that name maybe a little little unknown and that's the wrong stats so this Hortivalen guy and I go obviously for the squeeze quite a large size I expect him to have mainly pockets I don't want to allow sauce to enter the pot cheaply so I'm happy to put the pressure high here to not allow them to really set mine. I still get called by two of them and I'm smashing that board here. If you think about my squeezing range against under the gun plus MP flat that's aceses kings queens jacks tens already a little closer and then it's suited broadways ace king offsuit some ace queen offsuit i mean that's really that's my board right even though i mean ace king is is not nothing here so i can definitely go with the range bet and given their ranges i think i i will only bet small here obviously there's some incentive to get the money in with kings but on pretty much any card that is not a heart or an ace on the turn i can do that after betting small so my my wardrobe here was just a small range bet and go from there and yeah lucky me again they both ended up folding probably sitting on 9s and 9s and that's it. So last hand for today, ace four of clubs against a button open race against a button who apparently is called button for the win. But okay, so important to not forget those three bad bluffs. and again a pretty nice board where i think we looked at similar boards in the coaching as well where we figured out okay there we have some incentive compared to the ace king eight or what it was just every bet that folds out ace high and villain has lots of ace highs does accomplish something so it's really him folding ace eight of spades is good for our Thank you. out ace high and villain has lots of ace highs does accomplish something. So it's really him folding ace eight of spades is good for our pocket Knights let's say or for anything we are having. So a small bet definitely makes sense. Villain folding a pair would be awesome for us. At the same time villain has ace queen offsuit, potentially some ace ten queen 10 suited 10 9 suited something like four five five six the jack x that do not have clean two pair outs like queen jack jack 10 that make where when they hit a two pair i i add straights to my range that's like some kind of weakish middle middle part and that tells me okay it makes sense to use a bigger size as well. Lots of turn cards that are bad for one specific part of my range. Thinking about pocket aces and ace king here without a club mainly and that's the part that would like to use a bigger size to just keep the option alive to just jam on the eight of hearts on the turn with an overbet jam to get it in there and now the main question is what do we add to that big betting range and then some of those flush draws should make it in there quite sometimes i guess the one with the wheel draw is not the worst one just makes the turn jam if i want to do that on some cards a little little better with additional equity sometimes and then obviously we can have other other bluffs like just having an offsuit ace of clubs nine is sometimes in my three betting range I guess that makes a makes a pretty nice hand as well nice big bet and then just adding the equity hands like some queen 10 in there some 10 9 in there some ace queen some ace 10 and then we have our range together with a small betting range that is built around kings and jacks and some other king x and some other jack x and the majority of everything and then we can split that up here and i decided to have a big size and a small size my big size here was i guess 75 percent and i went for this one with that specific hand but really having the structure of my of my ranges in mind here and yeah he ended up folding again so i ended up playing without mate hands pretty much but i ended up winning most of the or like yeah most of the pots by just taking it down with my draws or bluffs or whatever so just showing this was a very very short example one session like a 45 minute session something like that seven spots where i've seen the flop way more hands where i obviously got the fold versus my three bet but all the spots i think and this is like i didn't filter for that every single spot was in a way interesting thinking about sizings on the flop about turn continuation which we will talk about maybe in the next video maybe in the next community coaching I will decide at some point and yeah I hope that was a good input to just see how I think through that spot and yeah take those as examples make up your own mind as i said there's not only one correct answer to all what we build there which sizings we want to use and feel free it's just always important that you find the reasoning for yourself whenever you have a reason to do something it will never be bad that's the main thing so good luck at the tables and maybe see you next time in the zoom 200 pool
