### TOPIC: cash postflop 3bet oop as caller
 Cool, let's just get started. And as always, I have a little guideline here. So it's a little mysterious, it seems like. But since one of the tags is actually the main decision points, I didn't want to name them. Then I want to ask you about them a little later. So what we do is a three bet pot out of position as the caller. Again, I just quickly explain the spot that everyone, even the absolute beginners know what I'm talking about. Then we'll talk about two main board types. Obviously, there are lots of exceptions and I could make like 15 different board types here as well. But we want to segregate the two most obvious board types to then talk about the main decision points. So lots of decisions in a three-bet pot are kind of easy where just something happens especially as the caller we usually don't have the initiative or you don't overtake that too often so it's more reaction game so we have pretty specific decision points that are crucial and important for the gameplay and even more crucial and important for the understanding of how the spot should work out then i think we only get to two of those that's why one slide will be decision point number three in one of the add-ons that i will make a video about if we somehow usually i always plan the session and i could fill in 90 minutes even though we only have 60 so i expect that to the case today as well. But if there is the wild thing that I actually get to decision point number three, I'm happy to just talk about that as well instead of the add-on. But that's one that we actually had a coaching to already. Then we obviously have the key takeaways to let you all go in the grind and crush those three bad parts as the caller. Again, for everyone that I say that every coaching, this is cash game examples, but still every MTT player is welcome because the logic is the same for both. Stack death will be different for lots of MTT guys in their main stage and then stuff might change. But obviously you play 100 BB, chip BB poker as well. So everyone is welcome. All right, I hope everyone is ready. I ready i am finally and yeah let's talk one second about the spot what happens we race first in someone three bets us in position and we decide to make the call out of position and see a flop so obviously i could talk a lot about pre-flop already about how to build those ranges about facing a linear range about doing this and that but mainly this is just some chart work maybe let's quickly just have a look at gto wizard to give you the spot i'm talking about to have a vast idea of what we are doing what we are working with what our range is so we have a couple of spots going on here a couple of major spots one that i would say we just combine and that should be like we open raise hijack and the cutoff three bets us we see in most sims that actually cut off and hijack as well right we could open raise under the gun and the hijack are playing three bet only and then we know exactly they have a linear range some people are slightly loser always three betting pocket nines and eights and maybe some more king queen offsuit and obviously 100% ace queen offsuit. We're not going to fold it. I know it. And it looks slightly different for MTT players when they have a calling range as well, right? MTT just means there is full pot size ante usually 100 big blinds here. This is why the open race sizing is slightly bigger. And even the first first positions have a calling range but if you just think about the red part here it's kind of the same range right it's like nines and eights are there some frequency the higher the pocket the higher frequency obviously you have aces always and the other is a little less maybe maybe a little less ace king so it's yeah a little more of a polarization effect in there, but still it represents mainly a linear range. So this is something we work with in both cases. Yeah, this is the one main spot that we are like in a random position, get three bet by another random position that is not the blinds and we decide to call. And here our calling, I'll go back to the cash for the call, hijack, three bets. And we are back and under the gun. We have some clear continuations that make a difference between four betting and calling. Some four bet only, right? Then like ace queen suited, ace jack suited, king queen suited. They can do whatever they want. And then there's the next part of being indifferent, like calling or folding. Lots of pockets pairs. This is what that size is designed for to make those pocket pairs indifferent. This is kind of what we are working with today. And this is the one part. The second big part is pretty much the same situation. Just we face the three bet from the button where this is what actually we have just seen from the MTT guys where there's lots of calling happening as well. But still, we see kind of linear range with some polarization effect, which means just not the very next best hands get three bet high frequency, but like some others that are clear like bluffs or just some range additions for board coverage, like a king seven, king six, king five suited, something like that, won't be in the linear range. This is kind of the same spot as well. And then there's a one, one, one big other spot that is small blind raising, big blind three betting. Here we see a very, very, very polarized range, offsuit ace-axe, offsuit king-axe, offsuit bullshit, suited bullshit, and not the in-between part. So this is where we see kind of different ranges ranges and that will lead to some different post-flop game just knowing okay villain plays differently right we know which pockets he has which pockets he doesn't have and so on so these are the two main spots but we'll treat them a little together today yeah back to the slides this is what we were talking about i showed it already maybe you not fast enough with reading. I want to ask you, both chats are open. Which board types? I want to split that into two general board types. So try to not go into detail at all. Just give me your ideas for two board types. One board type, two words, three words. Or just put in like board type one and give me three examples. And board type two, give me three examples. If it's a little tougher to put it into words, would love to read something favor aggressor or caller. This is already next level. I would say, right. I really want to stick to something very, very easy. Again, my example is always write it down in a way that my mom understands it, that she just needs to look at the board and knows which one it is, right? For saying favor, aggressor, or caller, my mom needs to understand ranges first. She won't. High cards, low cards, maybe Benny, you can add some examples because you're talking about the full board. What is the low card board for you? What is high card board? It's like, what is king four three? It has like two low cards, one high card, one Broadway heavy, not not very connected second low card heavy connected okay i like it so it's very specific right my mom could understand it once i explain what broadway's mean connected i i guess she will manage that so yeah broadway heavy i guess like i see as that as like king jack deuce maybe low card heavy is obviously unconnected we may just make three four five four five six all right poker bro let 6. All right, poker brawl. Let's have a look at that. King, queen, 3. Ace, king, 4. Ace, 7, news. And then for part 2, 9, 8, 7, 8, 7, 6, 10, 8, 7. This is something I can work with. And this is actually what I do. I'll just show you how I split them up personally. I'd say board type A. I actually don't name a board, but I say Willem's high cards hit, which takes into perspective his 3 perspective his three betting range but if he only three bets like offsuit part ace king for example then it's only king and ace high boards could be maybe for four bet pot as well interesting and that means that he has lots of high peers that he obviously three bets that are mainly second peers now right let's compare that to poker bro he said king's at king, queen, three. That means his ace king hits something, his ace queen hits something, his king queen hits something, his queen jack hits something. Makes it very tough for him to find bluffs now. And his strong pairs build mainly second pairs now. Here's actually third pairs like jacks, tens, nines. So you see already, I think a little about, like have that language that i think about attacking something in a way right so i know which parts he has one cards close together two cards far apart interesting right so here this is already my definition board type b for me is villains high cards miss and his strong peers are over peers this is a big difference for me because when we look at the ranges we've seen that this is the one big advantage that villain has all right let's double check that again for that very easy example villain open raises under the gun or we open raise under the gun sorry hijack three bets he three bets a linear range all the big peers interestingly on the offsuit side it's only right offsuit i always focus on offsuit because this makes frequencies asking offsuit 12 combos ace queen 12 combos if he has a full frequency king queen 12 combos here maybe like six to eight or like four to six from the offsuit side yeah this is what is important this makes his combos and then he has the peers right and on the other side what is happening to us happening to us? We never have aces. We never have kings. We rarely have queens. We don't have any offsuit shit. So what is really happening is how well do villains good peers that we don't have, how well do they do? And how is this offsuit part performing that we don't have? If we go down with the peers, the ranges are actually quite the same, right? So hijack three betting range, jacks, tens, nines. Okay. He has a higher frequency hours, jacks, tens, nines, some eights, some sevens, some sixes. Let's double check here. Some eights, some sevens, some sixes, some suited stuff, some suited stuff. So actually who is the favorite or not or how the gameplay should be those hands are not relevant for that because we cover them both interesting is again that part that we have that villain does not have that much we have more eight seven seven six six five and the lowest pocket pairs maybe that he should never three bet here so this is slightly interesting and then his offsuit part, because this is what we never have in our calling range. Ace, King, some trap calls, maybe. So this is really what I want to focus on. And this is where I said two board types and talk about what happens to those two parts. Willow's strong pairs, his main advantage. It's like, okay, Willow's high cards hit. If there's an ace high board, his kings and queens don't matter anymore for that hand. It's like yes, yes, the advantage against our jacks and tens, but we are not building a huge pot with like kings versus jacks on an ace high board. They are mainly second pairs. Board type B, Villain's high cards miss and his strong pairs are over pairs. So the other way around is like 9-4 deuce. Villain has obviously ace kings and queens that we that we usually don't have, but he has ace, king offsuit, ace, queen offsuit, king, queen offsuit. And depending on frequency and how loose people are, maybe too often. This should give you first ideas what we can attack, what we can think about that board when we think about, okay, maybe taking over initiative at some point. What are we attacking? What is our problem? What do we try to achieve? Okay, so I want to get to the three main decision points. There are lots of decision points in a three-batt pot. There's no wrong answer as long as you write a decision point, but I figured out for myself that there are mainly three that I definitely want to understand and not mess up. I actually wrote down four on that next slide, but again, question to you, if you only come up with one, that is fine. Just drop it out in the chat. What are your decision points? Just think about anything where you struggle to make a decision. That's usually a very good decision point. Really where you sit there, do I do this or do I do that? And you think about your whole range. That perfect what are the main decision points jonathan here we go check race against seabed very interesting right let's just call it continuation maybe versus seabed do we call do we race do we fold but we face a seabed and we have to keep going that's a freaking good decision point to have it's one of the three we are talking about today. Poker bro flop facing a bet, actually check raise against a c-bet or I call it building a check raising range is decision point number one. That's the most often one just facing that. But the calling part is not interesting because once we know what we are check raising, it's probably like the next good stuff we are calling. And then there's like a threshold between call and fold. That depends on the sizing, but that's not the one that is really interesting and tough because we're talking about zero, zero EV stuff. Blob facing a bet, turn facing a second barrel is actually on the next slide, decision point number two or three. There's one that I like kind of put out a little. Yeah, this is the second one. Willem does lots of range betting, especially especially on those high card boards and we often just call or build our check raising range first decision point and then he starts polarizing on the term and we start to go really on bluff catch mode or not right in hero fault mode and this is a crucial decision point right a very very crucial one to play that well this is decision point number two and then nevermore actually coming up with decision point number three i wanted to talk about today and then decided that it's probably too much to squeeze it to one hour so we will have that in that add-on video that i will have it ready this week and you will probably get it by next week so a broke turn or bit is usually the knot right with like one off here or not after check check flop exactly it goes check check we have a decision to make which sizings to use and actually for the long-term members we had an awesome coaching regarding that or i enjoyed it a lot i just had a look before preparing that session again with the code with like lots of examples with lots of over betting with lots of small betting so if you want to check that especially like i will do an add-on regarding that and like a short version but we have an extended even 90 minute coaching on probing deer in a three-bet pot so this will cover that very well and mark comes up with the actually number four point that i prepared for today is the donk but the check race we have have already is the dunk I put that in there because it is an option and maybe I shortly explain when it makes sense but yeah usually there are no boards where we absolutely need the dunk EV wise and usually people are over seed betting on lower stakes so yeah I think actually I like and want to recommend to all of you to just play check only and see their action first okay so actually you came up with everything and here i said number one went chronologically donking i'm not really probing should be number three here so donking is obviously the first action on the board like five six seven maybe just quickly looking at it here five six sevens we have it we have seven it. We have 7, 8, 7, 6, 5, 6 in that spot. Villain has some of that, but not really. So maybe 5, 6, 7 shifts equity in a way. His overcards do not hit. So we want to put pressure on them instead of giving ace, king, ace, queen, king, queen a free card. So let's have a look what happens on a board like that. There's some dunking. But it's like there's not really a hand that absolutely needs to do it and once villain is c betting too much we just check race instead right even though we don't which means our checking range is weaker than it is when we check everything villain should only see that 40 so if we check full range villain should only see that like 25 maybe we see them see betting Jacks and 10s and Queens and Kings very high frequency. This is why I personally, as an exploit for lower stakes, definitely go against the donk. It is only offered to tiny donk. We could offer a big one as well. Pio obviously manually putting it in, but this is something we won't use. This year makes those offsuit hands indifferent. This is our goal. And then we deny their free card to hit a nice top pair top kicker. So this is the option, but I don't want to discuss that today because it's just bet and call is kind of the same like check, check as the follow up then. It just has the benefit of denying equity from those overcards. Okay, so let's get to the checkraising strategy. And today I tried to put in lots of strategy in easy words without making infinite examples, right? This is something I can do in the add-ons, play a little on GTO wizard drills, or just come up with some examples and explain that in detail. I think for the coaching, it's a little better that we just really have the big picture, what is the goal. And now just tell me, I'm not asking what is correct. Tell me how your check-raise strategy in three bad pots looks like. What is your check-raise sizing? And maybe a small explanation of how your check-raising range looks like. Do you make differences? Do you have something crazy like multiple sizes? I don't know. Like just write me anything. This is your chance to get involved and I will comment on that. Obviously, I'm just asking for what you are doing. There is no right or wrong. So don't be scared. This is your chance to get the direct comment on improving something. And then I just show you how I do it or pretty much what GTO Wizard recommends and why that is the case. I hope I can give the explanations then. But really having a look into what we are actually doing first helps the understanding quite a lot. So Luke, I check raise 50% sizing on connected ports if I not block draw or 33% if I block some of draw odds. Okay, so just making a slight difference how much you need protection a little. So little bigger size on board number two, smaller on board number one. Poker Pro says on one is bigger. So villain high cards hit, let's say like a king nine deuce board, you go bigger. And on like a eight three deuce board, you go smaller. Okay. Can you try and describe your check raising range which hands you choose to three bet in like very easy words so you don't need to make a list of like mid set bottom set backdoor draw but like very very easy what range you're going with right raising vulnerable nuts or nuts that unblock his continuation hands for example middle set right very often we are not check raising top set because that blocks the top pairs. We need them to hit something else first. Middle bottom set are the ones we usually always go with. Perfect. In live cash, I choose different sizing for certain types of players. Your player tendencies, absolutely. For example, when you know what is their first point where they fold their pocket pairs. let's say do they fold jacks and queens on king nine deuce against a certain sizing if we plan to barrel it off we probably want to keep them in one more street maximize value then get them to fold are they like never ever holding ace king then against that it doesn't matter and so on very good point so jonathan i guess i usually do not check race on board a alone because i feel villain is protected and cannot make a mistake of c-bet too wide right this could mean that you shouldn't check race wider than gto wizard as a bluff but still if villain plays correctly by just c-betting everything you should answer by well check raising correctly exactly copying g right? So actually, even though he doesn't make a mistake, you just let him over-realize that actually you not check-raising is still a mistake, whatever he does. So yeah, you should just follow the perfect answer, even though he plays perfectly. Okay. Check-raise small on board two to deny equity to overcards with merged range and still able to go all in by turn rubber check raise larger on board one to full rise with two pair sets nape lee you can take over this is the next slide this is exactly what we want to do so i want to present to you pretty much two plans two main strategies and this is maybe nape lee's words are even better than mine i said board type a i call it just the high card boards. And with high card, I just mean villains, offsuit bluffs, or like the offsuit part of his three betting range hits. Hijack versus under the gun. This is more only king and queen high and obviously ace high. If we are going button versus cutoff, it's more like jack high as well. Maybe even 10 high. Just showing what I mean with that that so i don't want to give too many board examples because i like to keep it like that to cover all boards right if we have cut off and it's bottom three bet he covers ace hand a little but really the offsuit part matters jack high here is pretty pretty strong for in position so that counts as a high card board in that instance if we are under the gun versus hijack and this i want to show this year a jack is worth nothing right so we just don't care about the suited part this year is three combinations once there is a jack and this year is like nine combinations when there is a queen like each of that so just combination wise very very very important give their Jack-high board and we attack ace-king, ace-queen, and king-queen. All right. And there, we have a pretty clear plan for board type A, high card boards, that we say you have it and we start attacking middle strong stuff because once they hit their offsuit part, there is no nothing. Sure, on king-nine deuce, they still have their still have their ace five suited but i said suited so it's not really a range part it's like a couple of hands so yeah they hit quite often their ace king off it's something their king queen hits something but they now have queens jacks 10 and obviously they have jack 10 suited queen suited, and ace-queen-off suited still as well that's still around. But we want to see how it changes from like range parts. So we are more attacking the part that already has something. And to attack that, we need a bigger sizing. And here, it's a good idea to start kind of linear, right? Our range is built around sets and strong hands. And then mix and draws something that can beat villains nuts at some point. Let's just quickly have a look at how that strategy looks like i did not prepare that and i hope i don't get killed here by a gto wizard with different sizings now and let's say check we have an easy range bet for in position here let's choose the 33 one and we build check raising range, which is anything low frequency, even ace king. Ace king is like, yeah, the third barrel we get called by ace king and maybe some king queen. It's not like clear value value, right? So our clear value value is pocket deuces, unblocking everything, and pocket nines. And that's pretty much it, right? And we small sizing the small sizing in gto wizard is 35 the 55 is about with those sizings about the 3e sizing right it's about linear sizing directional in where we know already on a turn brick we have a plan we usually stick to the sizing plan go directional in with nines and deuces and add the best draws that we are having while here some blocker play with a very rare frequency jack nine suited we have nine eight attacking tens jacks queens queen ten suited queen jack suited so on is like some whether you want to call it merge in my opinion it's just a bluff which is a nice five altar and we have like back doors like that that's interesting right and obviously the nut gut shots queen jack queen 10 jack 10 they should go in that range sometimes right so we take the bigger sizing of the two that are relevant here villain already has a problem with tens and jacks this is what i mean obviously they fold their ace highs but i always look at what do we give trouble to those hands that are indifferent. Interestingly, that is king queen as well. And king queen is a zero EV call fold. I guess everyone calls that at least once, but yeah, Jack's tens are zero EV and obviously other pockets as well, if they are even zero EV. Cool. And then quite obviously we have the plan. If I talk, we go linear directional and it's clear what happens on a non-board changing card. We use 55% sizing on the flop. This is half pot on the turn. If we decide to keep going, we take all our nuts pretty much. And then the best available bluffs. Ace-Axe is blocker-wise already the best river bluffs, I would say. Then Jack-10 is because it has some equity. Like Ace-4 with the nut gut shot, obviously. And the Ace-3 being like a blocker, great two-outer. And the three outs to an Ace are not too bad either. But the half pot is pretty clear. And the river put out another break. Five is not a break, but is an all-in, which is again 50%. So you see a very clear sizing plan. 55% flop just because it's offered here. 50% turn, 50% river. We are all in. This is the beautiful example of linear sizing directional in. And this is what we chase with that. We make a standpoint at the flop. We start representing nuts. We can see how that changes on maybe a queen. What do you think? What changes regarding the turn sizing on i take the offsuit queen any guess how it changes size down everyone in for size down let's type in a one for size down and a two for same plan luke for the two camsi for the two jonathan for the one benny for the one pokebro for the one so even even even even so reasoning for a size down would be that we cannot value bet the value hence we plan to value bet for stacks anymore meaning pretty much we plan mainly to check raise deuces and nines directional in and the queen changing nuts that way that we cannot value about that for stacks anymore i say we can so i think we stick to the same plan. We just added Jack-10 to our nuts, and obviously Villain added partly pocket Queens, which sucks, right? But still pocket deuces have to be good enough, and Villain doesn't have too much Jack-10 suited, I guess. So actually, I think the plan stays the same on the Queen, and I would be not shocked but worried if we see any other sizing. the queen is a beautiful card and we just freaking keep bluffing with queen jack with the queen blocker and good luck mr ace king so it was a little trick question the way i asked it but we check race with a clear plan and we need more than a turn queen to change that plan we made a standpoint on the flop and it's not about our ace king that is not strong anymore. We say we have a set on the flop or we have something that will be better than aces and ace king at some point. And actually the queen helps us here. So let's double check the turn whether there's any card where we change our strategy. Okay, we see a queen is beautiful, a jack is beautiful, a ten is beautiful. It means high frequency. A nine is bad and a deuce is very bad. This is just because it kills our nuts, obviously, and doesn't help us at all. Even an ace changes things because lots of our bluffs actually have an ace. We have like some, yeah, we are not really sure what to do, but it's impossible to change our strategy. You see all the sizing, it's always half pot. So big learning here. it's impossible to change our strategy right you see all the sizing it's always half caught so big learning here it's impossible to change our strategy there for 100 big blinds we just react to the amount of nuts we're having our amount of nuts decreases on the deuce decreases on the nine here we cover that with some jack nine suited that we should have nine eight suited and we have like another part added on eight on an ace this is because it's slightly different or why it's slightly different 200 bb d the size down would be okay i think we plan already differently on the flop we won't go 3e on the flop for 200 bix we are pretty much making it a four street game and splitting slightly different i can give it a quick look but this shouldn't be the focus ranges are slightly different already different open race size, three batting, maybe slightly different. I can give it a quick look, but this shouldn't be the focus. Ranges are slightly different already, different open race size, three betting, maybe slightly different calling. Anyways, let's just stick to the ranges. We have this year as the under the gun range. That is quite similar with a little more board coverage, I would say. Queen's number four betting. And we have under the gun still C betting a lot. And then us betting 60 55 that's the same here i guess maybe some bigger but just less i would say and then it's like about deuces interesting let's see 39.5 that's the 75 is that going directional in with deuces i'm not really sure let me see what's left now we got 130 in the middle 135 left river is a brick it's close to rip deuces it's close so it's like yeah we need that block bed not block but like we split on the river slightly and only polarize with like queens plus so yeah we don't take the turn size down it seems like we want to keep range together we see like some but that's an outcome of our range on the flop but very good question right to think about that stuff and learn from it okay so now we learned that that we have a very very very very easy plan here one more example maybe for a different type of board ace six five which is actually an absolutely cool board for out of position that in position shouldn't see that too much we check now villains kings queens is not worth a lot anymore he doesn't go like full c-bet range but again if he c-bets we build only our 55 range we build it around fives sixes five six ace five backdoor straight plus two outer to set backdoor straight plus two outer to set backdoor straight plus two outer to set and there we go and the one pairs here that have like good stuff going for them again 50 we attack kings queens jacks right now ace queen right now you see how you can fold all that shit that's insane you get the call turn choose a card let's take a bad card we go 25. Well, we see some slight size down here with a king. That's interesting because our two pair sucks now. This is the one, the one that changes in value. Five, six, and ace, five changed in value. This is why we create that sizing plan that is not going all in. If it's any other card, pretty much a 10, we stick to our sizing plan. So size down is only a thing when parts of like a huge chunk, bigger chunk of our value range is decreased value now. Cool. Okay. So very easy, very clear plan. Very easy to remember. Now the second one, and some of you talked about it already. It's board type B, low card boards. What I did for a long time is just using one check raise size in three red pots. I know there's a German saying, and I know there's a Chinese saying, but I don't know a good one for English. Maybe someone has the translation for mit Kanonen auf Spatzen schießen. Yeah, it's like taking a cannon to shoot a little bird. So this is what we are doing here. This is board type B. The definition of that was that villain either has an overpair, which usually is not folding, or villain has over cards, which obviously is a freaking six outer to no nuts, like an ace king on a nine four three, like an ace queen on 10 four deuce. Is a queen equally bad since people probably not start folding ace queen? Chevy, which board are you talking about? Still the king nine deuce? Oh, you're talking about the ace six five. Yes, absolutely. Parts of your value range are ace five and six five. Four combinations total. So now they got fucked. So you have one part that's like sixes fives and a smaller one that needs to attack something else. Using a slash hammer to crack a nut. That, I love it. All right. So now this is the spot where exactly we want to attack only those over cards right so we don't want to take a sledgehammer we don't want to take a cannon we just take maybe a little knife and work around with that the hyena schlachtmesser oh great jonathan loving it so right then we take a little knife like not the hyena schlachtmesser not the cannon We take like a little knife and really only try to tackle this ace king, ace queen offsuit that missed and give Willem therefore more trouble. If he folds and we bluffed, we had an incredible risk reward to get him to fold. If he calls with a hand that is not even drawing to the nuts, might be drawing to a top here and we have set already, well, that has a big big downside as well so what we can do is actually to put hands into our range that actually don't want to give that free card to ace king queen there will be quite often an ace king or queen on the turn well there are 12 ace king queen in the deck let's say villain has ace king ace queen there's like nine of those cards left or 10 of those you can only cover two cards still happens quite often. 20%, we see this card and then we sit there with our pocket jacks on 10-4 deuce, right? But since we only want protection against those, we want to deny their equity or charge them because we are ahead. We actually are indifferent whether they call or fold. Both is good for us. We want to go for actually the mint check raise. GTO wizard is slightly over the mint check raise. If you run the same sim in Pio and offer a mint check raise, this is the preferred one. Let us have a look at something where that happens quite often. It's not that much in like early positions because their villain is just very, very well covered with the overpairs and is fast playing a little back and then can bluff some ace king, which we can see as an exploit that we can still raise because this is never going to happen but we could say something like a nine three or villain should only half pot or 75 on the flop we have learned that in a couple of coachings already right with the half we have the 75 no one hits anything we sit on sevens eights tens jacks he wants to put pressure on that So let's say he bets half pot and we see the pocket threes. We don't see the nines. They want villain to hit a king or ace. And what we see is exactly what I wrote down in your vulnerable value. Pocket queens. We play a pot of, what is it? 14. Pocket nines is value. They have a value of 48 big blinds right now, right? Just expecting lots of money going in the middle. Pocket queens have a value of 11, not even the full pot, but still raising is not the superior play, but as good of a play, right? Why is that the case? Well, you see like 17-4. If you put it in PIO, min raise is the best option. We see here why? Because we want to make them actually indifferent, right? So ace-king here depends on the suit. If you unblock the back doors and you have a state it's indifferent and the others are a clear fold, even though all of them have zero EV. So actually we could go smaller and they are still zero EV. So this is our goal. Obviously we still have this snap fold part here and we maximize our value against something like pocket jacks and tents. And maybe what I like doing is really looking at the EV here because this reflects our feeling. Often we get check raised on that board. We have pocket jacks. We feel very, very bad. And we see that the call EV here is already only six. We're like, we have 30 big blinds in the middle already. It's not like we are really winning a lot. We are fighting against losing all of it. This is it. Board type two where that happens way more often is blind versus blind. Small blind, big blind, wider ranges, more equity to be denied. Double check, offsuit part, ace queen, ace king, king queen, ace jack, and all this shit as well. And it's easy to get those to snap pull. So let's say we let king eight, queen eight, queen nine, jack nine all miss, which means we go for a seven high board and then have a look at what's happening. So check, we have the large, mainly large c-bet. And then we have a beautiful check raise with mainly the small sizing, right? Some pocket eights, nines actually go for extra protection to be able to really fold out everything. But yeah, even the low pockets, fours, fives, it's not that they are value, but they play better with equity denial. So A7, something like that, all go for that small sizing. Seven, six can go for that small sizing. And we don't have a clear plan. Here I wrote reconsider turn because on lower boards, the turn card changes everything. Whether the turn is a five or a or a king it's a different spot i want to have a look at that let's have a look at the random king oh after check raising we go for the range check i didn't hear this is what i showed before where the strategy is always the same what happened here bet oh sorry you called sorry i want to re-raise oops you re-raise he calls and the king won't be a range check but still there will be big variation that's almost a range check it's fine enough that i didn't make a fool out of myself that there's very very different strategies for each card because we just played the flop and left stack to pot ratio as high as possible with our close to min check raise because we only had one goal get rid rid of his shit. Now think about it. If Villain for example is value heavy, this does not make sense. If he does not have his queen 9 offsuit, like the part of checkraising pocket 8s that really wants to do that is irrelevant. If Villain actually has like ace king, ace queen, and aces, kings, queens, jacks, tens, nines, well then maybe we rather go for a big sizing with our sets and so on so it's really here what is the actual range and what can we attack and then seeing that as the tough plan maybe focus on that when studying a little more that we absolutely need to reconsider the turn i showed you the turn for this year it was very very very easy okay this was actually lots of information actually like i broke down with a very smart guy. I work a little one-on-one together with to just come up with that. And I played poker for over 10 years now, and I think it was not never that clear. And that easily explained to me with those two main strategies, just focusing on villains of support, what we are actually attacking. And now it seems super, super easy for me to just use two check raise sizes exactly to my needs, knowing what I'm attacking and already having a clear turn plan. In the other, needing to be a little flexible. All right, on board two, if the king comes on the turn and out of position checks, does in position attack us a lot with small size? Actually, it will be a mix, I think. But he has incentive to attack us with a bigger size as well, because we have lots of medium strong value. If we check raise pocket eights, pocket nines on seven, deuce three, and the turn is a king, and he has a king, he wants to go linear against medium strong hands. So I would say something like a king wants to go half pot or whatever is linear, just have look, would be my guess, but small cannot be wrong because we will have bluffs that give up, that have equity against him. Like if he has a seven himself, for example, while it's always the vulnerable value hands or like thin value hands that plan to check back go small and the super nuts go small. Aces can go small, right? Kings can go small and then jam river and something like a king or even like a jacks and queens Thank you. back go small and the super nuts go small aces can go small right kings can go small and then jam river and something like a king or even like a jacks and queens i would expect them to go slightly bigger let's have a look here we can figure that out quickly we check okay it puts it together without the small bet betting how much do we have in the middle 60 already that's really big 20 into 60 and then it's almost linear yeah 20 into 60 call and then 50 into 100 left it's like a mix between small and the linear one like it's like the linear one shifted a little into the cheaper direction and maybe some ants that need max protection actually go for the 50 like an ace king being nuts right now maybe okay so on paper it should work more versus people with very high 300% because they have more air. Yes. I wouldn't say it works because we don't have a clear goal. We are indifferent whether they call or not, but it performs way better compared to the call. Because when we call pocket eights and villain has all the king nine offsuit, queen nine offsuit, he will realize 20% equity. And for a cheap min-raise, you fold 20% equity out of that pot. That's a big success. Okay. I hope that answers those two questions. And then I'm just jumping to the next. Different turns on the exact size on board two would be interesting to look up. Would be going too deep. Actually, I think best case is here to play a little GTO wizard and maybe I'll do it, or I probably will do it as an add-on. I show you a little how to work with that. And then we see that, right? We need to be so flexible with exact ranges then that it's actually tough to make guidelines. I don't have them myself. So that's a spot where I struggle every time I play because it's just like, so it's like, what does he have exactly? What do I try to deny? And so on. It's like not as the other one that it's a crystal clear thing we are trying to achieve. Great spot to look deeper into. So here, now giving you a plan. You learn something very easy, high card boards, check raising strategy, execute, crush. Board type B, understand, try, right? And have something to learn, right? And that counts not only for you, but for me as well. Okay, let's get to decision point number two. And now this is the facing double barrel. I want to do that in paint a little. I have an image in my head. I think we work like that for a big blind. Defending as well here, it's the same as well, right? So here you see, I wrote down three range parts in my head. So the spot is the following. Quickly lining that up. Let's go to the tighter ranges to have like more clearance there as well. And we say king, nine, deuce, check, small c-bet. We decide to call. We have ace, king. We have king, queen. We have queen, jack. We have queens and jacks. Call. Turn is an absolute bullshit. Brick, check. Villain starts polarizing using this size or this size. It's like in between. Let's say he bets 75%. We sit there with queens. We sit there with jacks. We have a bad feeling with king-10 already and so on. And we need to continue. Okay, sometimes we even have raises, right? Maybe there's, if I put a flush draw out there, but we have three parts. We have clear continuations. We have snap folds and we have love catchers. And I visualize that like that. I go for a little rectangle here. Villain chooses a certain sizing. His sizing forces us to defend a certain part of our range. In the rectangle, you see our range, but this here is his sizing, forces us to defend if we don't want to let him overbluff. Let's say he bets 75%. So we need to defend maybe everything in that orange rectangle, like an orange and black would be like maybe 60% of our range. And I want to represent the three range parts like that. Snap fold is here. Snap continuation, like clearly not thinking about it is here. And minimum defense frequency is just a little math that does not get absolutely close because there's one more street to play. But like in your eyes, it is this it's like if we do it villain risks let's quickly do the math 75 to win a full pot of like his bet plus the pot so it needs to work 42.8 to give him like a profitable bluff so that means that we would need to defend 57.2 but i guess we are allowed to defend a little less because it's a very good board for villain. Let's say bet 18 and oh, actually that's very close. 56%. Yeah. Okay. That's cool. Right? So actually we need to defend a little more because villain, even with his loss has slight equity. If he has ace high, that's good enough for some equity. So I think this is actually some overfolding regarding equity, but it's not necessarily the exact math from minimum defense frequency. This is just understanding the spot, but yeah, I give it a yes now. So now I want to represent all the combinations we're having with stars. It's not that many because we have a very tight range. We know king nine deuce, we check all the flop with whatever, and I have like an easy fold now. Jack, 10 is folding. Queen, 10 is folding. Queen, jack is folding. Whatever else is folding. And we have clear continuations. We have ace, king, not going anywhere. King, queen, not going anywhere. King, jack. Like I call those like value calls. We're not necessarily grazing for value here. Maybe we grab pocket nines on the flop. Then we can think about value. We're definitely continuing. It doesn't mean like that right side is stronger than left side within this box. Just here, we're doing that. And then actually there is lots of hands that Willem tries, and this is how he chooses his sizing actually, that they are around that line, that they are around zero EV, right? If Willem bluffs correctly, they should be here. Like they don't know. know they just don't know and then we have some bluff catchers that are slightly better than the others and some that are slightly worse okay so now we sit there with mainly we have one decision that is which value or continuation like clear continuations which one to raise often this is a check jam decision on the turn in a three bet pot. So we have to make like the raise decision. Let's represent that a little like that, whatever, right? We need to split it up into call and raise. Definitely not 50-50, but just represent like that. And then there is this whole bunch of things. We sit on a random pocket pair. Is Willem bluffing ace, queen, ace, jack? I don't know, right? Is he doing this or that too often? Is he going all the way with all the ace fives and i'm catching him this time sucker i think everyone knows this feeling that we have big decisions with those and usually we hate those decisions because if villain plays somewhat good this year is the exact line of zero ev he makes our bluff catchers indifferent now what is the correct this is the decision point i want to talk about. This here is actually what I want to focus on. How do you make your decision with those bluff catchers? Any ideas? Or how do you do it in-game? Overfold and give my money to bluffs. Here we go. Okay. Loving it. So actually, let's say orange is actually like the theory defense line. And let's say red now is the actual defense line or the actual EV line for us right so you're saying you just fold all of them gives villain great ev for his bluffs or you just call all of them and give him great ev for his value or i see it like that that this here is pretty much a scale between villain being value and bluff heavy right and this year actually i should combine that this is EV line. And if villain, let's say we have a bluff heavy villain, then all of those yellow bluff catcher stars might actually be on the right side of this line and all be plus EV. If villain is super value heavy, all our yellow stars on the left side. We cannot know. This is the guessing game that's killing us inside. A lot of natural bluffs, tragic, valued, value, bad ratio, villain. Think about about the river too if he over bluffs or not right information information information is key cams and discord i mainly think of our closed love catchers and swing one way depending on villain's tendencies villain tendencies tendencies tendencies we have one more street to play which is the river where obviously if we know all the tendencies and i pretend often that i I know something, but I have no clue, right? Against most players. So one thing that I'm trying is, right? Really have that there in your mind. Either a villain is playing like this and all bluff catchers are minus EV, or he's playing like this and all are plus EV. That's the most common spot we are finding. No one is playing like this would be GTO, and then the best ones are slightly plus and the worst ones are slightly minus. And actually we should just only care about frequency or in the moment, it actually doesn't matter what we are doing. So now what we need to be doing is that we rank them because we like to react emotionally. But what would be the worst thing in the world that could happen is that we end up holding our best love catcher, like best on the very right, our strongest hand, and call our worst. Because maybe between those, there's one or two BB difference, small equity difference. And this is for me very, very important that we look at this group and kind of give them a ranking, right? That we say catcher number one, what is our best catcher? Catcher number two, catcher number three, catcher against seeing face up bluff, right? Like last catcher, like to really find our reasoning, which catcher is slightly, slightly, slightly, slightly better. That can be something as bullshit as we open raise hijack, big blind three bets. It's a different spot, but I like the example that I prefer to call pocket sixes for set value and not pocket fives. Anyone has the reason for me? MP versus big blind three bet. I like calling sixes for set value, but not 5s. Who has the reason for me? Unblocking ace 5, right? Exactly. Villain is bluffing ace 5. I want him to have a bluff, actually. Or he blocks my sets. Both doesn't help. I want to flop a set and usually the standard villain never has a 6 in his bluffing range. So on average, I will hit a set like 1% more often, 0.2% more often. I don't care. So the small differences are the case. And now I want to do that with you. So now we have a list of bluff catchers. I give you the list, actually. I say value bluff catchers, this part that we cannot fold. I said ace king. I said king queen. Like everything that has very, very reasonable EV. Like king queen here shows eight big blinds EV. King 10 a bluff catcher but it blocks a king that's freaking good right or villain could have some merge that checks back river that we beat are just very very very good obviously pocket nines are in here as the super nuts we are not freaking folding that and now we have bluff catchers and those are our stars here here in this spot it's not many we have queens we have Queens, we have Jacks, we have nine eight suited, we have 10 nine suited. We actually have like a few percent of nine seven suited that someone misplaced pre-flop, I guess. And then I counted them out already. Let's put them in there. Now I gave it away, but we have tens, eights, sevens, all very low frequency flop continuations. I want you to give me a list, right? Let's's put those together. Those are really shit. They are 100% folds. I help you. Those are all the last in our list. But I want you to rank those here. Make it number three, number one, number two, number three, combine them or not. I want you to come up with a list. Tell me which one is the best of those block catchers. This is often a good idea because some of them will be the same, but you should be able to tell me which one is the best and which one is the worst. That's a very good start. Board is King of spades, Nine of hearts, Deuce of clubs, Three of diamonds. At 33% block, 75% turn. Okay, Poker Bros, starting with 9897, seven then pocket jacks pocket queens now the other way around pocket queens then pocket jacks someone else best to worst nine eight suited or spades not sure nine seven of diamonds pocket queens pocket jacks ten nine suited i think like and queen queen because we block king queen maybe not queen queen because we block ace queen might even out's tough. 10, 9 suited because 10 out is dominated by king, 10, which villain only has suited, only low frequency. So we are really talking about tiny, tiny things here. So we see it now two times. We see the 9, 8, 9, 7 on top. Can someone explain to me why 9, 8 and 9, 7 are indeed the by far bluff bluff catcher by far best bluff catchers in that spot clean two pair odds here we go right we have catcher number one 9-8 suited 9-7 suited and just in gto wizard language they have plus 1.9 big blunts villain needs to really under a bluff that we make bad. Blockers are a small issue as well, but mainly we have five outs against villain's main value range. Five outs, which means 10% to even beat his nuts. Like not his kings, but still 10%. Catcher number two is 10-9 suited. 10-9 suited. Same outs, but outs but slightly dominated slightly blocking blocks right it's like when we hit we beat less we beat less of that right because villain partly has queen jack villain barrels high frequency queen jack on the turn so actually that's bad if we hit that and if the river is a 10 i guess villain guess Villain might not even value that Ace-King anymore. Let me see. So really the question is Villain putting in his money if we make our hand? This is now on a 10 river. Ace-King is not really going for it, right? While on a 7 river, we get all the money from all the Ace-Kings. So this is a couple of things. What's our pure equity to beat a large chunk of his range? And then second, what are our implies? Is it obvious that we hit this card or is it not? And the clear catcher number three is here, queens and jacks are kind of even when it comes to blocker. They block more bluffs, unblock value, whatever block value, unblock bluffs kind of evens out here in that spot. Jacks are both exactly zero ev and pure frequency call right so here we had 1.9 big lines here it was like 0.95 big lines really one big line difference and here it's zero so whether you make the decision that villain again here is bluff heavy or not and all bluff catchers are heavy. None or you know perfectly where you are at. This year is ridiculous to say we know, but whenever we take the right ones first, that's 1BB better, right? If villain is like this, then this one is losing 1BB, this one 2, this one 3. If it is like this, this one is winning 3, this one is winning 2, this one is winning one. So it's about the difference in our play. We cannot know villain strategy perfectly. We cannot know whether this is likely winning or losing, but we know that one catcher is clearly better than the other. And this is something that we need to come up with as often as possible. Don't search for something that is not there. For me, the clear driving force on the turn is equity and nothing else. Equity may be slightly the implies. The turn, in my opinion, is too early to think about blockers. Blockers can be misleading because they give you reasons in the direction that you want to think. Like your jacks or like queens, what was it? Is blocking king queen? Well, but they are blocking ace queen as well, which is a high frequency block. So it's often this evens out if villain plays correctly but we use blockers on the river but not necessarily on the turn okay and really that understanding that one catcher is always one bb or so better than the other and it doesn't matter like we play one bb overall better taking this than the other whether villain is bluff heavy or not we don't care too much it's just important that those first. Obviously, if we have a read, we can still decide to pull all of them or to call all of them. Order is the absolute most important one. In the bluff catching coaching, blocker is the last read we rely on as well. Exactly. I fool myself often enough and like blocker, blocker, blocker, blah, blah, blah. No. If we jam five times pot on the river, yes, it's a good idea to have knowledge about cards, but not here when we play, not wide, because I have pretty tight ranges, but still somewhat tight for that spot. Okay. Now think about it. I want to give you something to think about. Let's do this year for a wider range. Big blind three bets against the small blind. You are in the small blind and you call. The flop is something like King, eight, four. The look checks. Let's have a quick look. Small bet. Here it's actually a mix of our two strategies, right? There is obviously a mix exists as well with those wide ranges. I would stick to the bigger one here, make my life easy and not go with too much equity denial stuff. It's about calling now. And the turn is a beautiful card for the guy in position. Let's give him a jack cards. And he decides to double barrel. This sizing, 75%. Now give me your last value call that has like very clear EV in GTO wizard. Like the king 10 from before. Something we are just not holding on the turn. Against unknowns, against people who might be under bluffing without the clearest of all reads. Maybe like this value hand, we are definitely not folding. King eight for Jack rainbow. I'm talking about out of position calling the turn. You're calling 10, nine on the flop. And then on the turn, Luke, I'm a little surprised we're in bluff catching mode. Ace Jack suited, right? So let's compare that, right? It would be easy to just say, I'm not folding a king, a top pair, which is like 11 big blinds, 12 big blinds call. Ace-jack would like having five big blinds. Ace-eight is maybe a good answer as well with 2.8 big blinds. Just any jack that we are having, jack-10, we cannot fold four big blinds. And then we have all that show. And this is a little of your homework for everyone interested. Make a list for all the bluff catchers, all the freaking bluff catchers. What about an 8x? What about a 4x? What about pocket 9s, pocket 10s that you're having? What about ace, queen? Should be ahead of bluffs and having four nut outs. So think about that. And this will help you, right? Really think of that here as a list. Make sure you call the best ones first. Here's one more thing. It's not only the equity you have against the value part, but it's against the equity against bluff part as well. Ace queen has the high risk of obviously being ahead now, but the villain might have two random cards and then binks appear on the river and we end up losing, even though we bluff catch correctly. That would suck. So obviously having a jack there, then it's way stronger if the villain has 10- seven offsuit. Yeah, that is a little homework. So decision point number three, probing. We have a huge video on that, a big coaching 90 minutes. It's on the platform in the three bed pot section. So just make sure to check that out again. I'll talk shortly about it in an add-on, pretty sure. And then we are at the key takeaways. River is always special. This is why I didn't make that an important decision point this is where we start to use blockers where we start to use most reads but if we play what we talked about today until then i think we are doing a freaking good job right out of position to roll then probe correctly as well to build a nice check raising range with correct sizings and train a little with the continuation. And we make good turn calls, right? We don't need to be geniuses and always know whether they bluff or not, but we want to know our range and put that in the right order when it comes to defending or not defending. So really for me, it's important that you know your certain rules for each decision point. Next time you set decision point number one, check raising or not. This type of work, I'm going for this strategy. That makes sense to me, right? Perfect. You know what you think about. Boom. You are aware of the decision that you make right now. I make the decision now. I think about do his offsuit broadways, do they miss or are they there, right? Do I build my check raising range with vulnerable value hands or do I go like nuts and draws only? And then understanding this, what I try to really put on the air in this coaching is to understand the strategy in simple words. I was not talking you check raise bottom set. I was not talking you take the back door. Something I say, you take nuts and draws. I say like go linear direction all in with like this. And yeah, show him you have it or not, right? You take a stand, whatever, right? And then you make a list of bluff catchers in the reaction game and sort that and try to rank them from high to low and go with that. So the way to rank catcher is based on its equity against villains and value and bluff and influence. Is this the takeaway? Well, the takeaway for the turn decision point, kind point kind of that you rank it lots of things play a role but for me the main factor is really do i have two outs like pocket jacks hitting a jack or do i have five outs like a four five suited bottom here that can hit a four make two pair or trips or five two pair and trips five outs means 10 equity to beat value and then will villain value bet this value often in three bad pots the answer is yes on those cards as well or obviously is a if a flush draw gets there he won't rip in a random top pair so that's very important and then maybe for wider ranges maybe something like ace queen seems cool ace queen high having like nut outs and so on but actually if you lose to the weakest bullshit pair that villain is betting or he might even be bluffing with a pair then it's a very bad bluff catcher all of a sudden because the idea of bluff catching is to beat bluffs that's the starting point everything else is just on top right we say okay yes bluffs he has value and it's like a little tick in that direction. If we have that 2%, 5%, 10% equity, even against his nuts. Will we do an add-on for probe the river after we call flop and turn goes check, check. It's not planned. I know there's probing in the three bet pot section as well. I think it's probing in general, but I keep it in mind. Probing, because I think this is a little outdated. These days we have lots of 10% bets in 3-bet pots especially as well, so I might see myself doing something there soon. All right, I hope you took something away and maybe one thing. What is beautiful, because you can see it in two ways, is to let you out of here with a little something cool is zero EV, mixed calls mean if both players play perfectly. I can tell you that your opponents are not playing perfectly. If you start to do that, you are allowed to call all those hands, which is more fun than folding. Enjoy crushing and then call a couple more hands. See you the next time.
