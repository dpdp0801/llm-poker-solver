### TOPIC: cash postflop 3bet oop as caller vs checkback
 All right. Hello, hello, hello. Don't want to miss the Kahoot. Plenty of quiz action today. Hey, Pavel. First one in the chat. Ellen. Wow. California. That's freaking... What's that? 7am? Good job. Hey, Jinxie. 7am. Here we go. Damn it. I just made a cough and forgot it for five minutes now. Damn it. As always, we'll wait two, three minutes to get things started. This is definitely not enough people in the Kahoot. Today is actually a very easy lesson. I was preparing yesterday night and this morning, and I was like, is it really that easy? And it's like just a couple of guidelines and that's it. So looking forward to actually just crushing it. And we have lots of quizzes. And yeah, go from there. I actually just played some Tio Trainer myself there. Hey, Philip d tom say there who have you guys played some scoop i feel like cash is underrepresented these days everyone looking for the yeah big glory in the tournaments i myself find my find myself checking out all the the pads insta stories looking up what fedor is up to what matias is doing there will we get some content for in position after defending versus Tria as well? So I'm burning money there. Best is probably if you just open up thread in the, either in the feedback or just in the cash strategy, I'm always looking to get input. There's always something next and you can influence me on what you want to see next. So we can definitely do that. So everyone check out and say hello to our friend Sebarno, because if you look clearly at his screen name, you might get an idea what we're talking about today. We need some patterns in here. All right. So make sure help, help out the people. I put the chat now on the, on the other screen. So it will be tough to follow closely because let's actually get started. And yeah, we have, as always, you can guess first one, two slides before starting the quiz. Let's just double check on what we are talking about today. As always, I like the copy paste in my PowerPoints, put some structure into it and makes it easy for me. So let's talk about what is the spot today, first of all. So the spot today is we do call a three bet out of position. So first thing to think about, hey, you tournament players out there, we play without ante. We have like big stacks, which means positional disadvantage is even bigger. So we play a freaking, freaking, freaking tight range. We still try to have some board coverage with some mixes and so on, but this is something we need to be aware of. We don't have a freaking 100% of jack-10 suited. We do not call every pocket all the the time and so on and so on so this is what we do pre-flop and then the flop goes check check now it's the turn we are talking about there is a turn card and it's on us to start the betting round this is all that happens and we'll talk about how to approach that spot let me that was not planned but just to show that because talking about ranges i guess is pretty important for everyone who is not used to the 100 bb ranges so this year is what i have saved personally got it from a friend 400 bb zoom 500 ranges and this is actually the first spot we will look at the cutoff versus mp3 bad pod and this year is the out of position calling range we're like you see there is not even a single hand a hundred percent just because it's sometimes a four bet or sometimes even a fold and so on. So we have really freaking tight ranges. We fold queen 10 suited just every freaking time. We fold queen jack suited quite often and so on and so on. So it's really, this is what we are talking about here. And this really kills the easy part of like just looking at the combos. I have three combos of set of eights, three combos of set of sevens. No, we don't have it. We all have it in certain frequencies. So just that as a little starter here. And yeah, let's see what's next. This is the spot. I hope this is clear. And today, this is the structure of today's lesson. We'll start as always with the brainstorm. I need your input to give you the best output. And this will be the first Kahoot question as always. Then we'll start with a little warmup quiz because actually the cutoff versus MP spot is quite easy. You can transfer that to every spot where the person in position has a linear three bet. Whether it's middle position versus early position or cutoff versus MP, all just means he's playing three bet only. He doesn't need to flat. Rake is so high. So many players left to act. So this is the simplification I suggest to everyone to simplify his game and then master that very spot. Then we talk a little about the spot itself, about different hand types and their goals by giving Pio examples and just brainstorming a little. So no paint games today. Unfortunately, I could have made some, but it's the same over and over again a little, but we'll put that in words today. And then there's the big test with the master quiz, big blind versus small blind. It's the same things applying, just the spot is way wilder. It's really wider ranges against each other and it's not a linear range anymore. It's like villain has bullshit like ace four off and 10, eight off and king six, whatever, and 10, three suited. So it's like a little better mix where it's not like super black or white. This board is good for him. This board is good for us and so on. So this is why I call it the master quiz. Lots of mixes, lots of weird lines. And just this little test, right? There's no way. And I would have made lots of mistakes in that quiz. This is just a little way to test you a little, and then we go back to the key takeaways and wrap it up. So let's start as always the Kahoot. I hope every one of you is in now. Let me just check. We have 30 people in here, 21 in the Kahoot. So maybe one, two, three more seconds. And I mean, you can still join. You just, I think you have everything you need in the chat anyways. If someone is late, I can start here anyways and you make it happen. So question is always just give me any input. What is running through your head when getting into today's spot? What do you think about? Which sizings do you use? Whatever, what do you perceive villain to do on the flop? Checking back and just really anything. Throw it at me so I have a little overview. If it's your first session, this is what i do every community coaching because i think it's just way better that i can talk a little to your needs where i see okay everything makes sense or something is messed up or whatever and then we talk about it so i'll be back let you talk enough time oh let's say hi to the to the people in the community chat getting some more people in here maybe like for that 98 seconds or two minutes you have time there i should start having a nice little music on the next times all right so sorting the ideas let's go plenty of input that makes me happy so let's have a look at that villain's flop size compared to the expected one on that board type all right so first thing is we won't talk about flop c bets today because we talk about the turn after check check check, check. So obviously his flop size is interesting, but unfortunately we don't get in that spot. So maybe I transfer that, that it makes sense to like, well, is he maybe checking back a board that he shouldn't check back often? It's kind of like using a different sizing as well. Or is he just like, I don't know. That's it pretty much. If the villain checks on the board, he has no nut advantage over time. Oh, the Taka missed this. That's fine. If the villain checks on the board, he has no nut advantage over time oh the man taka missed this that's fine if villain checks on the board he has no nut advantage over time still strong little checks i mean not necessarily the biggest nut advantage right just not having that advantage doesn't lead to a hundred percent c-bet necessarily all right just like he probably is not like super super super incredibly ahead the villain still has strong hands when he checks back flop being the aggressor. Usually having some strong value. Practice many players will have a very weak check back range. That's absolutely true. People like betting when they have something. Long type board distribution sizings pre. All right, pre-sizing. What is actually his pre-range? Already here, not in the cutoff versus MP example too much, but something to take into account for big blind versus small blind. I could play all day long here against the solver, big blind versus small blind, and whatever is on there would be totally ridiculously bad in the real life. But the solver is 3-betting 19% there, having all those freaking offsuit bluffs. But the players I play mainly play like 3-bet 10% to 14% in that spot. So clearly missing lots of bluffs, which changes a lot of dynamics. So Willem's preflop range, he has pie or two tight. Exactly what you write here. Not much how kept this Willem. 33% bets on favorable turn cards. In a way, yes, when it makes sense. We'll have a look at that. Willem's 3-bet, should he often see bet or not? Right? Absolutely. Is it more action game? Because we are the favorite. So maybe I can tell you already all the sins we look at today. I didn't allow donking the flop. Obviously, there are some spots where we could donk. Actually, those where we are like performing the best. But since this has happened so rarely, I think it's more realistic to just look at the check only to get easier guidelines. Out of position would have some block when flop, go, check, check. Absolutely. The question is when. On which type of boards? Why? What is the reason? What do we achieve with that? You've got to be prepared for the hand types and goals slide here. So if you check on high frequency c-bet board, then he might cap or trapping. Reads are on. If he checks back on a 90% plus% plus C betting board, some people always have the pocket Queens on King high. Some others always have like only a trap, like a check back on Jack, Jack 10. Like I can smell his quads and bolts already. I'm going to check back GTO or only special hands exactly that. This is the perfect moment for notes. What does this checking range consist of, right? This is actually, we are in the reaction game here. So equity, not advantage. We can choose size against the strong or weak part. What are we attacking? Always a great question. Are we attacking something? If we can answer that question, any sizing can be good. We will never make something that is horrible, right? If we use that reasoning to make sense of our bet. What mistakes villain makes, right? Looking into the future. So now we looked in the past, what did villain do wrong or potentially wrong when checking back? Now looking into the future, what does he do wrong next? He checks back weak. Does he always call once and then folds? Does he call down too much because he always has showdown value? Is he overfolding the turn? Where is the problem? Deciding when deciding to lead the turn and how to react if called, right? Having a plan already, which loves are you going all the way with? What about blockers maybe? And so on. Is villain helping to build the pot or do we have to do it ourselves? This is a copy paste out of one of the slides today. Definitely. Necessity to deny equity. Another quote out of the slides today. I can tell you already. I don't want pot. Is villain helping? Very, very good two inputs here. In general, cap after check back flop. That's the question. Yes. We should check the turnover population tendencies, right? Is there something we can just say we want to bet more than in general for this and that reason? We want to bet less or more for value or bluff heavy. How does the turn card fit the ranges? All right. Pretty nice. All good stuff. stuff actually if we put that together in the right way we have the full session today so that's it i'm super happy and yeah let's test those things so what i did was actually running that pyro trainer and i just copy pasted the spots as they came up when i got into that spot so i played cutoff versus middle position three bad pot i pot. I was always the player out of position. And then I played a hand and probably villain c-bets, which means, okay, I fold and I won't copy it into that session here. So what that means is you actually get from the couple of boards that I ran, you get a realistic scenario, how often things come up. It's like, okay, most of the time he c-bets, but when he checks on that board, it's like he will more often check back a board that actually he checks. It's not like me deciding something. It's really the randomness or like the frequencies that could appear in real time. So let's go from here. And now this is the easy warmup quiz. It's just five hands. Don't get confused by the Pio trainer because you only see two players, but it's not heads up. It is empty versus cutoff. You are in middle position. You call the three bet from the cutoff. You will see that in the questions. There is a picture in there and it was check, check on the flop. And now you are only asked for the highest frequency option that the solver wants to take. Sometimes there are more options, which will be in the master quiz, but here it's only about the highest frequency one. So maybe I'm pretty sure lots of you will get five correct. So middle position versus cutoff, three bad pot after check, check which option is preferred on that board. Only 20 seconds, speed round it is. Boom. All right. Most of you didn't get it. That's fine. So maybe I should explain the sizes. There was a really short time for the first one. We have the two E-sizing, shout out to Ciparino here. The 206 going directional in for exactly a hundred big lines. This year is 75%. The 124, the bet 50 is the block bet. That's, was it 30%, I guess? Yeah, that was 30%. And obviously the check is a check. So here, 10, 8, 3 got check, check. And then there was another low card where villain is sitting on all the high cards in this world. Ace, king, ace, queen, king, queen, ace, jack. And we definitely want to deny equity, have value at the same time. So everyone who clicked on check, that's totally valid as well. It's just the bet is the higher frequency. Check is sometimes fine. It should be like 70, 30, 80, 20, whatever. Depends on how long you run the sim. Both are fine, but that smallest is definitely the highest frequency. So only three people now with a chance to get all five right. I think this might have been already the toughest one. Let's see, next same spot 20 seconds should be enough so steve damon surai suraj i'm not sure let's go anyways monitor on board check back another four on the turn we got the freaking ace queen of nothing all right we got all the checks in the world some small bats trying to fold out ace king or getting called by ace jack. I'm not sure. That looks good. Still three in contention here. Let's go. Pocket sixes on a double flush draw ace high board. Weak enough to start bluffing maybe. All right. I got seven of you or nine of you with a crazy bluff. Way too easy for a villain to react on that ace sideboard. Checking back lots of ace-axe. Having the double flush draw up here, which makes it always easy to continue. This is just a give up for now. All right. Speed matters, guys. Speed matters. Two more to go. Now gutshot. Ace high board checked back again. King on the turn. Villains kings improve to a freaking set. Freaking nuts. We have the gutshot. Lookalike to ace queen and ace 10 suited. Boom. Henry freaking checked again. So this is actually, yeah, the bet 124 is fine guys. This is the other option. If it's not the 206 even, but check is actually highest frequency. Blocking Queens and tens is really, really bad. And yeah, just the King is such a great card for Billons since Kings is his highest frequency hand. Yep. Pavel, here we go. Last one. Still close. At the first one, 0.1 late. Yeah, you gotta speed up there. Let's go. Straight out there. Check check on Jack-10-9. Wow. What's up with you guys? Everyone crazy? I mean, this is actually a 100% check, not even close to do anything. Like a block bet is obviously the smallest mistake, but this is so easy for in position to react. And first of all, what the heck is he checking back on jack 10, nine? That's like strength only. Yeah, let's actually have a quick look at that before we see who won the first part of the quiz, because I have all the sims here. Let me just see. Sometimes needs a little loaded here. Where's the, that was cutoff versus MP here. And we have the jack 10, nine and the turn was, do we still see the picture? No. It was some kind of seven check, right? We see only 20% check from in position pocket eights. High frequency makes a lot of sense. Actually the bottom set here, make it big for you guys. Check, check. And then we have, was it a flush draw? Does someone remember? Just put it in the chat. Seven of diamonds, seven of spades, something like that. Who's confident? Yeah. Diamonds. Let's go. Okay. All right. So here we go. Some big betting, some checking, ace, jack. We didn't have diamonds. We definitely didn't have diamonds. So we go with a hundred percent check. And if we look at the EV, we lose five, like everyone who wanted to bet big loses five dollars here you can just send them on on gg that's fine so let's go and yeah that was a little starting quiz let's have a look who took it down nothing changed no one correct no points so no one here checking of the of the first five interesting so let's keep that for now it's pretty close the master The master quiz will be way, way, way tougher, and we will have 10 questions. So everything is possible. If you have zero points or you join the show now, you can still easily win. All right. So let's go to hand types and goals. Actually like the main part of why are we doing what and so on of today's session. And I always start with highest EV hands. Actually, make sure to check that out. There was a great question yesterday or two days ago in the cash discord, where someone asked like, if I want to run the solvers and do all kinds of things, which spots should I go for first? And I gave an answer there that you should go for the money-making spots, how I call them. Those that have highest EV, usually in position, nut advantage, range advantage, and so on, right? Like open raising button, big blind flats, three betting in position, and so on. So this is the same here, how I want to proceed. Highest EV definitely have nuts. Second highest EV definitely like will be medium strong value hands. And then in the end, we talk about the bluffs and they are only more additions they are just by definition in a way more like zero ev in the theory world so this is how we want to tackle things very easy for nuts is that we have a clear goal our goal is to get freaking all in and now the only thing we need to think about and we have that in the in the brainstorm part already is it my job or villain's job to go directional in just in total if we look at ranges right if like let's say flop is five five three and turn is an ace should i blast it with my five to get the money against this ace in in or is he betting himself and i can just check race and go from there and protect the rest of my range so this is what the first thought is about nuts right and then a little about okay how much do i need to fast play maybe we could add here do i need to get the money now or is it fine to wait for later right if the board is changing a lot i better get the nuts in now right if there's i might have a cooler on my side but lots of action killer cards on the river where there's a four card flush and a straight and i don't get it in the middle anymore with my top set well then maybe we we are focused a little on fast playing more but this is the main thing is villain helping to build a pot or not this tells us should we overbet or not is villain having nuts we probably never overbet is villain not having anything but just bluff catchers well we probably go pretty crazy right this is everything we need to know for the first part. And this is what we will do post-flop as well in the quiz and what actually how it works. Right. So we look at that and there we go. We know we have nuts. We made a decision. Second part, medium strong value. So the goal of this hand type is obviously to get a certain amount of value, not directional in. Some hands try to get one big street, maybe a block bet plus one big street, maybe two big streets, but not overbet directional in. And the second thing is we want to deny equity when there is any. So if let's say, I don't want to take examples from the quiz, but let's say we have something that is nutted right now, but just any overcard kills our hand. Maybe we want to make sure we get more money in now so this year's to think about now getting the money in or later right if there's no equity to be denied we can protect our range and like check once more make sure we have the best hand and then over bet the river for exactly the amount of value we want to get and well is there equity to be denied be denied? Then we definitely have to play a little more aggressively. All right, third type, draws. And here I put down, remember, in my definition of anything in poker, like every freaking hand is a draw. It's just about what are you drawing to? Sometimes you're drawing to the nuts. This is what typically is called a draw. Sometimes you're drawing to something that still has one value bet. That's a good draw. Sometimes you are drawing to something that you can't even value bet anymore, but it wins against something. Sometimes you are just drawing to, well, something that has some hope if it goes check down all the way to win sometimes. And sometimes you are just actually hopeless and lost, right? So, I mean, something like a pocket, we will have lots of pockets here in this spot out of position we'll always have like some kind of two outs something like a four or five suited might be freaking dead on ace king queen something so then then actually i mean we are drawing to fourth or fifth pair but we can call that air at some point so everything that does not beat the weakest weakest hand that villain is checking back all the way does not have any showdown value. So maybe that was a long sentence, but really this is important. What I want to think about always is what are all my hands that actually do not have showdown value? Lots of people make the big mistake of only thinking about the turn, about the state of play where they are right now, instead of thinking ahead on the right it's like yeah but i still be this and that right if i have king high and villain has queen high that's great but will and will never check down queen high in a spot like this so we don't have any showdown value so every hand that we figure out doesn't have any showdown value in a spot like this goes into my pool of potential bluffs, right? We are now in the last thing. We had our nuts, we have our medium strong value hands, and now it's about all the other hands that we want to add in the perfect fashion. And this is really the first thing when we think about, hey, what are our bluffs? To know, okay, what are actually my candidates? What is my full pool? It might be the pocket that you feel like it has show run value, but actually it doesn't. So something like that might be a cool bluff because compared to something else that is really nothing, it still has two outs to the freaking nut or to a set. I mean, not the freaking nuts, but that counts, I guess. So those draws, they have the goal to realize equity, to make sure they see more cards when they wish to, and they have the goal to choose against the favorable range to play against. Remember, by choosing a certain line, we are making the choice which range we play against. If we bet big, we only play against this continuing range. If we do well against this continuing range, we want to do that maybe. If we only do well against this folding range, well, then that is definitely the last thing that we want to be doing. Right. So this would be the tip typical, like just fold out any worse and get called by any better. I were like, once there are still equities around that we can deny, then it makes sense. But on a super dry board where there's no equity to be denied, that would be the worst thing we can do. So here it's really, what should we think about? It's really about choosing the range we play against. What is the one calling folding? If I'm betting amount X, what happens if I overbet? What if I bet 75%? What if I block bet? Good stuff happening for me, bad stuff happening for me. And we'll come back to our principles as always. A little lookalike principle here, Which value hands does it go hand in hand with? Where does it make sense? Maybe I start having a value range where I hate to see certain cards. Maybe then it's a good idea to cover those bad cards with my bluffs. That actually my bluffs improve on those cards. And I still have a good range on the river. So these are all the things. And once we have those categories already, well, then everything is easy in a way, right? So we know which type of hand we are having and high EV hands are the important ones to play correctly. The draws are all additions, right? We are talking here about a slightly good bluff, a slightly bad bluff or whatever, right? It's like, yeah, just checking down the set hurts, but checking down here is not really killing it. So yeah, this is what you need to make sure we are doing a good job with. First, most important. Second, still important. Third, while trying to get the best out of it. But if you mess this one up, it doesn't matter too much. Okay. Now let's get to the first two big examples. Boom. Example number one. I hope this is clear. That type of board here, we have an ace, five, five rainbow board and a six on the turn. Just try to follow what I'm saying instead of just reading it. I know there's way too much on the slide right now, but I want to guide you through it. You see already the pattern of like what Pio suggests here, which sizing. The only thing we are doing is either checking or going directional in. And you can already guess by just looking at that freaking chart here, what's like the line, right? The line is the freaking trips more or less or ace king, but this is already a mix. So the nuts here, they want to go directional in and we can see already, well, there's no help expected. Phil either has like a weak ace, medium ace or a pair in between that's it like why should he raise here if we block that or whatever like he's not really helping our five to get money in the middle so we need to do the job ourselves here right let's go directional in we tell him we have a five let's go or we have a bluff next thing is medium strong value so i looked it up already if the river is a brick then villain is bluffing everything that is worse than pocket eights and he even starts bluffing pocket sevens at some point so everything that is not pocket eights or better literally has no showdown value right it's like very obvious thing that we've checked down our pocket threes or something but actually they have no showdown value against the solver here maybe against very bad players that check down their king jack or something so this is just what is the thing that means they all go everything worse goes into our pool of potential bluffs and everything eights plus and not nutted is fine to check again because there is no equity that we need to deny villain is not improving to any new nutter tense like maybe he has two outs, but even if he has something like queen jack and I have pocket eights, I obviously cannot really deny equity. And if he hits his queen, he does so, but he still cannot value bet. So it's not really not an effect because the board is somewhat locked up given that ace here. So right, this is why there's no small betting existing. And well, it's just the check and go from there. And then we look at the third type, which is now everything sevens and minus. And we just look at, well, everything without showdown value. We're talking about the river play here already. And when we check out what is our equity against calling range and what are the best blockers. So here, I think blockers are not the main reason because villains shouldn't have sixes too often right if there was a nine i guess it's very very important to use the nine as a blocker because we want to make sure villain cannot have pocket nines so this is what we see very very often we start betting our value four five five six pocket fives pocket sixes and then the best ace five even right some of you might think it's a great trap, but you're not really. Like what is happening good? Like nothing. So this is the thing. And then it's the question, what are the next best bluffs? Well, maybe the six is a slightly fine blocker, but I think it's even more about the two outs to hit the nuts on a six river. This is just pretty nice. Two outs to hit a boat with fours and threes without having showdown value, pretty nice. And then obviously something like the seven, eight, nine, eight, just open ender flush draw. That's pretty good. And then the king high flush draws, they are somewhat in between. They obviously can bet, but actually there's good stuff happening and bad stuff happening at the same time. So this is pretty much how it works there for a very, very easy black or white example. It's really, we go directional in or we check. And yeah, maybe this is something to keep in mind already because this is a board where people and well, for me now, you are the people. So maybe, yeah, I'm just talking about you right now. And the first thing you would do if someone checks back against you here, that you start betting 75 with your ace queen that's what people are doing just like all the time but 75 75 it's like it's the same in a way to like you can check once more see one more street and then you can bet whatever amount you want right something like that or you check race against villains ace four that you should value bet in the end something like that so it's just doesn't fit into your range this is a huge chance for actually i like checking back a lot on the flop against bad players because they tell me their hand on the turn right they are not bluffing threes and fours they are not bluffing six seven well they are bluffing seven eight that's fine and they bet their strong hands large for value but they have a different sizing with ace queen ace jack and I can just navigate through the pot way better because, well, I know what I'm playing against. Well, there are lots of like those type of face-up players. All right. Yeah, let's take a second and I'll give you the chance to ask any question in the chat if there is any, or just let me know if this is pretty clear and everyone knew. So before going to the second example, which will obviously be, if I talk about black and white examples, it's a very different one. Don't be shy. Feel free to ask anything. So solver is pretty much never trapping the nuts only when it makes sense. Here, what is he trapping against? What could the villain start doing? To bluff catch, we don't need the nuts. That's just the thing, right? If villain cannot start bluffing a lot, then we just call him down with ace 10. Yeah, to then to trap and then... Yeah, if we had aces in our range, we would trap that. Just because we are blocking everything to death. And we hope we have an upside of Villain having pocket 10s hitting a 10. Let's read that. What makes sense here? If Villain starts exploding here on that turn card, well, then we want to have some traps. But this turn is absolutely ours. That's like just... This is just, yeah, this is just totally us with the 7-8 connectivity, with the six blockers. We have more sixes than he does and so on. So we'll have other spots where the solver is definitely trapping. And actually the next example will be one of those. Let's just get to that. Maybe a short look at this sim as well. Why solver choose some pocket threes and fours to go all in well he needs some more bluffs to have a correct ratio so it so first the fours and threes they are just the best candidates they are just they are blocking ace four ace three that villain might have especially the ace four i guess and they have two outs and they have no showdown value that's better than anything you see here so this is why this is the next edition is bluffs not the perfect ones right It's like not awesome bluffs because it's not going for it 100%, but yeah, that's it. And the ace king, it's just, yeah, it's fine to go in that direction, but it's not like a super, super nutted hand. Actually on ace-5-5, villain should probably check back some ace-king himself. So it's like not super, super nutted. So let's just have a quick look at how the solvers place that spot. This, where is it? This one here. So let's just have a quick look at how the solvers place that spot this where is it this one here all right so let's just have a quick look we obviously check 100 yeah uh why no i answered that first why no need to deny equity isn't there not enough two high parts or in three bad part we cannot deny too much we have a trade-off because we are investing into every better hand and villain sits there with ace x with kings with queens and so on and compared to that as you figured out yourself already he just doesn't have many high cards he has like some king queen offsuit that's it right we are just investing too much into villains nuts because in that like non-nut area we actually still have a disadvantage let's have let's have a look at villains check back range what are we actually playing against villain should check back aces ace queen already a lot right because it's villain's position here just means well going three street or not he doesn't need to deny a lot of equity either when he has ace queen maximum two outs against him so it's a question is this a three street value hand or not we can just double check what is calling down if i just get a brick board i just click my way through way through here, directional in, and then river, another brick. Best case for Ace-Queen, we see that Ace-Queen is not even a clear river value bet, right? Depends on the suits and so on. So it's like, yeah, Ace-Queen doesn't want to necessarily go for three streets. So why not checking in the first place? And then, well, Ace-King is just, is obviously good enough, but it's like not a weaker play to check back and then raise at some point, or just to call it down. If someone bets ace-king here all the time and ace-queen all the time, what we can start doing after check-check, this would be now exploitative if people check back face up hands, right? If you know he has ace-eight all the time, well, what happens is on that six of spades, I take ace-ten plus directional in so here this is not the case villain is still protected so we need to choose rather wisely so here we see pocket force likes to take the spades as well and yeah i'm actually i'm not sure why the spades are great because the four of spades shouldn't be really it's just it's blocking the ace four of spades that's it okay so yeah why even ace king is checking half i hope that explains it because it's not a weaker play and yeah why solver choose threes and fours that's it let's just see how to continue here now we either check and see what villain does and we are still caught in reaction game or we take over initiative go crazy villain has call only he has aces as has his ace king, ace queen, but they are already bluff catching. Ace queen is, yeah, winning $9 in a $370 pot. This is not feeling great. And once he calls and we get, let's say, a brick river, we can jam ace king plus. And the best bluffs, as we see, are actually those having a six. Every hand with the six has no showdown value, but it has a nice blocker, just for the few times that villains still might have pocket sixes. So this makes a lot of sense, and it's better than a random seven, eight, which is obviously a bluff also. But yeah, so this is it. And fours and threes, not really going all the way. Okay, not only pocket six. I think a six suited is not in villain's range. Let's just see. A six suited is not in here. But if it's in there, definitely. Absolutely. Just that blocker is massive, right? We are talking about very tight ranges. And therefore, it's really, it's a thing, right? I show you again, let's say the eight. Let's look at an eight. Willem checks back pocket eights rather often. So check, check. Let's see an eight on the turn. Seven, eight and eight, nine are just the perfect hands. And those are, I guess, the hands that overbet and go all the way on the river. It's way better than a seven, six. It's like it's a pattern that we need to get right in our mind that this is no showdown value at all, at any point. It's like just very natural to start bluffing with seven, six and sometimes check and hope with that seven, 8, where in reality, this is just the way, way, way, way better bluff. But we see already what kind of dollar amounts we're talking about here. This is solved for $1,000 stacks. And our bluff in theory makes $26. That's really, this is why I showed again, the nuts most important to play correctly, strong value hands, second most important, and so showing here again ace queen ace jack ace 10 we check on the turn again say ghost check check and we have a break on the river but this is what i meant with we can do anything we want ace queen is just a 150 percent over bet now i'm just attacking villains ace eight and so on okay this was a very very clear example where there's not much or no equity denying going on at all on the turn so it's only boom nuts in your face or nothing and yeah let's let's see another one now boom example number two we have a fancy board of eight five deuce this is not great enough for in position that he can bet full range so he needs to check back some ace king, ace queen, king queen, whatever, ace 10, and then on the turn another brick. Just nothing happens on the turn. No one of both ranges has any deuce. And this is what we see here. You see the pattern now? Actually, out of position wants to bet 100%, but I guess again lots of players will use that 75% button. And we can see it from the chart already. I didn't run those forever. If I ran that sim a little longer, this would totally disappear because it doesn't make sense in any logic, right? It's either we want to tackle villains, check back pocket sevens, five, six, eight, seven, maybe, and go directional in. Or we want to attack villains, king, queen, ace, queen, ace, Jack, which we do with that small size. So now this is something where we have way more of the peers on the one hand, and we have way more of the strong things here, just talking about Jacks and Tens. Now, maybe this answers the question regarding Nuts before, because you see already, maybe the lookalike principle or what fits together plays the same way. So let's have a look here at nuts. First, it's important to figure out that jacks and tens are freaking nuts here, right? Yes, Willem can have the once in a lifetime check back with aces. That's okay, right? So vulnerable nuts want to go directional in, right? Or you could call it nuts right now, but not later, right? I like to stack off tens now, but not on a king river anymore, not on a queen, not on a jack, not on an ace river. Even on a seven, I'm not happy. So this is something why I want to fast play them now. And then I have the invulnerable nuts. Those are just the other way around. I would like villain to hit an ace or a king or to improve, I don't know, to weaker set or, I mean, actually these are boats, right? Let him improve to a straight. I don't care, right? So actually what we see here, Villain is helping here in that spot, right? Just if he hits the river with any high card, right? Because we don't have much ourselves. We always have weak peers and Villain will attack those on pretty much any card. It's not locked up like on that ace-axe export. So here they can slow play. Let, like give villain a little rope and it makes sense because in our range there's so much small shit that just goes for very thin value and equity denial. So nuts, different kinds of nuts have different incentives right away. And then next hand, medium strong value. 100% turnaround from last example. Equity denial here is incredibly important. Villain has with any hand has six outs. If we have pocket fours, if we have pocket threes, if we have pocket sevens, pocket sixes, five X, eight X, villain has freaking six outs every single time. And we want to deny that equity. If villain check back King Jack, giving him this free card hurts. So the block bet is the way to go here. Lots of small betting. We are protected by our sets. And then, well, what's left? Freaking broadways. I think everyone checks ace queen here all the time, which is not necessarily true. So we have a pool of potential bluffs. We have such a wide betting range. We can fit all of them in there. And we can just add them following the lookalike, right? Or like the same hand type. I have like pocket fives play like five, six, and ace eights play like eight nine so we cover ourselves and first hand that wants to bluff big with our jacks and tens is obviously jack ten suited queen jack suited queen ten suited making sure that villain folds his ace like dominating hands right away like ace jack ace ten king jack and so on so this is just how we can work out this spot again feel free to drop any questions in the chat. I like that a lot for the last board. And yeah, let's see, where is this one? Eight, five twos. I hope, yes, I have it here as well. So first of all, villain should only use a bigger size. I only offered quarter and half pot. If I offer a bigger size, villain would go for that bigger size, even on the flop, but the board is not good enough that it can bet full range. So we can first figure out what his checking range should be. The once in a lifetime aces maybe, but then mainly it's ace king, ace queen, ace jack, king queen. He has just too many unpaired hands. And then maybe something again, that is just not strong enough to go three streets. Pocket tens, it's very unnatural to check that back. So we can already see, usually it's weaker what people are checking back. Pocket sevens, six, five, pocket sixes, this type of stuff. So right, check, check. And then we had that deuce. Was it an offset deuce? This is exactly the simulation where we had the screenshot from. And let's just see what happens if we bet that with our jacks and tens. Villain sits there with ace king and hates his life. Villain sits there with pocket nines and actually hates his life. Sevens and sixes hates his life, and so on. I don't know. We can see what happens on the queen river that we hated before. All decks are still an easy value gem, just because we chose on the turn which range we want to play against. Villain never has a queen, like some few ace queen calls, but still sits on tens and nines and sevens in theory. So yeah, this is pretty sweet to see here. While if we bet small, we can double check what happens. Well, villain is incentivized to actually raise now with something like tens against our six, against our fours, our threes. So this is what I meant with villain is helping us. So what helps you here is really the dice principle always that, well, if you want to get in a set, what is stacking off against you? Well, nines and tens maybe, and jacks, and maybe a river top here. And then you can ask yourself, are those hands value betting or raising themselves? If you have any questions, feel don't need to go crazy. If the answer is no, well, then you need to take over the job. Okay, let's see. Is there any reason why jack, nine, ten, nine want to go smaller when they are lookalikes of jacks and tens? We don't have them too often on the turn. I just expect them to bet large and more often than queen jack, for example, as they get better hands to fold. Oh, well, they are just weaker outs, right? It's just, you cannot jam on a nine, I guess, right? So 10, nine in this simulation, if I overbet now, I run into lots of tens. That's just the difference. With queen jack and jack 10, I still have way better equity against that. And if I hit my pier on the river, I can easily jam. On the nine, if I hit a nine, let's say I play that line with nine-ten, I hit my nine, it's not a value jam. Because wall-six-seven got there as well, and so on. It's just weaker equity. All right. So it's really that, what do you want to play against, right? First thought could be jack-ten. I want to get rid of freaking king-jack and ace-jack and ace- to make sure in case i hit it's perfect why we cannot this is the only thing we can influence we can obviously you could just hope to hit as well but you know exactly how often you will hit so it's better to prepare for the spots and play them perfect and again seeing those sims here should help you the most with figuring out what your opponents are doing wrong. It's like pocket tens. Not many people realize that they should go directional. They click again on that 75% button. You get lots of free cards because people are scared to block bet their force. Well, just sit there, see that free card and be happy about it. This is EV right away. Okay. Sorry. Last one. So what we figured out now is I gave you two extreme examples and maybe, okay, with two options now, maybe we can either look at one more mixed example or we do the quiz first. So the quiz will be blind versus blind with lots of options, right? This, I gave you one black and one white example. Everything we look at is gray in the middle. There will be incentives for this, for this, and that. That makes it tough. Mix Excel. Okay. So let's say example first is the number one in the chat. Quiz first is the number two. Just give me a feedback here. Example first is the number one. One, one, one. Okay. Mix example. Let's just get one of those out. Let's get go to one blind versus blind spots. Jack seven, reasonable for a mix so now i show you the range slowly first right so here out of position calling range blind versus blind all kinds of offsuit broadways as well very different not so tight all the pockets all the suited good stuff so yeah i mean pretty standard and then this year a real solver three betting range. All the offsuit ace bullshit, all the offsuit king bullshit, all the middle-ish bullshit, and then the very bad suited stuff, and obviously the kind of linear value range. So now that jack, seven, six board, pretty good board to see that big on, to get like have the advantage right now. Willem didn't hit too much or like out of position didn't hit too much. So make use of your advantage of queens, kings, aces. Just bet a little bigger. But obviously a lot of checkbacks as well. We have 7x, we have something like 10-8, 10-9, jack-9. Just try to get a feel for that range. If it's really like that, right? King-7, king-6, all those are checkbacks. So now let's have a look at three different types of turns. Check, check. First, let's start with the brick. So here we see already board is rather dynamic. There are some pocket jacks that want to check back pretty often, actually. This is what protects us, or not us, but in position. And that's about it. But if the, so that means if the turn is a brick, where is it here? Offsuit deuce. We see lots of overbetting. Lots, lots, lots, lots, lots of overbetting. This is just, well, everything that is a jack or better can overbet and we can add all the bluffs right here king queen is like the most natural bluff of all times i guess having six outs tries to fold out ace queen ace king eight nine obviously as well everything with the draw four five and so on super super standard nuts want to go directional in everything jack and better is nuts here on that board. And wall denying equity, not really a thing. It's out of position. We have so much shit ourselves. It's not like we have more 7x or 6x. We have all that ace high, all that king high. It doesn't make much sense to start betting king 10 small or so now. Okay, this is one example for hard brick, which means very good for us. Let's go the other way around. Offsuit ace. Very, very, very, very different. So, well, ace is obviously in positions card. We have an advantage regarding king-jack. They can't do anything. But again, there's nothing going on with equity denial. So yeah, we can either check full range or just take some of the super nuts and super nuts only, adding super draws and it that's that's pretty much it so yeah we'll check and then rather check raise a little right villain should even go directional in with his ace king ace queen right here some check raising but rather reaction game again okay now let's see a turn card where both players have everything all of a sudden right we have seen the 10-8 off back checks the jack checks, and so on. Let's get us a 9 and add a flush draw. This is what we see right away. Villain has nuts. So that means for everyone who watched all the lessons, villain has nuts, overbet not allowed. Easy, right? Villain is helping us. So we just go with a normal bet instead of overbet. Small bet still makes it super easy for villain. We try to attack certain hand types, right? The nutted stuff, we can check bet normal it's just building a pot it's like that kind of mix betting small can be fine sometimes as well with certain hands right something like 9x maybe wants to deny equity a little pocket nines the same way we see already that sim would need to run a little longer to have a more clear answer but well first thing is it's not always over bet if villain has the nuts as well but if you have someone who is not three betting correctly this is the first board i want to over bet on they don't have jack nine and ten eight no way so i just go directional in and hope for them to call down their pocket tents so this would be one example i make one more let's see these are the 10 boards we will have in the quiz by the way so if you if you look sharply now you can gain an edge here maybe one where there's some block betting going on blind versus blind is not too much block betting so try the king five four but it should be pretty similar to the jack seven six even more locked up actually so but more more of the low cards here might lead to more block betting just or you see like villain is checking back something like queen nine like jack nine offsuit those are hands that we can block bet against if there is a another small card and so here just right i'm trying to to come up with a board where it makes sense where you can attack something and here it's just okay something like pocket eights doesn't want to get give a free card but it's not really a value bet either so something like that can make sense all right eight nine just buying a card a weak king is not really ready to go for two streets that's now i think about the three categories again one two three one is nuts two is medium strong value and this just try to navigate into one direction right it's like it's not two big streets it's more like this year if willem calls let's get a brick there's no brick but the four maybe and then we have one clear bet of value that's a kind of how we want like i i call it one and a half streets that i want to get on the chart so maybe that and yeah i hope that helped a little often there are lots of options so maybe think about actually i just remember that i messed up the quiz i guess because you only have 20 seconds which is way too tough for here i didn't change that that's just a pre pre in there so yeah try to be rather quick and i mean there will be so many mixes so this time there's two or three answers correct pretty often right something like this where it's like yeah king eight suited block bet is fine check is fine and maybe maybe even the normal bet is fine right like queen eight you find reasons for everything right it's like, yeah, king-eight suited, block bet is fine, check is fine, and maybe even the normal bet is fine, right? Like queen-eight, you find reasons for everything, right? It's more, maybe take the quiz more like, make sure to not click on the wrong thing, right? Bluffing ace-jack here is horrible. So blocking or checking juices is fine, but betting huge doesn't make any sense, right? So just try to go into the right pattern. it's unfortunate that the point system in the quiz only rewards absolute correct answers i don't expect many of those because well i didn't do it myself but it's more like that so don't be frustrated it's more a little challenge and yeah let's see all right here's standings pavel let's see whether you can defend the the pole position here so multiple answers correct all right this important. With ace-jack after check-check on that ace-queen-seven and a brick on the turn. So actually three things are correct. The small bet doesn't make any sense here. It doesn't make any sense. We want to challenge villain's like bluff catching hands, like his weak ace, his queen X and so on. So it's the question is ace jack nutted enough to go linear sizing directional in? It's close. Or is it just going smaller, right? Villain is slightly protected. He definitely has some two pairs on that turn and so on. So we don't need to go directional. It's close. And obviously, well, if I talk about Ace-Jack wants to challenge something like the weak Ace, at some point that will bet itself. So it's actually, we could check as well. So it's like, yeah, lots of back and forth. So I can tell you that the check option, maybe this is a good hint, the check option will almost always be correct. I'm not sure whether there's a single one where it's not correct just because it makes sense with those wide ranges. That check is a great option to get money in the middle as well. Okay, so it's more the big overbet or block bet questions here. Let's see. Nice. Second hand crushing it. Let's go. Oh, it seems like you even get points for just two out of three correct. So we got the king eight bullshit on five five three six all right so here actually i wanted to block bet that in game when i was playing which doesn't make any sense it's actually just the check because well i was playing the cutoff versus mp before where we just like all our ranges peers and broadways and suited broadways and here it's like yeah we have some peers but on six six five three where's our advantage it's like we have all the king queen off suits and king jack off suits and so on so there's there's no reason for us to go crazy and king eight like such a bad bluffing hand that has nothing going for it is the worst one so this is just check hope to see one more free card and if not it's a perfect check fold points flying in here points flying in let's go ace queen seven again another almost brick on the turn we have pocket eights right turning into two bluff maybe trying to deny some equity from like a jack x 10x 10-x. Just checking, trying to see a showdown. Pretty obvious one, I guess. Denying equity on A-side boards, never a great idea. Betting big is very, very ambitious. If you have seen pocket nines in your neighbor's hand, maybe then. Low board again, queen-10 of diamonds this time. 5-5-3-4. We had 5-5-3-6 before with the with the king eight here you got the queen 10 suited all right i was hoping there actually when playing it i clicked on check and i was hoping for maybe some overbetting maybe some overbetting allowed it it feels so much like folding out king 10 and king queen and queen jack makes so much sense but actually again that low board is just not it's just not us blind versus blind so good choice just to check all the time that's so overbet seems reasonable would be absolutely if we were again different positions here that king high is just still doing okay we are drawing to hit a king or a jack which gives us lots of showdown value still so it's not that we have like necessarily showdown value but by betting huge we kill those six outs in a way because we get called by ace, ax, and so on. It's not a wrong thought necessarily that overbet, but this thought is just too much here. 10, 9, 4, pairing the 4. Looks so tempting that we block the 4x suited, but they are not in those ranges. All right. Wow. Everything here, actually, if we want to bet, we go huge making sure we fold out a queen ace King getting called by King Jack and queen Jack at the same time. So this is, this is a little plus there and yeah, just going directional in where obviously just the check and go from there is always a fine option there. Just something in between the block bet is I think the worst option here, but yeah. New leader, Siggy, let's freaking go. Finally, we have something. No more bluffing, guys. Nine, six, deuceos seven with the flush remember villain has all the jack nines and the ten eights and so on it's not like we are crushing this board all right maybe too much of a hint we can check it again which is always correct on a board like this and the block bet is actually the highest frequency choice here i guess yeah nice just, nice. Just folding out something king, queen, no spades is worth a lot for us. Oh, nice comeback. This is close. Is it two more, I guess? Three more. Pocket fives. Queen on the turn. King-jack looks nutted. Queen-ten looks nutted. Queen-nine looks nutted. Ace-jack. Pocket fours, pocket nines, all in our range. All right. This was fancy. Actually it's a block bet is fine. I looked it up. I was surprised myself. I clicked on the check and thought that's it. Overbet is too much. We have like two outers not good enough. We have way better bluffs on that board. But the block bet is actually fine because at the same time we fold out sixes, sevens and we get called by four X, which will check down most rivers. So it's kind of a very, very special move here with the pocket fives. And I think even only with the fives with hearts that we had. So that was a little, little tricky play here. And we got someone awesome. Here we go. Two more. Oh, this is, this is kind of exciting. Peer plus idiot open ender. Let's call it that way. All right, here. Pretty nice to see that. Here, lock bet looks a little tempting just for my feeling as well. But with all the 7x, 8x that Willem can have, we are not folding out 10x or 9x. It's just like we are investing money into a range that is crushing us. So this is just a check go from the Realize Aqua team. And now someone is on fire. Let's go. Chevy, Chewy, let's go. Last one. Good luck everyone. Freaking nice hand to have. But that king on the turn. Chebby Chewy for the title. So we have a nice nine, right? This is not a blocker we want to use. Nine has infinite showdown value here, obviously. It's actually good enough for a small value bet. So that just overbetting is not a thing. Betting big just isolates us against king-axe in a way. We don't like that. So the small bet to fold out some random ace highs to get some money in against anything because we're doing well. We're obviously the check with such a hand is the perfect play. And now let's see who is our winner today. Seven out of 15. That's pretty strong. I didn't expect that many. Pundit it. Here we go. Okay. Sigi, Chevy, congrats to you guys. Second hand down to fifth. Okay. I'll keep that for here to post it later on for the community chat. You got to deliver under pressure. That's poker. Okay. I hope you enjoyed that. And actually it's that you have seen it here a little. It's really just as easy as it was. It was not a big presentation today, right? It was just, I showed you, right? We have nuts. We have medium, strong, or we have draws. And this is the order I think about those. And they have different kinds of goals with those little black or white examples. And maybe some ways to think that we talked about to really get the perfect ones out, but it's not rocket science. So let's, this is already talking about the key takeaways. Pretty much. It's like, what is important? Take your time in those spots, put your hand in the right category and think about the goals of this certain hand. And then really just mentioning that again, like it's, it's really not no rocket science. It's that easy. And then the second thing is that i want to let's hear the last point that i wrote down actually i always want to know what is the weakest hand with actual showdown value because this tells me already what is my whole bunch of like pool of potential bluffs that i can choose from the best let's for example we have seen the pocket fives on that queen 10 9 4 board something like that where villain will check down 4x. So our pocket fives on that queen 10-9-4 board something like that where villain will check down 4x so our pocket fives clearly had showdown value this told me right away there's no way we are ever betting big with this like we won't use that as a bluff it's just too good but it was not in my pool of potential bluffs and then well i would have gone for the check and that the fancy block bet is a thing because it's getting called by worse and folds out better. Well, that is just something that I miss every day, but this is definitely okay. But this is something where we could find our way to not make a mistake and bluff to light here or there. This is the first thing. And then the second thing is really, I always want to know what is the weakest hand that I'm happily going for stacks with especially in those where an overbet is a thing i like really the jack seven six for it and the deuce on the turn this one let's pull it out once more we're just like this tells us already how much we can bluff and just to get a feeling it's check check turn is a freaking deuce of clubs and we can go for stacks with every jack we are having i just knowing the weakest hand i know okay he doesn't check back like a strong jack so i can take my freaking jack eight here and go for stacks which tells you jack eight jack nine jack ten queen jack king jack ace jack all of that which tells you right away it's infinite bluffs really infinite bluffs that we can use and this is what you see here represented king queen something like bullshit like queen ten is just one over card and blocking pocket 10s one over card that's it and we smash it so realizing that and putting the money in the middle in the right spots and maybe chilling in the wrong spots or in the right spots to chill is is the key there and it's really those easy guidelines should bring you there so actually like when i was when i was, that's a show that it lets you lose use the last five minutes to actually show hopefully it works out how kind of easy it is. We're just to play that here. Where is that actually tools? Oh, trainer, right? This is just the two I played for making this quiz. Let's play easy one. Cutoff versus MP play this pack here and only play out of position. Say we go directional in with Jack-9 on Jack-7, 6-2s. What do we expect Milind to pay us with? Well, I don't care. If you say he is not calling, then you bluff your full range, right? Then you bluff your full range if you're not expecting that he's calling. He should call. We can have a look in this one. Where is it? Here. We overbet. He calls. 10s, six river hopefully another brick we jam or any jack is good and he calls some ace heights he blocks ace jack king jack some seven x but we carry those weak jack x that he's checking down but mainly he's falling a lot which allows us to bluff a lot right it's just mainly we are saying you just don't have better and this is why we are going crazy and so i think it's even more true when we see like here in theory villains should check back quite some king jack and so on definitely not happening yes exactly chris here i asked yesterday's question of which spots to sim first these don't seem like money making spots given the criteria and your answer however they seem like spots that most players will not play well at all. Absolutely. The money-making spot here that I told you was the in-position player. Because out-of-position is way tougher. Obviously, it's good to know that, but this spot that we talked about today is not coming up so often. This is why it's not the first to study and wasn't in the video so far. So the in-position part where we see that high frequency is way more important to get correct first. So So this is when we get thrown into that. So if you want to sim a lot, you need to know first that this is a good board to see that big on. This is important. You get into that spot way more often. Okay. Now it's like we go direction on with Jack nine to protect our, yeah. I mean, it's like, we don't, it's just understanding villain doesn't have better whether he calls down or not. We don't care if he calls down with something weaker and he only has weaker our value hands make money if he never calls down our bluffs make money but by using bigger sizes we allow ourselves to bluff more right villains price is getting worse so we can bluff more and this is why we try to cheat and now i'm just super fancy to play some freaking hands here right so this year is now another this is cutoff versus mp again and i just want to show you how easy it is with those with those rules in the end all right so i cannot show you everything there because the screen is too small i have it on the second screen where it shows me what is correct or not i will just tell you we're obviously checking out of position and on that 10 it's already closed whether we want to bet pretty much everything like on the 10 8 or 10 4 deuce deuce or what it was 8 4 deuce deuce i think here this is just a mandatory check again i see that right away yes awesome it's a check but block betting wouldn't be incorrect right here okay we fold now i have to play the flop as well unfortunately in that spot but if you stick want to stick around for another five minutes, I'm just playing here a little. And here it's like, okay, this is close. This is a spot that's more important. Again, Chris, here, this is what you should focus on, what to do in position here. I think fives without a spade, I can fold right away. It's rather close. And here it's like, yeah, it says, oh, wait, I see a couple of things here. I see the most frequent action and I see the EV mistake. So here it's a mix between call and fold. Actually, it's more of a call, but EV mistake is zero. So actually you can see that as, okay, play perfectly. Okay, same board again. Check, check, 10, 6, 4, 10. Now this is our spot. Let's give those numbers. Let's try to rock that together. Check is the number one, small bet number two, big bet number three, over bet number four. Just type in the chat your opinion. Lots of twos, lots of twos. One can be a thing as well. More of two, okay. So we all agree on the block bet. Why? We want to fold out freaking king jack of diamonds. The one can be right as well, maybe because king jack of diamonds doesn't hurt us too much. Well if he has that and hits the jack or king of spades that's not that it's he has only four outs not six that's a big difference. Maybe it's more important to get money from something like eights and sevens right now right so that we don't get on the river king anymore. So I'm fine with the two and actually I see here right I just show you. Turn play, bet small is done 47% by the solver. Check is done 52%. But this is just where we see, okay. If I would have loved if half of the chat was check now and half of the chat was bet now because actually both is absolutely right. So, and then on the river, again, numbers one, two, three, four. One for the check, two for the first bet, three for the second bet, and so on. Two, three, two, one. Oh, more of a mix here. Two, three, two, one. Wow, guys. Anyone having our argument to support his opinion? So far, we are really unclear. I need someone to convince the others. The two is like just the buttons. I put numbers on the buttons. The check is the one. Bet 80 is the block. Bet is the two. The 199, the three is the bet 75. We are on the river. To keep something in on the river, the hand is over, Miguel. Or you mean like you want to let him bluff. Block to get value from like ace, king, ace, king, bet nine. Target eights and sevens. Okay. It's like check and block both. Find bigger bet isolates us against. So I think I definitely like the small bet over the check. Just because villain has, as I the high cards probably not too many bluffs cutoff versus mp spot here's some king queen off that's about it so it's more ace king ace queen and they are rather calling than bluffing and then it's the for checking if we want to check call something i think it makes more sense to take our 6x or our 7s or 8s because they have way they have less value and all the questions only are we strong enough for a bigger value bet or the small ones all we can get i personally think it's the small one but let's see oh fuck we get raised all right one fold two call three all in we're playing the solver all right yeah it's i mean it will be indifferent right it's like it too kind of can't be wrong calling with a space. So let's look him up. Okay, actually the, what the fuck? Okay. Okay, we are bad. River is 100% check and I have no clue why. And the river call then is just ridiculously bad. Interesting. All right, this is something we could, oh, well, we could work on that spotlight. Right now, following up after that, but this is really coming back to, to Chris question in the chat. It's really, Hey, this is really deep down the game tree, right? So I, one thing I wrote down was there really make sure to work on something that you are guaranteed to experience in the next session. This spot won't come up in the next session. Right? So let's, let's do one more for the good feel you call tens well let's call fold call fold who's in freaking fold okay let's fold too many people calling okay here we go mp versus cutoff let's play that ace king correctly we have seen a board like that today i mean if ace five five eight seven three whatever check check guys we have ace now. What's our freaking plan on a double flush draw board? Check, two, four, directional in, four, check raise, four. Okay, I give you a hint. It's not number four. Willem has lots of jacks. Willem has ace, jack, and the double flush draw makes it super easy for him to continue. So betting huge here, directional in, is really, really bad. I'll leave you one, two, three as options. One two three as options one three one three one three one three one three all right let's let's take the three i think the three looks like the most i don't know myself so here is what we see check 40 correct bet small 56 and the big bet is somewhat okay but it's like it's a stretch and why we will see in a second i'm not on this card because on pretty much any river card we hate our lives so now how much value are you going for now all right i think villain shouldn't check back too many sevens so this is really a nice card i'm in for the 310 as well and that was perfectly fine and actually a 70 percent play check call would be the other one okay so let's let's wrap it up there. But you see, I mean, it's really, it's not rocket science, but we get deeper down in the game trees, right? So the more coachings we have, the more further down the game tree we go, it's more interesting and more fun, but more mistakes as well compared to just always playing flops. So here it's important that you go back, like that you, that, that you change your routine from like, oh, I want to get everything right. Right. I don't play that with the goal of clicking every time on the correct things. It's about understanding, right. Learning from it, right. Taking something away from what I just told you, right. That double flush draw, Jack, how does it improve? And so on. What happens on the river? And so on. So this is something how we want to learn there because this is something that we can transfer over to all kinds of tough spots that come up in different areas of the game. So yeah, really maybe check out again the Discord thread that Chris opened because I think it's very, very good to think about that invest your time as as wisely as possible for everyone who has not infinite time and yeah thanks for attending today and let's put that slide out there again you can set positions instead of having it heads up oh nice i peck this one yeah that makes sense i just started doing that for the first time today nevermore so thanks for that input all right maybe for at least three of you to leave with a good feeling have a good time guys and and yeah see you in discord
