### TOPIC: cash postflop 3bet river blockbet
 All right. So by now you should see the little presentation I started here or prepared. As always, give it two, three, four minutes to have everyone join. And as always, as I mentioned in the thread already, we got the Kahoot here. So yeah, good to see you here. Early Birds, Thomas, Jerome, Damien, Tucker. So all my guys from the Cash Game channels here. Let's see how many tournament guys we got today here joining us. So actually, it's not too many questions today, but the ones I'm having are on the tougher side, some of them at least. So I would really like one of my cash game guys to win this one today. For everyone interested, I'm rocking the VFL Osnabrück shirt today because we got a friend of PokerCode, Maurice Trapp, who is actually a central defender for Osnabrück, to celebrate their latest victory and his personal goal. Yeah, I rocked this shirt today. And I have no clue how Vienna is today actually, because yeah, I don't know. You see all the bags or how you say that, like the stuff back there. Yeah, moving is tomorrow. I will fly to Vienna tomorrow. All the stuff stuff will arrive on friday yeah it was a very stressful couple of days and in hindsight i shouldn't have scheduled this coaching for today because now the office is actually the only room where i still need to just like undo all the stuff and yeah my desk my screens here and everything so i will do that once we're finished here yeah so no box is still in the old place all right only 12 people so far i need a little more i need a little more so make sure to join the the kahoot here you go philip jeremy good to see you guys 20 so far in the in the coaching so 13 in the kahoot i think it makes a lot of sense to join today so make sure to find your way here it's as easy as it looks like just join www.kahoot.it and put in the game pin all right still have got some open stuff here okay close some stuff now google translate all right so not learning russian but i had a there was a russian comment under the latest youtube video so i tried to understand but whatever google translate made out of it in German didn't make any sense. And usually it's like kind of easy to translate Google translate into a real language, but that was just like, didn't make any sense. So yeah, but now I clicked it away already. Just if someone, you can, you can just check out the latest video, I think it should be the latest one on the Poker Code channel on YouTube. If anybody is good in Russian, make sure to translate that for me. Just write it down there in the comments. I could see how that comment could go in either directions of just like being a random inflation comment or some whatever. I don't know. Yeah, just the... let's let's investigate together youtube poker code here you go it's this one here and should be the latest comment this one do it together i didn't try into english so far so what millions were for maximum 10 years ago it was a 1500 victory is like my translation here let's see what the english tells us yeah i don't know i don't know so if someone i don't know if someone it's like i feel like back in school when it was about interpreting like random stuff like poems or something i could see this going into very different directions whatever so anyways we have great stuff coming up in the YouTube channel. I just read through the next videos that will come up. I obviously know mine, but there's great stuff coming from Matthias and Fedor as well. Make sure to check that out from time to time, support that channel. And yeah, we're putting lots of effort in there. And now I think good time to start 25 in the coaching now, 18 in the Kahoot. I think this is due to the early time. Usually we are a couple more, but you see like I need some hours to get the boxes packed later on. So it's a little earlier for most of you, I guess. Yeah. Last chance to jump into the Kahoot. Well, not actually, but I will just start with a presentation and yeah, let's finally get to our topic that you guys chose. It was a very, very, very clear voting this time. I was so much prepared to talk about the flush topic because I love it a lot, talking about the flush zone and what's happening there. Maybe we keep that for another time or just some other videos that I do. And yeah, today it's all about the river block bet. And as always, I just want to make sure that we are all on the same page, right? We have almost or some professional players in here as well as some fun players that are very motivated to learn more. So I just want to make sure everyone knows what we are talking about. And the whole spot is just about us being out of position on the river. So we are talking about a river spot today. And what happened before that is very important is that either we did bet on the river so we are talking about a river spot today and what happened before that is very important is that either either we did bet on the turn so we maybe we see that the flop maybe we see that the turn and then it's again on us on the river out of position or it went check check on the turn so that could be something in our example today it will be the button or or some race first in guy guy, seabedding, we call in the big blind, turn goes check, check, and then on the river, we again open the action. So I'm not talking about donks today, right? If we call a second barrel and then think about donking the river, that would be another thing. And we could name it a block bet as well. But I just want to make sure this is not what I'm talking about today. Today, it's about we either kept barreling all the time and then it's our decision to think about a block bet or it went check, check on the turn. We were mainly not the aggressor or it's like bet, check, bet option, something like that. And block bet for those that are not kind of new to the terms is just meaning like a very, very small bet. So I'm saying here 10% to 30%. I think anything below 10% can make sense in a way as well, but it's not the typical block bet. So if you tell me, yeah, I do this, I do that. And then I did block bet the river. I kind of guess something like 25%. That's my standard hotkey there. But even going as low as 10% can make a lot of sense. So what's up? We lost some in the Kahoot. Guys, 16. We need, I think we have 18. Or am I just getting old? I don't know. So don't forget about that. Nice. Welcome back, Francois, Edmund. So let's go. Yeah. A little overview about today. All right. So the river block bet today. As always in my coachings, I first want to know something from you. So first question as always will be, you tell me what you think about river block betting. Then what I did actually was splitting up the block betting into two different spots that I see very, very differently. And then we will talk them through separately to just make sure the classical divide and conquer, really break it down to one spot and then trying to understand that as good as possible. So that's the goal, obviously, to still make use of all your input. I didn't name, I just call it main spot number one, main spot number two, to not help you too much there. And then we'll summarize all that with key takeaways we will have a look at some pyro sims we will draw some stuff and paint and obviously have some questions as well so cimorino is ready i actually aware it's not here yet uh what's his name damn it i forgot the name pavel pavel should be here in five minutes he even asked me to postpone 15 minutes, but I try to be not like the Deutsche Bahn and be a little on time today, but he will be in time for the important stuff in the Kahoot. Now, yeah, I'll start. And yeah, I need your input. As always, just a brainstorm question. When do you use river blockbats? You can tell me anything about river blockbats. You see a little nice picture of where I used one. Actually, that was a check down pot and a bomb pot, if you ever played that. But yeah, just tell me when do you use river blockbets? Which hands do you use it with? Which opponents do you use it against? What's kind of the special thing about it? Everything that comes to mind. And then I hopefully can take, as always, some of the terms and we will see them throughout the coachings that you get a better overall picture of the whole thing. Great to see Severino not rocking the 2E today, because today it's not about the big sizes. The S in Severino stands for small today. So we'll go for the small bets. Maybe sometimes with a plan in the back of our mind to go crazy against something, but no 2E. So yeah those that participate in one of the first coachings just feel free to put there's no wrong answers for now later we collect points but then we only see the top three so just make sure to click on something all the time and then you learn even more all right so let's have a look block to race today. Maybe. Alright. When villain is very low in his range and our range too strong. Okay. So, I mean, he's very low in his range. I understand that you know his hand. I think you just mean like he has kind of a weak range and we are just super, super strong. Alright, so we have to give him a good reason to call in a way with a good price we're we're giving him only use good hands versus opponents that can raise enough otherwise go thin okay already thinking on the exploitative level so everything left is a little exploitative here exploitatively that small bet puts villain in a tough spot right not even talking about value or bluff or whatever yes those small bets can put villains certain range parts in tough spots suspect villain has missed draws i think you are a little thinking in the bluffing direction right to just bluff like very cheap bluff doing something like that to get villain in a tough position to choose if value bluff hand okay when we block villains calling range and you see that just from the small stuff i reach here i can it's just like small stuff but i know way more about what you were thinking about. Here we are thinking about value hands. Here we were thinking about bluffs mainly. Yeah, all of that will play a role, obviously. Preventing villain from using bigger sizes and he can only call mostly. That's kind of the classical scenario of a block bet. This is where the block comes from. We want to block villain from doing we don't want to face a big bet with our hand but it's good for a small bet so we just put it out because game theoretical and even more psychological it's just a very very different thing to raise that amount than just call so it's like yeah this is this is definitely it he could do it with a very nutted hand so that villain wants to raise his i would love to see here with the option of re-raising then all in or something so this is definitely correct and we want to do that if we are deep enough so when we're playing like 30 big blinds or something in a tournament and we can easily go all in ourselves that's not when we use block bets maybe in some special blocking situations use hands that block his calling range of a big bet yes build a range well i mean if we are bluffing we want to use exactly those bluffs for the big bet but this seems to be value as well build a range around weak value force villain to call hands he would check back first time we hear about the check back we mainly use that block bet as well to not allow villain to check back. So block bet is only out of position. That's the main, main, main difference. When I want to bluff cheaply and have a lot of fold equity, well, that's good. Like gaining a lot of fold equity with small bets, if that's the case, perfect. We don't have many bluffs, but a lot of medium showdown value hands, absolutely. Small block bet can get villain to bluff. Inducing, we heard that word a lot. This is just describing the whole thing. Get to showdown cheaply. Block just instead of facing a big bet. Middle pair is thin value. Minimum one pair. Low showdown equity. Marginal showdown hands, right? Just like getting cheaply to showdown. That's kind of all the same. Get thin prevent from face you see like the same pattern over and over again so we actually see yeah kind of all the things we have seen bluffs we have seen value bets we have seen value bets with the plan of then re-raising with a very strong hand we have seen thin value to make sure to not face a big bet kind of the typical scenario and yeah wet board aggro players okay we're having blockers to auto folds but can't resist to check and give up i call that the so-called last hope bluff just throw something out there that at least for villain there is a fold button popping up right if i check to him he doesn't have a chance of folding so it's like kind of the i call that the last hope bluff that sounds that. Block betting to induce again, thin value and for hands that want to get raised. All right. So lots of things. All right. So no points for that one. And I'm not a hundred percent sure when the next question will come up. I'll try to remember. It's always the same, but let's just continue here a little. Hey, Pavel, good to have you here. You only missed the brainstorm, as I promised. Right now, I want to describe the river block bet myself. So what happens? And yes, that is Asnabrück. Shout out to Maurice Trapp, central defender and friend of PokerCode. The river block bet is, for me, we are choosing a bet size to force villain to continue a certain part of his range. By choosing a small bet size, we force villain to play the majority of his range, right? So I gave a couple of examples, right? A normal bet that I, how I usually call it, like a 75% bet. Villain needs to continue 57% of his range, which just means he can almost throw half of his range away, more or less, right? If I pot bet, it's exactly half of his range. And that makes it kind of easy when villain is protected, is having lots of strong hands and so on. If I bet very, very small and villain doesn't want me to bluff cheaply, he needs to continue a lot of his range. If not, my bluffs are printing. This is why I made the needs like that. So yeah, against 25%, villain needs to continue 80% of his range. If he doesn't do it like that, we are printing with our bluffs. But at the same time, this is our chance to print with thin value. Because, well, if villain wants to continue 80% of his range, there will be lots of shithands in certain scenarios. So in the end, I want to see every single bet size talking about out of position as just the situation that we choose the range we want to play against. And out of position, this is so important for me that we kill villain's checking option. If we check to villain, he can just take the free showdown and build a betting range himself. And this is the main difference to in position. We are pretty much never using very small sizes imposition because the benefit of that is countered by the downside that we allow villain to act again, right? We are killing our checking option ourselves to just, let's say, we bet 10% imposition. How much value should that generate compared to, oh, villain can read something into our bet. We are kind of face up and then he can go crazy. So they are just very, very exceptional spots where we really want to do that. And out of position as written down here, there is just no game theoretical downside. For me, actually out of position, I like to call a check out of position, just a bet of zero. And it's in our heads. It's a very, very big difference between checking and betting. But actually, that's kind of a fluent thing. I could, like, whether we are checking or we are betting, min betting, it's kind of the same thing. And there it's like, we're betting 5% pot, 10% pot, 20%. It's more like just a little more every time. For me, it's like, you could see it as we are actually forced to bet every single time when we are out of position. We have the option of betting zero as well. But this takes a little, the logic away that there is a big difference, whether we bet 0% or 5 or or 20% or then pot is obviously a difference. But from the game theoretical logic, it's just a pure dollar amount we are investing more or less. It's not like we are opening up a different part of the game tree compared to in position. So this is very, very, very important to really understand. And it's just really maybe go into your next session with that mindset. You have to bet every single time when you're out of position. Your bet can be zero. That's okay. But especially in thin river situations, if we would offer that to solvers, there would be even more very, very small bet sizes. They are super tough to balance them. But well, in our world, usually that doesn't matter too much. It's just like, okay, how strong is my hand and what do I want to go for? And how many bluffs can I add to make it kind of a balanced strategy? That's the same thing over and over again. So now to start the quiz a little, I made, actually not yet. I'm not sure. What's the next question? I think the next question is just about the block bet in general. Oh, let me see. Let me see the next question. Yeah, that's definitely the one. Just a question for you. You answered it in the brainstorm already. Yeah. Which hand categories is the block bet made for? And the question is not mainly, it's just like every hand category that somehow fits in there. All right. So, I mean, I don't know whether it was obvious or not. This was kind of a trick question because everything makes sense, right? You even mentioned all of that. We have read about cheap bluffs. We have read about cheap bluffs we have read about thin value we have read about super nuts and obviously all of that depends on the spot itself so this is kind of correct as well and i mean i guess not many of you clicked on all the four but just i want to really visual have you visualize that again but it's not like block bet is for thin value block bet is my last hope left snow. It makes sense in certain situations when there's like something happened before and ranges are just in that way. And then we try to find the perfect mix. And we will talk about that in this coaching today. So really that. Now in the last slide, I gave you two examples and we start very, very easy. I hope most of you get that right, where I did the math for you kind of, of how much villain needs to defend. Needs again like that, just in theory, if he doesn't want to overfold. So I just made two quick ones. You only have 20 seconds. Just choose the correct one for two more of the bet sizings, right? So just another option for the block bet. bet if we bet 10 how much of his range is villain forced to defend if someone wants to be super smart feel free to just put the whole equation you need to have the whole math behind it in the chat so seems like we need to work a little on that is someone someone ready to put it in there? Just what is the math again for just like do the calculation there? All right. Yeah, Steve is partly correct. You're just looking for the fold equity needed. So it's the one minus kind of that is missing. But yeah, it's like we have to take the 10% of the pot or like that. Now I'm definitely messing it up if I do it like that, right? We take the bet size, divide it through pot size, which is one if we just talk in percent and do that here. And this is the fold equity needed. And obviously like one minus that is the part that Ville needs to defend. I just do it that way. So think away that minus here, and then we've got the 91%. Yeah. One more for the quick ones. 20 seconds for the next one 300 percent pot all right so still working on that so what we do here is again we take our bet size and divide it through our bet size plus the pot size right so it's like here would be 100% for the pot size plus the 300. This is the fold equity we need to make our bet successful. This is what Willem does not want to give us. So it's kind of this here. Again, think away the minus. It's just easier with a calculator like that. So the 25%, right? So what I want to show with that is just what we are actually doing with our bet size is we choose pretty much the range we want to play against. Always with a backup. Oh, if villain just decides to do something else, our bluffs are printing money. That is kind of how the whole out of position game works, especially on the river then. Okay. so the next questions will be more poker like more poker hand related and probably on the river then. Okay, so the next questions will be more poker hand related and probably on the tougher side. Let's see. So now we are getting to our, I call it the main spot number one. And for me, I make a big difference whether we play wide or tight ranges and what happened before. So now here, my main spot number one is the one where we did polarize before, because that changes everything how our range looks like. Polarizing means at some point we decided, all right, we are betting big for value, or we have a bluff. That's it. We won't have anything in between. On the turn, let's say we're overbetting the turn, we won't do that with a random mid pair, most likely. It's either a clear bluff or a clear value hand. And yeah, so here just reading that out, what's up here? Polarizing on the turn means trying to get direction all in in this spot. So here my example is the three bet pot from the small blind versus button. In my cash game world, where we play 100 big blinds deep, there's lots of small betting on the flop. And then on the turn is the decision point where we, yeah, think about go big or go home, kind of. And the thing is that usually our range just, yeah, includes clear value hands. And with clear value hands, I mean those that plan ahead. They plan ahead to stack off on brick rivers. Let's say we have a queen high board, turn is a whatever brick. We have pocket kings. Boom. Let's stack his queen X and anything else. If the river is a brick, we know already on the turn, we will stack off. And we will have bluffs. Best part is if our bluffs still have a chance to be a value hand at some point right so if it's again the queen high board we could have a king or an ace in our range or have like whatever the board is a gut shot or a straight draw or something like that that is obviously a helper as well so this is kind of how our range looks like and that already tells us since this our turn plan, that a block bet only makes sense on board-changing cards. So if the river is a brick, we had our plan. We go all in and hope to stack villain with our value hands. And yeah, hope to make him fold with our bluffs or speaking about our full range, make him indifferent and we don't care in a way how he answers. He just needs to answer kind of correctly so keep that in mind we did polarize on the turn and this is how the ranges look like now and i think i need to have a little preview all right so yeah now is the time for the first and i guess kind of tough question so now i will give you a hand history maybe i i talk you through it before that you can use the full time to think. It's small blind versus button, a three bet pot. And the board is queen, jack, five with a flush draw. You will see the board in a second. I just want to prepare you. The board is queen, jack, five with a flush draw. I do range bet. I didn't give you any other option. We bet our full range or almost our full range with a small sizing. Villain decides to call. Turn is a super brick. Queen, jack, five, still flush draw, and the turn is an offsuit deuce. And now is the clear point where we go, mainly use our linear sizing. Shout out to 2E Barino. We use our linear sizing to go directional. But obviously, you know, there might be lots of things happening on the river. Queen, Jack, 5 with the flush draw, offsuit deuce, and yeah, offsuit deuce, and then different river cards. And now what I want from you is that I'll offer you four different river cards. and I want you to sort them from highest frequency to lowest of how often we use the block bet, right? So if you so far listen carefully, you probably should at least know one, right, where it is, but let's see. Scoreboard, all right. So three bet pots, small blind versus button, hundred big blinds. We have The queen of clubs queen of clubs jack of hearts five of clubs turn is a deuce of space we did bet 30 on the flop and bet 75 on the turn and now sort the block bet frequency high to low from those optional river cards an offsuit ace an offsuit three an offsuit king or the nine that brings the flush to give you a little help this year is your turn betting range or pio's turn betting range that you have an idea how your range looks like and it feels like it's it's really fast paced here that half of the time of the minute is already over to just explain the hand but yeah give, give it your best. Make sure to hit the highest and the lowest. Highest frequency and lowest. That's most important always, because then I know your idea was kind of on the right way. All right. So no one got all of them, but okay. After that coaching, we'll try to be better, right? This is a very, very tough one. For me, most important right now is that you understand that the three of spades is the one where we do not have block bets at all, or for very very specific reasons so i think there we have like six seven percent block bet if you really want to the king of diamonds is actually the card where we use the most block betting for certain reasons the nine of clubs is actually the worst card for us in the deck or from from that choices here just because villain makes straights and flushes but that forces us to really check a lot instead of having lots of block bets. It's really the king and the ace, but the king is the winner with the block bets. And yeah, now we want to investigate the extreme examples of that, right? So now I think we start with the easy one, the three of spades. And now I will guide you through all of that. That looks a little like rocket science now. And if you too much into pile trust me it's not a big problem right i'll try to explain it in easy ways so now we have that spot queen jack five deuce the river is the super brick maybe we have ace four suited and that's what gets there but that's about it and now the picture on the bottom right shows the equity of both players on that runoff, off the pants that we get there with. So what we see here, the green dots are the hands we are having. So what we see here is the very, very top we are kind of even. Maybe green has a slight advantage. And then there's a certain point where green player has a huge advantage, like that gap. like we have very very strong hands villain has like whatever we have very very strong hands villain has whatever these are the gaps we're actually looking for and then at some point this year actually in position is the stronger player just like he has more jack x oh thomas that's sad no i said queen and it was shown on the picture so it doesn't matter. Okay, what is important here is really to figure out where our advantage is and this year I love those range explorer graphs. I'll show you in Pio for those that use it where you see that but still that works just you don't need Pio for that just thinking about it. We have kings, aces we have queen jack which villain probably jams on the turn a lot or raises on the flop fives villain should fast play at some point as well given all the equity and draws against him so we have a very clear advantage here as the out of position player and that is represented by all those nutted hands here all right so i I think we could think about where our threshold is. I guess it's like king-queen-plus, but every hand that we did bet big on the turn that was a value hand still is a value hand and therefore goes for the jam. And we add bluffs. So we can go back to what we just talked about and think about, okay, choosing our bet size means we choose which range part we are playing against and here thinking about where our advantage is i would like to play against william's top 50 range part because this is exactly for my advantages and yeah this is how i make the maximum money so how do i get to play the top 50 range part well that would be a pot bet perfect right maybe we have pot left or i guess we have 75 80 percent left something like that that's as close as we can get so perfect if we bet small i mean that just makes it easy for a villain is not using our advantage to the maximum so this should be kind of clear things up and here you even see i copied that in here from pile we use only the all-in four percent of the block bet and i summarized that here clear advantage in the top 50 we should pressure to the maximum and only pocket queens is the hand that wants to actually block bet because well if we jam villain mainly calls queen x so he doesn't have that so by block betting we force villain to call more of his range and then he calls most of his jack x or all of that and this yeah just gives us extra value adding one whatever random bluff there all right feel free i know this is a lot if you have never seen that but feel free to ask questions in the chat right this is here for for you i try to make it somewhat interesting for a kind of new players that are just like learning basics but as well for those players that want to tackle high stakes so it's like it's kind of a stretch with all that but really for me it's important the understanding that oh what doesn't make sense we did polarize on the turn we have it or we don't river doesn't change anything let's freaking go very curious about the bluffs we are adding here because we probably don't need many at all yeah a four percent range that's queens only which is two combos we can add like 0.2 combinations of bluffs or whatever like i'm making up numbers so we shouldn't care about that it's just the maybe something that is just unblocking villains fold so if i get there with a six seven of whatever maybe i can try that sometimes all right don't worry if the graphs are intimidating i know that i feel the same but i will explain the same later again in my own words with just paint which makes things a little easier so yeah let's go to the next one just see now you should still have in mind that the king offsuit king was the the card where we use the most block betting so maybe you have already an idea how that fancy graph could look like and this is what we will see here so what happens on that king villain improves to king queen and king jack some ace 10 that he still should have definitely 10.9. So what we see here is that actually in the top 30 with all the two pairs out there both players are equally good and what happens here is just well all the advantage is here in the next best area kind of we have ace king while villain has jack x we have ace king he has jack 10 we have ace queen he still has a random pocket we have a river random king we have king nine a river king nine that villain doesn't have anymore something like that so all our aces are not nutted anymore we have aces he doesn't have that we have ace king he has that low frequency. So actually here is our advantage way more in that area. And that, if we see the graph, it's easy, but it's obviously tough to come up with a graph, shows us the yellow rectangle. This is what I put in there, right? It's just, this is what I want to tackle. I want to play my top 80% in a way against his top 80%. And yeah, because there is my clear advantage. And this is what I achieved with just block betting. And this is backed up by the strategy here. We are only checking 25% because all the time we are having something. It's very tough to have air here. We're block betting pretty much all the time. And you can think it the other way around as well, because this is the big mistake that people are often making to just block bet their thin value, right? You river your king 10 here. Maybe I get him to call ace queen or even jack 10 or whatever. But if he jams, damn it, then I have a, yeah, it's all face up and so on. But it makes sense for lots of your nutted hands as well. Let's say you have pocket kings. Obviously you block the whole calling range now with this king, right? Villain cannot have many king queens, not many king jacks, so actually you can increase your value by betting smaller with a small hand. And you see here that villain is very strong himself, so he has a good reason of getting aggressive himself. So raising, maybe worse hands. And then adding bluffs. It's totally in his right to add bluffs to his value hands when he has those. And this is what your nutted hands then gain as well. And so here's something, if you have 10-9, you clearly want to jam. You unblock everything and so on. So guilty of jamming top set all the time. So there, it's i want to get it in it's really the thinking about what do i get it in against what i learned there actually from four bad pots where this thinking helps you quite a lot it's just accept what goes in anyways you don't have to think about those it's just like it's kind of the stupid thing that we that we do in game I want him to fold. I want him to call instead of thinking about what. I sit there with Kings. It goes against 10-9 anyways. I don't care about this hand. It goes in against Ace-10. I don't care about this hand. It goes in anyways. Jacks and fives, set over set, I don't care at all. So I don't have to worry about those hands anymore. then my new goal is how do i get the maximum money from ace queen jack 10 queen 10 queen jack maybe as well and then it's like oh hearing those hands it's like yeah maybe they can bluff against the block but they can definitely not really fold they can whatever oh this is way more money i'm making here. And this is a way of thinking that helps a lot. So first, really, this year is just building your wardrobe, understanding where is your advantage. You have all the top heroes in the world, the Rivered Ones, Villain doesn't have that. He sits more on Jack-X, stuff like that. So maybe we want to force him to play the majority of his range, and then we go from there. All right. see what's next already this quiz spot number two okay any questions regarding that board i mean i have it in piyo as well if you have a specific question that you want to look up that is just like killing you and i get some more water okay i hope i just don't scare you away so what can we assume if we are button and small line gems in that spot should we overfold exploitatively yes i would say i think it's more likely so let's just yeah i think it makes sense let's just have a short look at the simulation so first i show you i only no slide for the nine of clubs i didn't want to go through all of them i can show you quickly so let's just go through that here we can almost range that that board very high frequency we see that Bill mainly answers by calling like those vulnerable, nutted hands he can raise sometimes. Okay. He calls. Deuce of spades is the point where we clearly see polarization. Go directional all in 120, right? Sivarino can let you know how I call that sizing here. And yeah, so this is where we decide where we decide things. It's kind of king, queen plus, and then queen 10 gets indifferent in a way. And what I said before, like some ace jack is interesting, probably has other reasons as well, but okay. So here we bet that. And most of those hands have the clear plan to jam on bricks. This is how I defined the whole polarization thing, right? And then we had the three of spades. Kings can jam, ace queen can jam, king queen can jam. Aces actually can sometimes trap, okay, when they unblock clubs, stuff like that, whatever. 10-9 jams as a bluff, king 10 jams, queen 10 is actually good enough to jam. All right, so now, again, the king of diamonds, I guess. We see all the block betting. So now villains should block bet ace king, natural one. Aces is pretty close, depends a little on whether you have clubs or not. Ace queen is still like close whether you can. King queen blocking everything makes sense to block bet. King nine block bet. Ace five fancy bluff block bet. And then we have like the the gems are mainly those that unblock everything 10 9 ace 10 and the bluffs that kind of fit to that and we already see like 10 8 of clubs seems to be the one the one block bet bluff all right and then right now the question was what should we do if villain jams but our answer would be that that we call any two pair and king 10 already is indifferent i mean i guess i should always fold here and queen 10 and jack 10 and so on because you all know yourself and how your villains plays play i think it's more likely that they jam their kings that they jam their king queen sometimes just because they kind of have it and don't know another option with just three quarters pot left. So it's more likely that they jam all that or even look at pocket queens. It's a pure check here. It's very easy to just jam that because you have a set, right? It's like, this is more likely than over bluffing. In that scenario, just not possible. Like, yes, you can jam your freaking ace ace eight of clubs and then you just rip it into all kinds of two pairs. It's just losing money, right? Maybe if we overfold, then it starts slightly winning money. But yeah, that's not the big problem. So I think it's very, very likely that people deviate in one clear direction here. All right, let's have a quick look at the nine of clubs. We see just some block betting here. And then this is always the thing with the flush boards that blockers are such a big deal. Aces with or without the ace of clubs is a huge difference. Kings with or without the king of clubs is a huge difference. So once we have the two pairs and Sats villain has all the flushes. So this kind of evens, not evens out, but it's like working against all the block betting. And just this is villain's card, right? So here out of position on that nine of clubs, we have 46% equity. While on the king of diamonds, we had 58. It's just a very, very, very bad card for us. So we should mainly, yeah. Looks like only ice queen is using block bet on the nine of clubs. Yes, absolutely. So it's just a very very very bad card for us so we should mainly yeah looks like only ice queen is using block bet on the nine of clubs yes absolutely so it's just not the perfect spot right when we have blockers we want to use them like leverage them to the maximum and so on okay so i gotta move forward to to see some more ants even though this is obviously i love that spot it's super interesting and so much to learn from to dive deeper into that but this is what you can do like in smaller groups discussing the discussion threads obviously we could we could talk 90 minutes about just that board i would say and how how things are constructed this year is just the main overview understanding again what is important for me understanding where our advantage is where can we give trouble to villain how do we make it tough for him? It's not by jamming. He's super protected here. But by jamming, we force him to only call his top 50% more or less. And 30% of that are already nutted. That's like two pair plus, like no brainers. And then he can obviously just kind of overfold those or just sometimes call with the river king. That's okay. So it's make life very very easy for blue okay very new board i guess to make sure everyone gets it right now because there's the same quiz coming up again i'll guide you through this board here so this time we are the big blind again we did three bet we three bet against under the gun So very, very tight ranges. Ranges do not get tighter than that. And the board is a full swish brick board. 6-2-2 rainbow. So Thomas, you maybe repeat the board in the chat to make sure you got it right this time. The 6-2-2 rainbow, this should be our range. Most likely people are not having like those frequencies too often, but okay, we try to play correctly. On this board, I use half pot or even a slightly bigger size, but for the sake of the sim, I used half pot. Mainly, yeah, anything. And then we get called this time and the turn is the eight of diamonds. Big blind versus under the gun. All right, so the eight of diamonds, not a brick. Villain does have some pocket eights, but that's about it. So regarding our adventures for aces and kings and queens, that's still the same kind of. The flush draw is possible now. This is something to keep in mind. And now we will see a river card. The jack of diamonds will be one of those. And again, you can already think ahead to give yourself some time which river cards you think there will be lots of block betting and which there is none block betting. So here on the turn, again, we went for the 2E sizing, the linear sizing directional in. All those hands like jacks plus, pretty much if they decide to bet, they will go for an all in on a brick river. This year is just to sometimes mix it up and check jam and check raise or do whatever on the turn right away. So this is just the reason for the checking. If we bet river is a brick, they will jam. This is just how polarization works. All right. So where's the Kahoot? Let's go with the next question here. And to make sure there should be the board again on there. No points. So now you can win the quiz here. This is the toughest question today. Half pot flop, polarized turn, sort the block bet frequency from high to low. Thank you. points so now you can win the quiz here this is the toughest question today half pot flop polarized turn sort the block bed frequency from high to low again you see our range the river is a five of diamonds flush jack of diamonds flush king of hearts or the deuce of clubs full break again try to get the highest and the lowest frequency right everything in in between doesn't matter too much, but that's the first sign of really understanding things. I tried that out with a high-stakes student of mine who was very, very, very, very good. He didn't get it done. And I think before looking at it, I would have made a mistake as well. So just your chances are low. That's okay. But maybe we go for the lucky hit it's all about the process what you think through here nice six people getting it absolutely correct so i'm kind of proud really this was a super super super tough one just a flush thing it's like yeah maybe let me know in the chat. What was your thought process? It's just like, oh, okay. The deuce of clubs. We got that one, right? That's I mean, yes. Okay. Ace would have some, but not as much as the king. So I went for the king for like having the high frequency, but an ace would have a high frequency as well. And yeah, it's, it's, it's a little trap with the flush because obviously on the flush, it's like, ah, not a great card for us. So maybe block betting makes a lot of sense. But again, we have then the thing that we have seen on the nine of clubs in the last hand. That having the ace of clubs or whatever it is here, diamonds, just changes everything. And since all our hands are based around kings and aces and ace king, those blocker issues are massive. So king of hearts is really the kind of game-changing card here. All right, so AOB, thanks for that. Good to know. I thought about giving it two minutes. I tried to look for the 90 seconds, but that option was not there in Kahoot. So I went like one minute or two minutes. Let's go for the quick option. Jack of diamonds brings new top pairs where five of diamonds doesn't. Actually, not really, because we are only continuing with like random diamond draws that contain a jack. So if it's the jack of diamonds, yeah, maybe we ourselves have a low-frequency king-jack random-random. But it's very, very low-frequency. It's more a villain improves to pocket jacks instead of... The five is more of a... Yes, the flush, but nothing else. The jack is like, oh, he improves to jack's boat that he has all combos off and this is why he's a little it's a little more reason to block bet here all right very very cool king changed everything for queen's jack's tense yes and all the king x of diamonds and all the king queen let's just quickly have a look on that simulation so now you have seen like ace king with the king of diamonds and the ace of diamonds is a very high frequency c-bet on the turn. So out of position has lots of ace kings actually. And now kind of the fun part is that in position has lots of ace kings as well. And yeah, it's just on that board, it's six outs to the nuts in a way. And this is the best you can get here. And obviously all the flush draws, but they do not actually exist when the river will be a jack of diamonds and now yeah let's have a look at the easiest one first deuce of clubs as we said right jacks plus will just jam some bluffs as additions that's it ace king gives up because it still has some showdown value king jack of diamonds gives mainly up and then it's like the queen jack that's like the the yeah the top pairs you were talking about on the jack of diamonds river yeah they they are the best jams here that's it so now let's have a look at the highest frequency card that was the king of hearts i guess it doesn't look like so much block betting but if we really take frequencies into account which hands we are having how often that's just queens is so massive again pocket kings jamming does not make too much sense. If we jam, villain sits there. Yeah, I have lots of Ace-King. I don't need to call much more than that. But in reality, when you have Kings, obviously the in-position player never has Ace-King. Not often, right? So we see that against the jam, the calling range is very easy. Kings, Ace-King, boats, and rivered king, x, when you hit the flush draw king. And this year, just zero EV catchers that, yes, against most players, probably not really a thing. So very, very easy to react. And this should show you, yeah, pocket kings may be a good idea to just always block bet. King 10, king 9, block bet. Pocket queens, block bet. Against the block bet, villain is forced to call that way more often. Nines, tens. And maybe we'll talk about exploitative thoughts in the very end here. You can think about that here already. Are people jamming this year against the river block bet? I would say no, but yeah, that's up to everybody. And now let's have a look at the Jack of Diamonds quickly as well. We see some block betting, 20%, but actually Ace-King just decides to jam when it has a diamond, not jam when it doesn't have a diamond. Ace is doing the same. Actually, even the Aces without diamonds are just strong enough to jam. Kings, yes, the Kings without a diamond are maybe the candidate to just block better. king jack is a block on the river on river king because villain has so many ace kings and king jack is just not strong enough or actually king jack king jack was a jam sometimes somehow because where was it you see i think king jack of diamonds was a jam because queens are calling but it's very close you can see the ev numbers in bottom right. It's just $3 better than anything else. The king-queen, which blocks the queens that are mainly calling down. In the theory world, they are more of the, yeah, block bet. But this is very, very thin. So here, it would make sense to understand. Villain has quite some ace-kings. So it's very, very close where the king-queen, king-jack, king jack and king 10 are good enough and it would be important for me here right they are splitting up in that way just because of that reaction that people are pretty much never calling jacks and calling queens and tens more often just like a little little blocker issue that leads to a three dollar difference but that doesn't matter for me right or in game not at all so it's like for me it's important that you when you have king 10 and king jack and king queen think about how do i get the most money out of nines tens jacks and queens that's that's like the kind of the dice principle really thinking about that and like yeah if he has ace king he has ace king that's okay all right this one i didn't get all the graphs out there to not put too much in there i just gave you the numbers here and really said here really think about the goals of certain hands really that king jack of diamonds what do we try to achieve oh nice we river to top here and just jam is not the solution it's like oh he has all the jacks all the tens all the queens how do i get the maximum out of that i'd be ready to get stacked when he did float his ace king all the way and now river to better top here that's okay if he has a boat that's okay focus on the hands that really matter so now great to have seen some of you getting all those four correct in the correct order and you know let me actually see what is the paint oh paint next actually i planned as always just way too much into the session now i want to show you how before pile i thinking about that spot. And I'll just give you, most of you or all of you that watched some of the videos know my little paint line graphs here, I hope. So they just represent a range and I'll start with a polarized range here. I have the nuts that try to go all in when the board doesn't change, or I have bluffs. I guess that easy one right so we were the three better we had brick boards or that queen high board whatever hero with polarized range now what happens is yeah villain's range villain's range is more like that maybe he has some nuts but he mainly has like medium strong stuff i did the last board that's like tens nines any random peer random pair. On that queen jack five board, it's like a random queen, a random jack, like stuff like that. And obviously he maybe has like some draws as well that are a little weaker. So this is how the range structure is. And that tells us already, okay, if nothing changes, the range structures stay the same, then this part tries to get value from this part by using a big size and add some of the bluffs. That's it. River all in. Easy game. But now the question is what changes with river cards? And this is where block betting comes into play. And now here are two options. Option number one. Villain makes new nuts. So let's take something out of Villain's medium strong hands or his draws, this could be a flush draw as well. And say he hits his flush. This is super nuts now. Our king's aces or whatever it was is still like having that strength. So now the question is, how do they still get value if they jam? What if they jam? Think about that here again. Jamming just means Villain needs to defend 50% of his range. So kind of this year. Damn it, that's all better than us, right? Maybe villain is calling one or two worse hands as well to call enough, but that's it. So what's the goal? Well, they try to challenge that part here if it's still strong enough, right? So we need to decrease the sizing and force villain to defend those here. If not, he's overfolding. So this is one reason for the block bets villain improved to enough not a chance we have seen that on the queen jack five deuce king for example on the nine of clubs villain had too many nuts so actually we we started checking quite a lot so this is one option yeah very very kind of obvious one villain improves damn it we cannot stack anymore. Let's try to squeeze out the little last money. And now the other option is our ear could actually improve to something good, but not nutted. So we could do something like that. This year improves. Queen, Jack, five deuce. And the river is a king. And we just river a freaking king. Ace, king. Not two pair, not straight, not nothing, but good enough enough to bet for value now so now we have a problem that villain have no reasons at all to call us because well we are our bluffs so we need to incentivize him to call that trashy hands but again we do that with a very small size small size means he only needs to find one bluff in a lifetime from us to make it kind of a profitable call. So we again force him to defend all that. And then those hands are all of a sudden good enough that we can call it a value bet. And now you could say, okay, but what if villain raises? Well, not a problem. Obviously it is a problem, but not one that we wouldn't have in the other spot. We've learned in the beginning that actually out of position we are always forced to bet. Sometimes we bet zero, sometimes we bet 10%, sometimes 25%, but we do not change the game tree. If we check those hands instead, the villain will check back this lower part and still jam, and then we have the same problem, just that we missed the value from the villain's part. And this is how it's important to understand those block bets. It's not like, oh, but we are face up now and villain's always jamming. Well, if he is always, we have to call him off. And if he has the nuts and is like just playing that, that's like the same thing happened. We only invested the exact amount of money that we did invest. And we do so for a good reason because our hand is strong enough given the villain's range. So now these were the two examples how ranges can change. All our air gets there or villain improves so much that our value hands that plan to stack off are not strong enough anymore. Obviously in the real world, this is almost always a mix of those two. I just think of that king, some nuts get there some ear is a top here now it's like a mix of that and this is that we need that's a puzzle we need to put together well that's what we get a feeling for and now this was actually one of the two spots that we talked about today so i might need to speed up in the next one a little yeah so this is after polarizing itizing. It's kind of easy because we know our range structure. All right, that was that slide. Paint and spot number two. Here we go. Let's take a sip of water. Everyone, maybe you take one minute off to refresh your brain. That was lots of talking, lots of visualizations, and then ready to keep going. So now we have wide ranges, not polarized. Maybe you can already have an image in your mind how that range should look like in those line graphs. I won't draw it for now, maybe later. Just wide ranges. We will work on the example where we are the big blind versus anyone who open race. I don't care about position. And we do call a flop bet. We check call, and then the turn goes check, check. So we pretty much call all kinds of stuff and maybe get some added nuts on the turn or then on the river. Maybe villain does the same, but he decides to check back the turn, and then we see that river card. So villain's range is wide. Our range is wide. Both those ranges contain all kinds of hand strengths. Villain might have rivered some kind of nuts on the river. We might have slow played something, maybe turn something, maybe rivered something. We definitely have top pairs, two pairs, middle pairs, bottom pairs, everything. So now it's very, very important to make that overall evaluation of the board run out for your range to see like, okay, queen five, six, deuce three, probably good for you. Queen five, six, king ace ace probably not good for you so that is what i mean like to really think about okay what do i do now to then already know okay i have a clear advantage here i can go a little crazy or not to then think okay how to put structure in your range and yeah again as pretty much any coaching, the lookalike and the dice principle both will help us a lot. Just thinking about, I have value, what's the next best hand villain could have? High frequency that I try to get the most value out. It's like, is he raising against the block bet? Is he betting if I check to him? Is he calling a small bet only or might he call an over bet? And so on and so on. And then especially for the bluffs, well, does that look like my block value bets? Does that look like my over bets? Whatever. So yeah, now I came up with a little example. Let me just check that first here. No. Okay. So next question in Kahoot if I find it. Now let's just see who is going to the top after that mastery here. Never more. Here we go. Fair fight. All right. Oh, I didn't know. All right. This is our board. Queen, six, five, deuce. Very speed run. On which card does the big blind have the highest block bet frequency? Sorry, I should have told you before. This is under the gun versus big blind. You see our flock calling range. On which card does the big blind have the highest block bet frequency? Give it a random guess. All right, so that was very tough in the time, but it would be tough anyways with any time I would give you because it's very, very close. And that is the point of the question. So you can be happy for being one of the lucky four people that got it right. That's obviously nice. Nice. But I will show you in the next slide here how that is actually distributed. So this year on the bottom right, that picture here, you can see three or four different colors. But all the red colors, they stand for a bet size. The very, very light red is the block bet size. The medium red is the normal 75% size. And the dark red is the 150% over bet. So now it is not like after polarizing the last spots we looked at where it was like, yeah, 40% block bet on the king, but none on the deuce and always all in on that card and always block bet on that card. It's not like that. We are playing wide ranges. And as I wrote before already, on all those runouts, all the river cards, we have all kinds of hand strength with everything. if the river is a king or an ace or a jack or something, we have a straight, we have a two pair, we might have a turn set, we might have whatever. We have top pairs, medium pairs, bottom pairs. So there is not too much of a difference. It actually took me quite a while to figure out that the queen, and I didn't look for the suits because it was so freaking dead even, to find that this has the highest block bet frequency. But here you see the numbers even 27, 21, 22, 20, 26, the 30.89, 31, 3, 5 here. I think the queen of hearts is our winner. Is that because queen X is more likely to be check raised on the flop? I think it's not more likely that it's check raised. It just, the main thing is that it increases the value of all our small peers, the 6x, the 5x, because I think it's the main thing is that under the gun does not improve at all. This is the main point by guess, right? But we'll take a deeper look. So yeah, now what is important? We are talking structure now, because now we have learned on any freaking river card, we need all kinds of sizes. Damn it, right? This is tough to find a shortcut. So we need to get an idea what fits in which sizing, talking about the block bed, obviously, especially today. And yeah, I try to tackle that topic again with the cornerstones of my range. It doesn't make sense to discuss for ages when a hand is just like indifferent. It doesn't matter, right? But some hands are more incentivized to do one than others. And these are the cornerstones that I try to find. And I try to know them in all the spots. Yeah, absolutely. Nevermore. Absolutely. He has all the ace highs. I have five X, six X, I have sevens, eights, nines, but we both have that. We probably have more queen X as well because, well, the good ones, he keeps betting on the turn and so on. So it's pretty much the low pairs against ace highs. I guess so too. So yeah, coming back to the cornerstones, what I'm looking for, I really thought that through this morning and thought like, okay, I'm always looking for the thinnest value bet. First thought, what's the thinnest hand I want to value bet? And Nevermore gave you a good hint here because this will be one of the questions in a second. So read that carefully. Then I want to know what are actually the hands I want to block bet and then re-race. I have nut advantage here. What was it? Queen, five, six, deuce. I have three, four sometimes. I'm sometimes slow playing pocket sixes. That is super nuts on the river queen. How do I want to play that? And I want to know what is my weakest bluff? Like my, the good old last hope bluff. What is like, yeah, four, seven. I may be check raising on the flop, but what about four, eight? What about seven, eight, seven, nine, eight, nine high? Those bluffs are probably the first one in contention for the block bet, because with wide ranges, the blockers are, I mean, blockers play a role, but not the biggest, biggest, biggest, like in our three bet pot with the flush cards. So here, always remember the lookalike and the dice principle. That helps. If I think about my 9 high, I only need to fold out villain's jack 10 give ups his freaking jack high and i have a clear success if i think about my nine high i only need to fold out villains jack 10 give ups his freaking jack high and i have a clear success if i think about which hands to block bet re-raise it should be a hand that well villain raises against it's like if i bet something and then i want villain to have something that he raises to then re-raise and i should beat that as well so i cannot go too thin i should have correct blockers and so on so now talking about that board again queen five six deuce and then i think we have a certain river card in a second and i'll ask you for a couple of hands whether they are they make sense to block bet or not at all i can tell you already they are either very high frequency block bets or almost 0% block bets. It's really black or white, those questions. And let's see. All right. So which hands fit in a block betting range? Big blamers under the gun after calling a c-bet and turn check, check, and the river is the queen. First river is a queen. Does it make sense to block bet pocket force? 8-6 suited, ace-queen, or a queen-jack? Multiple answers can be correct, obviously. And I think I'm sorry because I clicked 8-6 suited is definitely, definitely true. So it must be my misclick in building the Kahoot. I guess since most of you got the 8-6, it's kind of a fair fight. But the 8-6 is definitely true and should be the highest frequency block bet here. Pocket force, ace-queen erase on the flop, not against under the gun. You can do it 5% or 10%. That's it. It's not nutted enough a hundred big blinds. So if you want, because I chose the same board and positions that I used for my check race coaching, how to build a nut driven check raising ranges. If you want to revisit that, you will get explained perfectly why ace queen is not really a race. It's a low frequency race, but not one that makes a lot of sense. Just more like mixing it. Right. So let's go through Thank you. Ace-Queen is not really a race. It's a low-frequency race, but not one that makes a lot of sense. Just more like mixing in. Right, so let's go through them quickly. What about Pocket Force? They are just too weak. Villain does have some 5x, some 6x. Yes, we get sometimes called by worse. Maybe Villain calls some Ace-Highs, but Pocket Force are just too weak. 8-6 suited is the one we beat all the Ace-Highs. We block Villx. We get called by villains 5-4 and ace 5. So that's just good enough. And this is exactly the cornerstone of my range. Just sad that I misclicked here somehow. This is the thinnest value hand that we are having. Maybe I mean 6-7, something like that. All the 6-x should be more or less the same. Queen-jack doesn't make any sense because that wants to get maximum value out of queen-ten, queen-nine, but mainly tens, nines, eights, sevens, jacks, and all those hands are not really raising. And the problem is once we get raised, even though villain could obviously raise his queen-ten and his queen-nine should only have suited he can have king queen as well so queen jack is actually too weak to then re-raise that would be the big trouble here like misapplying the dice principle ace queen though can work as a small bet getting raised by wicker queen getting raised by whatever and then be strong enough to just freaking rip it in for 100 big blinds all right same question now again for a different river make sure to really read that i will read it out the river and then just i hope i didn't misclick again so 86 suited here was correct most of you got that right ace queen as well think about that part as as well. The river is... Ace Queen as well, think about that part as well. The river is the six, parrying the middle card now, with pocket tens going for a medium thin value, eight six as trips, Ace King high going against other Ace highs, Queen Jack maybe on that six now a good block bet. All right, so the pocket tents, everyone got that, right? What we see here is the very, very, very natural stuff. And you can learn so much from that because you get population reads for free here. This is how people play. They have 10s, they block bet, which is absolutely correct. Ace-King is way too weak. That's like the pocket force from the last example. We are blocking Ace-Highs, get called. We want to get called by worse Ace-Highs on that board. I mean, that's freaking ambitious. Queen-Jack again is trying, same spot, is trying to get value from sevens, eights, nines. I mean, can get raised, that's okay, but then it's not strong enough to re-raise. It's like just in between. Queen-jack is the clearest like 75 or even overbet of all times. And eight-six suited for some reason is a very, very good block bet because villains should against a block bet raise any queen-axe. And any six that we are having, having we are playing against under the gun villain doesn't have many sixes it's good enough to freaking go crazy with it all right so let's just have a have a quick view how that looks like in the simulation uh i think i have it here somewhere oh it's not prepared here six here queen six five so i guide you through the hand quickly we check full range out of position villain c that's only small sizing not super super super high frequency but quite sometimes we have a very very high check raise frequency ace queen is sometimes in there but does not really like it reasons you find in theraise coaching. So this time we are calling. The turn was, what was it? Actually, I forgot. I think the deuce of hearts goes check, and then villain polarizes. So his check back means he has something like king, queen, or worse, kind of. So check, check. River was the six of hearts. And now we go through the couple of hands pocket tens clearest block bet of all times we block bet nines call eights call sevens call five x calls oh six x is nuts king five calls some ace highest calls call very nice we have queen jack block bet yeah it's just not making money. The hand is too strong for a block bet and not strong enough for a block bet in a way. So if we block bet here, Dylan raises queen 10, yes, but then we can only call kind of being a catcher, whatever. Well, if we bet big ourselves, Dylan snap calls those worse hands, has a problem with his jacks, 10s, 9s. We get the maximum out of that. So perfect hand strength in that way. Then what was the other option? Ace, King, obviously just garbage to bet ever. We beat all Ace, Highs. That goes check, check against. If we bet, we get called by pretty much better only. And some Ace, Jack, Ace, 10s, but that's not enough. And now, interesting. Okay, a very good question. Yachu, what do we do with seven, eight or seven, nine or eight, nine? I discount seven, eight here because I'm pretty much check raising that a hundred percent on the flop. So I'm looking more at seven, nine and eight, nine. And what we see here is just very, very clear that these are just additions. They need to fit to our value heads. And here I like to use the lookalike principle here. I can play it like 8-9 looks like pocket 9s and pocket 8s. So block bet makes a lot of sense. Villain folds king-jack and king-10 and ace-10, and that's a big success. Makes totally sense. I could say my 8-9 looks like queen-9 and queen-8. I'm betting 75% with that. Makes totally sense. Those hands are just additions, right? So here it's more, I use the lookalike that villain cannot use his blockers or anything. And this is how it works. Here, it's like that 8-6 suited was I guess the other example. Well, it has the plan to get money in the middle. That's the thing. And we can do that by checking and check raising. We can do that by block betting and re-raising, or we can just overbet ourselves. Where here, the preferred one is actually the block bet, while with ace high, I like, again, the lookalike, right? Ace highs are mainly checking, so my ace six wants to check as well. Eight six, well, so so the six i cannot play with the lookalike because six are always trips so the eight what is the eight doing well the eight is mainly block betting same for the nine right so anything can it's not wrong here to to whatever bet bet another amount i think like the 75 to only have queen x call and not win the maximum from that doesn't make any sense but this year we get we block bet we get raised by any queen we get raised by bluffs and then we just freaking re-raise to a good amount boom right so this is just what we can do for example all right all right so for example we put a7 in the same range here when we block the six seven a6 suited of villain right of villain, right? Very, very specific stuff then. Look at the 8-7 of diamonds. We can block bet that. Villain is raising, but we know he doesn't have 6-7 of diamonds and he doesn't have 8-6 of diamonds. Then we have an awesome re-raise. But this is theory world. People are playing very different ranges up to here. Do we think in practice under the gun would raise queen X after we block bet on a six river after checking back the turn? This is the perfect point. So far we are at my question number one. What would be right? We're trying to understand that. The question number two is what is villain doing wrong? And I think you're very, very much on the right track. Just saying no, people are not raising light enough here. So then we need to think about what's the answer to question number three. What is the right exploit? Well, the right exploit would be just we need to overbet ourselves. Thank you. saying, no, people are not raising light enough here. So then we need to think about what's the answer to question number three. What is the right exploit? Well, the right exploit would be just we need to overbet ourselves. So check raise or block bet, re-raise, overbet. The only goal is to get money in the middle. Why does Boto? I don't understand that question. I guess it's a bit unintuitive to put Queen mid kicker in a big bet range because the obvious advantage we have is six X. So we tend to only structure our big bet range around that. Why does bottom set mainly check, I guess, look alike? I mean, deuces, all the deuce X are checking. Fives are like playing like all the fives and sixes are block betting all the time because they are playing like the six X. That's my easiest explanation. It just makes sense that you know the structure of your range and was villain strat versus check well betting obviously any queen and then some of the peers for some blocker reasons where i would just say like i'm i'm betting jacks and not checking that always whatever right so three three four four don't take that for two like we are on the river and we have certain theory-based solves on flop and turn. And this, everything here is only true if what happened before really did take place. So I'm not a big fan of going into detail in river sims too much. For me, it's important to understand structure, right? So something like here, hey, I block bet those. So I take my drips with the same kicker and i block bet those as well it makes a lot of sense if i want to do that i here i think about okay i i want to attack villains random pockets and give them trouble this is the next worst stuff so i'm using the 75 percent bet if i'm this year the stronger queen x go for the overbet then i can look at the bluffs whatever king 10 suited well how do i play my king queen and my queen 10 whatever i can go big or i can overbet makes a lot of sense but i will never block bet king 10 for example just this is very important right knowing exactly three three four four is check so three six and four six is check, six, four just seems slightly too, I mean, not too weak. It's like indifferent. The kicker is still placed. So Willem calls, like the only difference between seven, six and six, four is, oh, sorry, there's the trips. I was in the last board. Yeah, you're perfectly right. Threes and fours check, six, four, six, three, check. Just like finding those little golden rules to structure your own range. If I change, and this is very important, if I change small things on flop and turn, this can look totally different, but it will always make sense in itself. This is important that you don't end up there being that typical player. I bet small, he has a medium showdown value, weak showdown value, right? To sometimes have this here against capable opponents or to realize hey this is exactly how your how your villains play it's like when they bet small there they always have pocket nines and nothing else well then i can freaking raise my pocket jacks right it's just like this here really what would be right i try to give you a guideline here what is villain doing wrong trying to figure that out based on our knowledge and then finding the exploits all right key takeaways oh nice that's good i thought it's one more thing let's see what the what i think maybe that was the last kahoot question as well just double check for the winner yeah podium here we go nevermore nice you were on the top in the beginning now fighting back so very nice thanks for everyone in the kahoot and now let's talk about kind of a little little summary there keep going if there are if there are any more questions right don't leave just because the the quiz is over and yeah we were talking about structure how important it is in the wide range spot, knowing the cornerstones, the thinnest value bet, the hands that want to block re-raise, the weakest bluffs you're having. Use the lookalike and the dice principle. Very, very important. So now the little summary, I showed you two different spots where we apply the block bet. After polarizing, our range is very, very special. We build our range, very polarized, air and value on the turn or some other street, and then something happens on the river. There is some change, and that makes it necessary or beneficial for us to use a block bet. Or we play wide ranges. Then it doesn't matter which cards come because we will always have all kinds of stuff and need to sort them, right? Build our wardrobe, put things in the right compartments. That's our job then, right? Understanding that. Dice principle helps me the most there actually. And maybe the lookalike for the bluffs. Use your guidelines for those. And I hope you got some out of the guidelines I presented today. And just saying again, the block the block bet is a very very very powerful weapon for all sorts of hands in the right situation i started playing poker more than 10 years ago something like a block that didn't exist betting like people were laughed at that bet less than half pot right now everyone bets like 20 pot on the flop and we bet like sometimes 10% on the river or some high stakes people start donking, min donking on turns. We're like, yes, maybe that happens from recreational players in tournaments as well. But actually it makes sense. And it is like Solver confirmed those lines. So it's a very, very powerful weapon. And the understanding of how game theory works out of position, that actually everything we do is kind of a bet. Bet of zero or bet of 5% is not a big difference. It's just those $5 or 5 cents or whatever. So this is important to understand. And now I want to leave room here because I knew I would be like crushing the time pretty much. Didn't add a slide for exploitative thoughts myself. So I want to leave it kind of an open end. I will open a thread in the cash game area where I will put some stuff in, and I hope you do so too, maybe some hands as well, to share that. What are people doing wrong? What should we change compared to theory? I'm mainly playing higher stakes, and I can easily say people are not raising thinly enough. People are not bluffing enough against block bets. How do we tackle that? What else could we do? I could say the same thing. If people raise against block bets, they actually underfold, right? Because they are value heavy. And once I do something, then no matter the sizings, they kind of end up calling, exaggerating a little. But that's like my first thoughts regarding exploitative. Maybe you have more. I would like to see some discussion going on there. Maybe some fancy hands you played. And yeah, that's it. Best of luck at the tables. And then see you the next time from my new office in Vienna. And yeah, let's hope, fingers crossed that everything goes well.
