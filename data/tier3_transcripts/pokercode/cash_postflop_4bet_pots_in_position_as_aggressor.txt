### TOPIC: cash postflop 4bet pots in position as aggressor
 Today's video is going to be about playing the four-bet pot as the aggressor in position. In the latest video I've shown you how I make a difference between the two situations that we are facing when deciding pre-flop to four-bet in position. Facing either a linear range or a somewhat mixed polarized whatever big blind range and how to adjust correctly when playing certain player types. Now on the flop we actually can forget a little about that because the calling part of each of those different kinds of ranges should look quite similar. And actually this will be a pretty easy video and I will follow up with a couple of post flop examples then and hand histories Because it's not the toughest thing in the world to play the four bad pot in position correctly Especially when being the aggressor, but now let's start all over again Let's have a look at what the spot is that we are in the spot is the following We do open race either early position middle position cutoff or button. We do face a 3-bet from the blinds. Again, I've shown you how I make a difference between getting 3-bet from the small blind or from the big blind. This is very, very, very important pre-flop. Now, we did 4-bet. We decided to go with our hand, put in a 4-bet. We either have a very strong value hand or something, yes, let let's call it a bluff even though we should have still strong equity against any calling range and this is what happens we get called and now there is a flop and we need to make some decisions how to continue playing for me the most important thing when trying to figure out the right play there is first of all having the awareness for the actual ranges. And here comes some thoughts into play right away because everyone is very different when it comes to calling four bets. Yes we can have a look at certain charts from some solvers and so on but is this how people play in reality? Are they actually just having J and A suited all the time? Or what is it like? This is the first thing we need to really evaluate when seeing the player, when seeing his call for bet and actually knowing about our for betting range in the first place as well. Did we start having bluffs preflop there? Or are we actually on value only against certain player types? I still want to know that post-flop. I want to play the ranges that are really in that spot and not some theoretical construct that is whatever just on the paper. And now my first thing that we discussed often already in other spots is how do I proceed here. Usually the one who puts in the forebet is the guy with the stronger range. So mainly the action is on us. We are in the action game. And I always want to start that with targeting villains weakest. And now this is important. Weakest equity part. I'm not interested in hands that are freaking drawing dead, right? If the board is ace, king not thinking about attacking villains five six suited without anything it's more about okay is it worth to fall out something right do i have still bluffs in that spot that's a king high board i might have ace queen villain has jacks i can start targeting that villain might have sevens we might have six seven suited and still that part has equity against, well, quite some of my hands. So this is what I try to look out for when looking for the correct seabed sizings. And now secondly, I want to look a little into the future in the game tree. What is the villain supposed to do with the biggest part of his range? If he has an overpair, if he has a toppeer, should he slow play that? Should he fast play? What is actually my range part that he wants to play against? Is he just in check call mode, bluff catching even with his strongest hands? Or is he actually building a value range, adding bluffs, denying equity from other hands that I might have my range., missed bluffs for example. So these are the main points I try to look at and I can already tell you this will lead to the same strategy on most of the boards actually. I just made a couple of examples before we jump into the real action to show you how that leads to a certain strategy. Let's start with example number one, a very dry King high board, King nine, deuce rainbow, let's say we are button versus small blind, the spot that should occur the most often. So we did format from the button, small blind decides to flat. And here you see the solver output already without me showing you the exact simulation but we see that pretty much full range with either a quarter pot or a 10 sizing by doing so we obviously fold out stuff like six seven suited which is a success because our bluffing hands like ace jack ace queen are there. They actually, well, 6-7 suited has quite some equity against those hands. And we make Willem's mid-peers indifferent. If Willem has 8s, 7s, 6s, 5s, or something like that, well, he can't do much against those small bets. And well, if you think about our bluffing range, like ace-queen, ace-jack, suited aces, they still have something going for them, right? Backdoor straight draw, maybe backdoor flush draw and over a card. So actually they want to realize some equity there. And yeah, betting everything is pretty nice. And now the next step is how should villain react to that? And actually he should react to that by check raising quite a lot. And if you think what hands villain wants to continue king x nine x gut shots they have a big benefit in raising because they are not trying to check call check call and maybe get a bad run out to finally get away from something like king queen that's a spot like in four bad pots with a very very low stack to pot ratio we We just need to accept some of the coolers. If villain has aces and we have king-queen here, the money goes in the middle. The question is just what's the best way to do so. So here out of position mainly thinks about what is the other range part that he's playing against. How to play king-queen the best versus pocket jacks, pocket tens. How to play the best versus ace seven suited. How to play the best versus ace jack suited. Something like that. And I mentioned that already all those hands have quite some equity still against a king just by having an over card or a backdoor straight draw and so on. So mint check raising can make a lot of sense and is actually solver confirmed here. We do some calling obviously as well but this shows you already that in position is not necessarily incentivized to start betting big because villain is helping by putting in some raises. If we have pocket aces yes it feels great to bet bigger and get it in against the king but we should get that done anyways. So it's really about attacking that weakest part, allow villain to add bluffs as well and then go from there. If villain starts calling here we can already think about what is happening on the turn. On the turn most cards do not change too much. Yes there might be a straight getting there, that villain has super low frequency. Anything between eight and a three 3 or the deuce itself is a full brick. So this is usually the point where in position just starts polarizing. I have a king or a batter in a way that wants to stack off. So very easily explain what the strategy looks like on a board like that. Let's jump to the next one. Another example, 7-deuce-deuce rainbow. Like the full brick board, no one hits anything. So if we think about how do ranges play here, on the one side we have the aggressor having aces, kings, queens, as well as ace-king, ace-queen, ace-jack, maybe some king-queen. So either super strong pairs or well a draw to a super strong pair, right? Having usually six outs to hitting a top pair on the turn. On the other side We have the caller who well sure sometimes might trap aces But mainly he has the medium pockets like Jacks, 10s, 9s, 8s that are not ready to stack off preflop But want to see a flop first and obviously I forgot about the all the no like a queen-jack suited, 10-9 suited, queen-10 suited, king-jack suited and so on, ace-queen offsuit. So now it's the question how as the in position player, how do we get the most out of that board? We want to achieve a couple of things. We want to first make sure to get the money in the middle. If we have kings and villain has jacks we need to get the money in the middle before there's an ace on the turn for example. Another thing is if we have ace king, ace queen and villain has something like jack ten suited, ten nine suited we want to deny equity. Those hands still have about 25% equity against our hand just hitting their pair on the turn. So this is what we want to attack in the first place and now the good thing comes that well we do not need to have multiple strategies here to achieve two very different things because we achieve that with the exact same strategy of betting somewhat small targeting villains jack ten suited type of equity hand so because villain if he has a middle pair like jacks and tens and nines he has the big problem that either he's drawing dead to two outs against our better over here or he is actually has the the necessity to deny equity because our king queen offsuit our ace queen offsuit that is the major part of our bluffing range pre-flop has decent equity against his jacks while having position and great equity realization therefore so pocket jacks here are actually highly incentivized to race which helps our kings and queens because we can be sure we get the money in the middle if villain is not doing that well then we over perform with our bluffs that still have great equity so it's like nothing nothing bad can really happen. So here we see the thing. We have a clear range bet with anything for a certain sizing, whether that is 20%, 25% exactly. It doesn't matter too much. And villain's strategy is, well, to deny equity when he wants to continue. Actually, he's raising more than he's calling in that spot. Obviously, there are some calls as well, but raising is the main strategy here. All right, let's have a look at a third very different example. And let's go for a board that is like as drawy as it could get. Like 10-9-8 with a flush draw. Villain has now sets. Villain has now something like king-jack, ace-jack, king-queen. King-10 suited, like anything that connects with the board. Ace, queen, obviously having two overs and a gut shot. And yeah, now what changes is that first of all, out of position could maybe have some donks. I will skip that for now, right? Have a donk bet, target ace, king right away, something like that. Just saying, hey, I'm actually having more strong hands here. But this is not what happens in real life too often. So let's think about the continuation betting strategy for in position here. And yeah, again, what's the plan of something like pocket jacks? It's probably just getting the money in the middle. Pocket queens, pocket kings, the same thing. While king, queen, ace, jack, ace, queen have partly the problem that, well have equity but against the race they are doing poorly so what to do with those and again we want to look at how villain should react mainly here and here is a pretty clear answer that villain doesn't have any hands that are interested in raising small because anything he wants to raise has just too much equity if he has like a flush draw or he has like an ace-jack type of hand or a jack-10 kind of I have a pair plus an open-ender kind of an equity bump, they just want to get all the money in the middle. So Willem's reaction here is mainly to be jamming. And yeah, that tells us right away, okay, you don't want to give him a great risk-reward if he's jamming anyways. So even though a hand like pocket queens might like to bet slightly bigger against the calling range it's not necessary because villain will help if villain has jacks or jack 10 he should put the money in himself so it's really yeah not doing us a favor if we just bet big ourselves it turns our hand a little face up and actually by betting smaller we save money with our bet folds while achieving the same thing with our value hands so obviously that board is not as good as the others before for our range and we need to drop down in frequency we need to really only go medium frequency select hands well that want to bet I like to be very polarized there have like either a bad snap bad call or a bad snap fold and this is how we should play a board like that and having the first impression with those three examples summarizing that a little again and then jumping into some real hands that I played review those and see what I might have done wrong or did correctly and how I see those hands now reviewing them actually for the first time. I like to do that stuff unprepared so let's see. And first the little summary. It's a very easy video actually. Even though it is about four bad pots the strategy is not tough at all as the aggressor in position at least not on the flop. But it's all about the evaluation of the ranges that get to that spot. It's, well, the game tree is not tough. It's like for a solver it's the easiest thing to solve so it should be quite easy for ourselves. But knowing the right input is the key here. And we can summarize it like that, that a small bet is just our standard flop play. Whenever we do something else it's either an exception or some kind of exploit. Usually villain has many no-hits we want to attack. We four bet small in position so villain has a great price to just see a flop. This will lead to him calling some hands like suited connectors, like peers, and on most boards they are, well, they didn't hit anything and therefore there is a snap fold part that we want to attack often villain is incentivized to raise himself even though he's not the favorite in the hand this is just because of how our bluffing part is structured i see that from students over and over again that they want to protect too much they They want to bet big and so on. We are in a 4-bet pot that is just not necessary. That comes from, oh, sing raise pot, get the money in now and so on. But we are playing very, very low SBRs here. So we either realize equity with our bluffing part or villain is raising it now. So here it's really the thing we need to understand the incentives for villain of how he should continue to then figure out do we need to put in the money ourselves with the nuts because villain is not helping or should we just bet small keep our range together and let him do the job to get the money in which well benefits our value hands. And in the end the sizing usually stays the same just some few exceptions it's really the board structure that just dictates our frequency if the board is really good for us it's very very often that we can bet full range if it's not that great for us well we drop down in frequency to something like 50 percent or something like that and the last thing before coming to some actual hands here is what I like doing in game the most. First, know the input. Adjust drastically versus face up calling ranges. If someone is just calling Jax and Ace Queen suited, put him on freaking Jax and Ace Queen suited. I don't need to stack off aces on a Jack high board then. There's no money and there are people like that. Jacks, Tens, Ace-Queen suited is a major, it's a key player here, right? If the board is Jack-Ten-Deuce, dangerous, right? Against people who have wide calling ranges, that's actually a great board for us. And then this, the other part, who do not play for bad pots well. It's just like they are used to Sing-Ra high sbrs they take their do their check calling check calling go from there they are scared of us having aces so against those it's very very important to size up with the vulnerable value hands those hands that are nuts now but not later like pocket queens on 10 9 8 if someone is not getting in his jack 10 and his jacks we need to get the money in before there's any any other scare card. Yeah we have awesome equity against all his potential calling range and then this is something that in theory we don't need to do but is the perfect exploit against that. And now in the next part I will check out a couple of hands I played and will review them. Whether I chose a strategy that I liked, in which way I deviated and why, and maybe just some reviews where I potentially made some mistakes. Let's have a look, see you in the next video!
