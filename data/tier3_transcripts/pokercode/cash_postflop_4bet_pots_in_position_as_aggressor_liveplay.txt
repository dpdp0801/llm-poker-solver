### TOPIC: cash postflop 4bet pots in position as aggressor liveplay
 Welcome to the first Praxis part of the little 4-betting series. Today I will review a couple of spots where I played a 4-bet pot in position as the aggressor. In the last theory video you've learned a little about which sizes make sense on the flop, mainly a small one, and as well how to adjust versus certain player types. So I want to guide you through a couple of hands now that I played a couple of months ago actually. I'm just seeing January here. It's May right now, 2022. So let's have a look at those, how I think about them now, what I think my thoughts were, and if I'm unsure, I'm actually ready to have a look on how the solver would play. Let's start with this one here. I have a king-9 suited on the button facing a big blind three bet from someone who is a regular in the zoom 200 games. So yeah, I expect him to have a somewhat decent three betting range, maybe even had some sample on him that decided that I want to have some bluffs here in that spot. Again, big blind range is always a little cautious, people are are too tight so bluffing can be quite costly at some point but here I went for it. Go for a small four bet size, attack like his weakest part, he needs to fold out something like king ten king jack offsuit anyways if he has that with some frequency and he should continue with all kinds of peers suited connectors broadways and so on. We get a pretty brickish flop sure there's a flush draw and there's some straight connectivity but besides four five and maybe the occasional ace four ace five suited there is not much going on it's all about the queen pretty much i have ace queen myself villain has ace queen my kings and aces are nuts obviously jack's ten still doing fine my ace king having equity against pretty much anything while having nice blockers to his ace queen king queen so i think i can start betting with pretty high frequency with our preferred very small sizing i go for 25 percent here i guess and go from there and i attack something what should he do with sevens now what should he do with well seven eight of hearts obviously folding. What does he do with ace jack of hearts? So there are lots of hands that I just give trouble to with that exact sizing and going directional in we can do that at a later point. So here villain unfortunately finds the call and the turn is my peer. And now is the first really, really interesting spot because we need to evaluate how good is my nine here. Which hands is villain calling on the flop? I know in theory that villain should check raise most queen X. Pretty much all the ace queens he should be check raising. If that is happening, my nine can be quite strong here. And I think I have a good bet to then check back most rivers but in reality i don't think that people play that aggressively in four bad pots so i've given way more queen x than he should have probably so i think i decided to check back and yeah now on that two pair river that where the flush gets there i'm obviously super happy now beating any queen obviously beating jacks and tens i don't know how likely they are to catch having spades maybe so yeah definitely getting the money in in the middle here happily oh yeah let's see what happens villain checks to me i guess he should have some traps because i will start value betting any king and i will add bluffs to that so not that necessary for him to to jam too much even though he needs to have a betting range if he has four five if he has backdoor clubs and they didn't get there I think he needs to bluff at some point here and yeah I'm obviously value jamming and he unfortunately had the trap where we now see how interesting that spot is on the turn it's like how often is he check raising a queen or not? Against this exact hand I would have loved betting obviously. But yeah I'm super happy with my play I think he played it fine as well. Yeah let's let's jump over to the next one. Casual ace king on the button. Now very very different spot because we have a 70 big blind unknown in the big blind and this just stands for a weaker player this is uh yeah not the standard three bet size that people use nowadays it's a little smaller and yeah i'm definitely this can be anything and i'm definitely four betting here for that stack death and happy to get it in happy to play a Yeah, I guess this is a very, very interesting one. So we have someone who 3-bet calls here. Who is potentially a recreational player. Yeah, I can tell you the strategy already. This is a board that we should only c-bet small. We should attack like 6s, 7s, 8s, 5s suited and so on. And I think this is one that we can use in exploitative bigger sizing as well. People should get in their money in high-end luxe shoes here quite often with something like king-ten, king-queen all the time, maybe even just jamming queen-jack, jack-ten, having all this equity. And this is something that I didn't experience too much, especially in the lower buy-ins and especially from recreational people. those hands are never folding so i'm happy to see both either a small bet but i like the exploit of a bigger bet i'm not sure how aware i was here in when was that january as well so yeah let's see yeah i go i go for the half pot and i quite like it so yeah we see that for the first time we have the theory size on the one hand on the other hand I think it makes a lot of sense to size up what does he do if he has pocket tens what does he do if he has ace jack like definitely not folding so I maximize my value here by betting betting a little bigger now and giving myself the opportunity to jam a turn for like half pot left he found the fold all right let's go to the next one another ace king this time a very decent large three bet sizing from the big blind exactly 100 big blinds deep i go for a small four bet here as well i'm sometimes calling i'm sometimes four betting the bigger the three bet sizes the more i like the four bet jamming could be an option as well at some point depends on yeah how sure i am of this three betting range do i price in lots of four five suited five six suited or am i rather tackling lots of king jack suited ace jack suited ace queen off type hands that i like to keep in it's like lots of questions asked at the same time so yeah let's go from there and king seven four board i guess pretty standard high c-bet, a small sizing and no other option than that. No, it doesn't make sense to split your range and check back a lot here. I think it can make sense to have even a smaller sizing because we had a little large preflop sizings. It's just 1.5 SBR, not even. And we can go from there. Anything between 15 and 25%, I would would consider a good sizing here and i actually size down for my 25 hotkey to a little smaller i like to see that here reacting to that exact spot and get another fold so i just kind of randomized those hands in after filtering for it and just went by sorted by time to not only have big pots and small pots so this is actually all four bad pots from that session or from that week or something like that yeah we see the folding it's a great spot to be in ace queen offsuit this time we're getting a small blind three bet we've learned in the theory video that usually small blind three bets from regulars are very very fixed ranges because-bet only, which makes a lot of sense. And then they just don't miss out on any 3-bets, right? You sit there with ace-10 offsuit and think about, do I fold or do I 3-bet? King-jack offsuit, same thing. Pocket 6s, pocket 5s, which is like, those are all the lines for like the borderline hands to 3-bet or not. So it's just people won't miss out on them. And that means at the same time, I want to be sure to have those bluffs. And Ace-Queen is a great candidate here to either call or sometimes 4-bet. In a way, I select the hands I want to play against because if I 4-bet, villain will jam Ace-King 100%. So I make sure to never play against Ace-King. And once he calls, I'm actually doing quite well. Like I have any hand dominated. King-Queen suited hand dominated king queen suited ace jack suited obviously i flip against peers i'm good favorite against all kinds of suited connectors so if he jams i have a big problem and i snap fold unfortunately but if he calls it's actually a great spot for me and here he ended up calling and now it's a very very interesting spot jack nine three and yeah i will actually run that on the side to have a look at how to play that board and you will see it probably in a second what it turned out to be so far so good while the solver is running let's just have a look at how i played the hand i think we have ace jack ourselves in our bluffing range we have something like king queen that definitely doesn't want to bet fold but betting seems reasonable as well. So I would make a difference between two player types here against players that are not check-raising very very very high frequency and definitely just see betting full range. I can attack pocket eights, pocket sevens, pocket sixes, the low suited connectors and even something like pocket tens, ace- really unsure how to continue here having a club i prefer the c-bet even more just take some check jams away that villain might have and i expect that i did c-bet here with a standard small water pot sizing let's see six of hearts as a full break on the turn so here's the situation where i definitely start polarizing a little and either go for value or have a clear bluff like ace queen with the queen of clubs was not really bluff on the flop it's more like preparing the situation so now it's the question what is the perfect sizing is this is it the linear sizing directional in which kind of hands do i want to attack i think we are attacking something like still a 9x pocket tens maybe even pocket eights with a club that did float King Queen King 10 that villain might have if he doesn't fast play it and check raise on the flop yeah I still think having clubs is good here I block calling range like ace queen of clubs might just check call twice which is always good and I do not block any of the snap falls like i guess a king 10 of hearts pocket eights maybe something like that so i expect actually that i did bet here but i'm unsure yeah i went for another quarter pot which is interesting and i think yeah we got the fold here so another small bet and we have the great fold equity on our side and now it's i guess a perfect word to just look up what the solver tells us. And here we are, I guess, solved to quite a good accuracy. And obviously we start without donking in that spot here, even though I offered all kinds of things. And this is what we see here. And this kind of confirms my thought process for a second. So there is a small size, the quarter pot. The half never a thing just jamming is never a thing but it's not full frequency because we have so many hands that hate bet folding like king queen something like a queen nine suited as a bluff ace nine really doesn't want to bet and then face anything ace king pretty much the same thing ace queen is indifferent as well we don't see a clear preference regarding clubs or not clubs. So yeah let's go from here and first see what villain's reaction should be. It's one of the mixed boards. It's like remember from the theory video the one example was 10-9-8 with a flush draw where villain only wanted to check jam all his high equity bonds. The other board was something like king-9-deuce deuce rainbow where villain wanted to do lots of min check raising this is kind of a combination between those two and the reaction of villain here is a combination of that as well villain wants to check jam something like ace five of clubs it's like just folding out some kind of ace queen folding out some kind of whatever getting called by other flush draws doing equity wise well against anything makes a lot of sense it wants to well check raise aces to not like the slow plate aces to not give away any more free cards but actually we want king queen to float to maybe hit the top here and stack off something like that so what about ace jack kind of indifferent it's like depending on the suits do we want to just get it in or min check raise to allow more hands to float so here we Thank you. So what about ace-jack? Kind of indifferent. It's like depending on the suits, do we want to just get it in or mint check-raise to allow more hands to float? So here we see, okay, it's a pretty fancy follow-up strategy by villain. So he ended up calling here and the turn was the six of hearts. And I'm interested in my strategy here. Apparently, what kind of I expected now looking at it, my quarter pot sizing is not a thing. And we are polarizing here. We either have something good or we have nothing. So whenever polarizing directional in, this is the sizing we should take, which here is just like preparing a river jam to have the same sizing on turned river, which is just slightly bigger. It's just like, what is it like third pot, little over third pot. This is just the thing in those already big pots with a low stack to pot ratio and now let's have a look at the hands value is pretty easy we have a jack or better like king jack plus queens and then the bluffs let's see ace queen we see like small preference towards having a club and not having spades right villain is floating spades with the backdoor flush draw on the flop so we want to unblock that because these are his folds now having clubs is definitely a good thing so i liked my my ace queen play here i just took the slightly wrong sizing and just to to confirm what is happening there i always like to have a look at what are we actually attacking we attack ace queen which needs to fold we attack king queen which well is in big trouble we ace queen, which needs to fold. We attack king queen, which, well, is in big trouble. We attack king ten, which needs to fold. We attack pocket tens and pocket eights. So, and this is actually, right, on the offsuit side, this is quite a lot of combinations relative to the rest of the range. So, yeah, something to learn from all those small pots, right? The flop feeling was good here. I'm happy with that. The turn, I messed up the sizing a little, but the thought process was good and the hand choice is fine as well. And yeah, it's just very, very tough now to evaluate Villain's whole four-bet range to then evaluate how much of that he needs to fold on the flop on the turn and how much he needs to stack off to have any idea whether he's over-folding. Or we could say, maybe he's a super nit and just calls 10s, jacks and ace-queen suited versus a 4-bet. He calls down jacks and folds 10s at some point and obviously folds ace-queen depending on the suits. Then it's a totally different game than someone who calls 6s, 7s, 8s, 9s, 10s, jacks, all the super broadways and so on. This is the tough part of that. Let's have a look at one more. Ace-10 offsuit. I remember that player as a pretty tight one so I'm surprised that I ended up forebetting here. Maybe I was a little in love with my chart instead of just saying I'm not bluffing here or I have bad memory here. But yeah this is a board. Villain either has a pair and is forced to fast play against exactly those hand types. If villain has pocket eights he doesn't want to give me three cards. I can check back on the turn, have another two cards for free and give him a brutal decision on most run outs. So no need to use a big sizing ever here. While a small sizing accomplishes a lot. If he has like queen jack of spades what is he going to do right? I'm super protected so i think i can go medium to high frequency with a small bet here and it gets people who i don't expect to check raise enough i can almost go or i can just go full frequency this would be one hand that likes checking back sometimes i guess because with the ace of hearts i just hate getting check raised so much yeah i expect myself to be on the c-bet heavy side here. I don't know. Let's see. Yeah, another quarter pot here. I think this is fine. And we get the fold. Pocket kings. Finally, value hand. We see someone to 3-bet. I expect him to be a recreational player now. We have a small 3-bet sizing. We're definitely fast playing our kings. I size up even because I don't expect recreationals to have many three bet folds so i like that size here and have that board which is not necessarily like the 10-9-8 from the theory video example but it's very connected it's something that is very tempting to bet bigger for lots of people who didn't study for bet pots too much and that would be a perfect exploit versus some player types in theory i guess we should mainly see that small i can see like some half pot betting being a thing here as well just targeting pocket tens pocket eights eight nine suited nine ten suited i'm not sure how much they should be raising yeah i'm happy with both i don't have have reads on this guy right now So I can see myself betting half pot or a quarter pot here and I sized up again here Which just means I'm not expecting him to check raise So really so I want to double check on that and show you as well and I will actually run two sims on that one Just like the last one with like all options that I want to have and the second one i just do not allow the big blind to check race at all right i like to have those maximum examples if i'm saying he's probably not check raising enough i want to see first what would be the case if he's not allowed to check race at all do i change my sizing to mainly a bigger one so let's have a look in a second all right let's first have a look at the simulation with all the options. So we've already figured out the board is not that great for in position. Like jack, nine, seven, lots of connectivity, ace, king, ace, queen type hands do not hit. So the main question is here, how often can we see that? And how is it split between smaller sizing? And does a bigger sizing maybe even even exist here given all the high equity hands that in a natural way want to check call from the big blinds calling range so now i'm super super excited to see what's what's going on here and yeah we actually see the bigger size while i guess that was kind of expected that we are not c betting full frequency here so this here is a solver for betting range including this ace king ace queen those no hits aces kings queens yeah sometimes checking back it's not we see already it's like value hands sure but they're 73 dollars in the middle right now and kings are winning like 54 out of that it's not like that they win stacks here all the time and now yeah we see that the big size is already a thing and let's have a look at the reaction versus both those sizes if we bet big villain is just like jamming some hands like jack 10 just the best thing it can do probably pocket aces want to just get it in now before there's a queen 10 8 9 jack whatever and 10. I would have guessed only with the backdoor flush draw, but they all somehow are indifferent between jamming and calling. Against that big sizing, against the small sizing, I guess out of position needs to do some more equity denial against like ace, king, ace, queen. So we see quite some more raising here as well with the smaller sizing. Some king queen Maybe trying to fold out ace king ace queen some 10-8 straight just building a pot While the check min race keeping all kinds of drawing hands in there are just building a pot a little and yeah Maybe the reaction to that is just folding out some ace king and ace queen offsuit Which I guess makes a lot of sense because it has a nice effect and now what i'm super interested in is how does that strategy change if villain is not check raising enough which is something we usually face a lot right we don't see like not that experienced regulars and no no recreational players like using a min check raise here right yes some recreationals do it with the top set but that's about it. So let's have a look at the other simulation where I do not allow those raises. First thing interesting we see a little adaption that it starts donking instead but not really so let's start with a check here for out of position and all of a sudden, wow, this is really a big exploit here here all of a sudden we see 100% c-bet frequency while just the typical hands like to go a little bigger yeah kings queens just getting the money now against all the 10-9 suited jack-10 suited and so on but yeah that makes a lot of sense ace king ace queen those hands that like to yeah realize their equity and therefore check back before sometimes they just go for the bet now because they know well they only can get called while having a little effect of folding out something and then going from there let's say what would happen on a full brick here yeah then on the turn we have the typical 2e sizing linear sizing directional in with pretty much anything that is king jack or better sometimes checking back to protect all the other parts of our range right like a check check and then on another brick they will get the money in the middle while happy happily calling or jamming against the block bed and so on and so on so very interesting thing where we have seen two very very different outcomes in that simulation and this all depends on villains play style and which I didn't change now the input we have first of all if villain only has 9th 10th jacks and ace-queen suited here obviously the play is very differently and this is now where it's really tough to give you a very clear guideline how to play those because well the input will always be different I can show you different ranges have different outcomes so it's about the logic about the thought process that needs to be sound here what happens next against which hands are we making the perfect move or not all right let's go for one more last hand that is i hope interesting i've seen already the action now in the whole manager again we have a regular pretty aggressive regular actually who three bets very large from the small mind people who use three bet only usually are a little on the smaller side because they like getting called in a way but they hate four bets because if he is like three betting all the nine eight suiteds and all the ace jack off suits himself maybe even ace 10 off suit this is fine playing versus all my calling range but against four bets it gets tough so here I'm using the four bet we are slightly deeper this might be the reason actually for his upsize I use like a normal four betting size here and he calls and I remember this guy is super splashy here and yeah 10-deuce three I think he never has deuces never has threes, so it's kind of a brick board. There is the flush draw. Yeah, I'm not sure. And I start off with a c-bet, small c-bet, as pretty much always on those brickish boards. And now we face a non-min check race. And now the question is, how do we follow up on that? I don't even know what he's representing. Foketens is the only nutted hand he has. Some kind of trap. Some kind of ace queen offsuit. Some kind of four five. Some kind of ace five. I'm really unsure. Maybe a flush draw. So let's see what the solver tells us here how to continue. What to do with our jacks? What to do with our queens? What to do with our kings? What to do with our aces? What to do with our ace ten offsuit? What to do with our, what to do with our kings what to do with our aces what to do with our ace 10 offsuit what to do with our i don't know king nine of hearts so i'm super interested in the output here i expect quite some jamming here even though we are in position just for equity deny reasons and then it's the question what are the perfect bluffing hands that we want to add to that so button versus versus small blind for bad pot. All right so let's have a look again we are slightly deeper so that changes things compared to 100 bigs. I put it in like that we again obviously do not have any dunking and now this is the first interesting thing that actually I just learned something. So let me just double check Yes, I just learned something that when we are deeper we actually want to use a slightly bigger size the quarter pot it's not the one to go here anymore because well it seems to to keep us too far away from getting stacks in this is such a no hit board that well if we do that villain is not inclined to check raise so much as he is 400 bigs where he's happily getting it in like here that deep pocket eight sevens are just folding this is not the case 400 bigs so it changes the whole risky war thing and now actually we like using the bigger size to put villain in a more tougher situation with all his vectors and over cards and stuff yeah i didn't know about that super interesting so stack death changing things there as well and anyways now looking what his check raising range should be yes pocket aces okay a little pocket jacks yes trying to stack off maybe against 10x ace 10 king 10 queen 10 suited jack suited. With the flush draw, mint check raise, I don't know. 10-9, maybe some of the pockets. Sixes, fives, fours, ace-five, ace-four. And now our reaction to that is actually 12% jamming there. Jack's just getting it in. Queen's just getting it in. King's just getting it in. Having a heart or not makes a big difference here. Ace-King is an interesting jam. The one with the highest frequency is the ace with a king of hearts added. I guess that just keeps us ahead of all the monster draws, right? We want to have the extra equity with the heart but want to make sure a villain can have something like ace-five of hearts that we actually dominate. And what else? Here, interesting! We have the same, I know the concept from the concept from the ace king jams with the ace axe king of hearts and this is what i did in that hand no clue whether that is still good deeper depends a lot on what villain is check raising i knew that this guy is quite aggressive and i didn't want to just like call fold fold whatever so yeah let's have a look there again ace of clubs jack of hearts i went for the jam got the fold this is probably not recommended on really low stakes but here against aggressive players this is a thing where we can fire back a little and as we have seen we do the same with like jacks queens kings without a heart they have no benefit in in seeing more cards rather get it in against a 10x right now so we want to have bluffs in that range as well that is not just I don't know randomly getting in flush draws all right I guess that works quite some interesting hands and maybe to summarize it again it's kind of an easy spot once you know the inputs then there's lots of small betting starting to go directional in on the turn it's more about out of position how he should continue is there a min check raising is there check jamming is there lots of check calling this is the tougher part It's more about out of position, how he should continue, is there min check raising, is there check jamming, is there lots of check calling. This is the tougher part of the four bet pot and yeah it's like really the key factors are thinking about which range does villain actually start with and how well does he play that. What do I need to expect as his next action with certain hand categories. It's tight ranges you can really start thinking about hand ranks. Right here, 10, deuce, three, think about nines and eights, which he could have. How does he play over-peers? How does he play offsuit hands he might have? What about ace, queen, offsuit? Is he check calling that always? Is he check folding, depending on the size? This really brings you one step forward in those four bad pots, because in the end, it's really about a couple of combinations and playing them as good as possible versus each other so i hope you enjoyed that and learned a little from that and then see you in the next video of that little four bad pot series
