### TOPIC: cash postflop ace high boards
 So welcome everyone who is here already. Topic for today is Ace Highboards in position. I didn't want to have like a huge, huge, huge title, but we're talking about us being the open raiser. What are you doing these days? I mean, this year, I mean, I have mainly like, I have a shift of priorities. So priority number one is my little son, who is about, I don't know whether, my wife is always a little shy in front of the camera, but maybe he comes over to say a goodnight. They are just taking a bath, or he is, and then it's bedtime for him. So that's priority number one. And then priority number two is real life, and priority number three is then this like poker. So i i played on gg this year i played on i know i made videos played on stars for that i played some some random some app stuff as well so um yeah jump and play some games with g jacobi is he playing on gg right now i won't be playing now we'll we'll some theory. Alright, so let's get started. Now time for the coaching. We'll discuss Ace High boards in position. Don't worry. I got my presentation here so I'll mainly look in the camera, but sometimes the chat I have no clue how I get it over from the very very far side of the second screen. Let me maybe try. No like export chat something like that no it just has to stick there somehow let's i try one more time no doesn't help this is really bad it should be like i don't know i'm really bad with that stuff but there should be a way for idiots like me to um to figure it out that i yeah Who's from Cyprus? They were just playing their poker, Yakub Bishvili, he's from Russia I think. So cash or tournament, I think what I'm going to tell today is for everything as always, I try to keep my coaching to pure poker theory, but my examples will be cash game ranges. So if we look something up in GTO Wizard, which we will, it will be about cash game ranges, but everything I teach is working for tournament players as well. I'm just with a different output in the end. All right, so this is, I made up my mind a little yesterday, and actually I have to admit, I talked to one friend of mine who is not a beginner in poker but like playing some lower limits for fun having a real job and asked him what he would expect from a coaching like that because for me it's sometimes tough to not go into like a high stakes players discussion or what can I expect people especially in this public coaching where like have to guess that most people are not members and haven't seen all my videos and so on. So, um, yeah. Um, and I have to say I absolutely failed preparing a session like that. So it might be a little geeky, um, might be very cool for some more experienced players, um, might be, uh, hopefully still cool for, for for beginners I try to put as always everything in very easy words but yeah you can expect a little little tougher session maybe compared to my other ones especially the free coachings that I try to keep as general as possible all right so now you don't see it already split up talking about ace-king and ace-queen board, ace-jack board, ace-ten boards and like no spreadsheets. That's what lots of people do. That's not my way of working. I love to understand things. So we'll talk about how I'm dividing ace-high boards, how I think it makes sense to divide ace-high boards. To have secondly a special look at where our advantage is. I can already tell you that as the open raiser, we will always talk about spots, but we are the open raiser, that we have an advantage all the time. Even on the worst boards, we have an advantage, like some kind of advantage. So we just have to look for where it is and then obviously trying to like um yeah to make use of it as the next step to understand okay how can we reach that point where our advantage really matters and so on um then since i never know how long my coaching sessions go um and i'm very very bad with planning of timing um i got a couple of examples prepared i think we only get through one or two but i got the third one as well very different ones and happy Thank you. and I'm very, very bad with planning of timing. I got a couple of examples prepared. I think we only get through one or two, but I got a third one as well, very different ones. I'm happy to show you how I made my personal game plans there. To finish things, wrap it up with key takeaways as always. All right, so those nuts make me freaking thirsty. So I shouldn't forget that. Maybe you hear it, I'm still pretty, pretty sick. So I that this is over like for nine days already. I was a little scared that I need to postpone this one But yeah, I think I'm fit enough for today, and I hope that on Thursday. I will I'll be on the on the road to see friends and family for the Christmas vacation, and I hope that will be fine Alright, so let's start. How to divide a-side boards. I told you already I'm not a spreadsheet guy. Obviously you can run reports, you can look it up, you can make Ace-King-Deuce, Ace-King-3, Ace-King-4, Ace-King-5, Ace-King-6, Ace-King-7 and so on and so on and write down frequencies of sizings frequencies and sizings different c-bet strategies and so on which is cool but you can figure out in that way which sizings make sense unfortunately with no understanding if you do that with the next step trying to understand why certain sizings make sense on certain boards that is a great tool like different way of learning works perfectly for others it's not my way i want to understand first Thank you. to understand why certain sizings make sense on certain boards. That is a great tool, like different way of learning works perfectly for others. It's not my way. I want to understand first, then build my logic, and then we get to a certain sizing. So how am I dividing ASI boards? It's something I cannot even give you a list for that, right? Because I think about different things, right? We have equity advantage. It's just a standard thing right it's important to know like how i don't need to know a number but is do we have a major major advantage or just a small one uh what is it about not advantage right now um since we are not talking very general today but just about acyboards i can go a little more into detail and this is like one thing I focus on is obviously who has which sets so you can already see ace five four maybe from under the gun against the big blind we might be a little in trouble if we don't open raise fives and fours right some of us maybe even playing full ring that's not in the ranges if we up GTO Wizard, it's not really in the under the gun ranges. Lots of us anyways open raise pocket pairs with some, yeah, excuses because of post club edge and whatever. This is something important to know, right? While something like Ace-King-Deuce, Button versus Big Blind, we have all the sets Big Blind only has deuces. Next thing is two pairs, but not only two pairs, but offsuit two pairs. So, Ace-King-Deuce seems very, very pretty. So, we have all Ace-Kings, and Big Blind is more like, whatever position is probably three-betting quite some. So, Button versus Big Blind, Ace-King-Deuce is a very beautiful board. That may be interesting. Let's go back to the ace five four. Did we open race the sizing where people defend ace five and ace four offsuit? What is the specific player type? Is he tight? Is he a knit? Or is he pretty loose? Does he have hands like that? We need to go spot by spot. And understand that. This is something where I write down. This is facts. This is range versus range. We could put it into something, into solver, into equilab, whatever, and we get an answer. Who has more nuts right now? This is basically versus big blind. Most of the pots, since we're in position, it's versus big blind. I mean, they could be a small blind, but I didn't include a single example with the small blind flatting range to be honest but With what we learned today You can make up your mind and play against the small blind as well So maybe I don't expect that we have time actually, I think I planned way too much for the time we have Um, but if and there's a very tiny chance, then we actually can look up the small minus wall. Right, the second thing is tough because it's not, you don't see it in the solvers. You see it in the outputs of the solvers because they calculate everything, but it's not showing it to you anywhere. This is not advantage over time, which is just like, yeah, an evaluation that you need to do right so it's like we are not comparing hands on the flop ever not really right like it only matters your hand strength by the river so it's important since we very rarely will be all in on the flop to think about what's happening next what's happening next who is in charge then who makes the beautiful nut hands and if we look at something like ace king deuce we barrel we barrel again and then maybe river is a queen jack at 10 new straights maybe straights that only we have because villain folded those hands already on the way depending on sizings and strategies um and whether there is a nine an eight a seven a six a five like does not really A 5, 4, 3 obviously might give the big blind some wheels, but then we are only talking about suited hands. They don't matter too much when it comes to frequencies. So let's plan ahead a little. Will there be nice runouts for us or bad runouts? This tells you a lot. And now the other example I'm using right now is 5, 4, a 3, a deuce, a 4, a 5, 6, 7, 8. We hate all those cards because big blind will improve big time and we will have board coverage problems. So we know already on the flop, whatever happens next, if it's not a Broadway card, it will kind of suck. A 9 is okay that's it so we can plan ahead not advantage over time how are how much are we willing to create a big pot like creating a big pot now to then lose it later i don't know all right and then positional advantage obviously the headline here is playing in position so i'm not only talking about that i'm talking about the specific position that we are having. Playing something button versus big blind is very, very different to playing under the gun versus big blind. Just think about off-suit hands, you open race. Under the gun you might have like ace-10, ace-jack, ace-queen, ace-king, and you have all suited aces. Like king-highs, queen-highs king jack probably high frequency king 10 is already like very ambitious from under the gun queen jack for the queen high sorry ah it's just like you should know that you either have a pair or you just always have a freaking ace um so a top pair right king high boards and queen high boards for that reason are very very different because obviously all the ace-axe miss. So this is something while when you come from the button you have all the 10-9 offsuits, all the 10-8 offsuits, all the 9-8 offsuits, like way more shit, right? So it's like from under the gun on those boards your advantage will be way way way bigger and this is something we will see in the strategy all right so now to split those boards up is i want you to look for differences that have gameplay implications and not just the static board textures but this way i can already see that something like ace queen deuce button versus big, should be fairly close to Ace-King-Deuce when we come from the cutoff. Or maybe even hijack. Just thinking about which offsuit hands is Villain 3-betting from the Big Blind. Big Blind versus Button, he's 3-betting all Ace-Queens. Big Blind versus cutoff, pretty much none of them, maybe just a few. Against cutoff we start not three betting all our ace kings. Against hijack we shouldn't three bet them too often actually. So something like this. More thinking about the sets that are there, the two pairs that are there, the ace-7-7 example. Which type of trips do both players have? that's more important right Where I would call those, for example, ace-5-4 and now I would need to add positions. Under the gun versus big blind, let's take that. It's like we have clear equity advantage coming from under the gun. We have not disadvantage over time, so we will get in trouble later on. We have not advantage right now. No, not really it's like kind of even I would say maybe even a slight disadvantage when it when it comes to to the sets. Ace-King is not nuts for me in that spot for 100 big blinds. Positional advantage yeah I mean I gave you the exact position so I already put that in there and this is something how I would describe a board like that. Alright so something like ace-eight-six for example with a flush draw but versus big blind it's okay like ace-nine-seven would be better so I'm thinking about regarding the nut advantage over time like what about my offsuit hands always focusing on offsuit hands I do have something like ten-. I'm not opening 9-7 offsuit. So I have some troubles with cards, but it's not like that all of them are killing me. Like a 7 is not necessarily a bad card for me as the open raiser if I have all 10-9 offsuits. Cutoff versus big blind, ace-8-6 would be way worse, for example. All right, so just giving you some ideas how I try to divide them a little in my mind. And I will always look a little at the chat before continuing. Explanable want to range bet small GTO makes sense to bet big or check ace with... Now think about that, right? Dodako, I don't know whether you refer to a certain spot like ace-5-4. If you refer to the ace-5-4 under the Gunversus Big Blind specifically, I just give you a tick. It's like, all right, you're right. I think in most games, if you're talking about ace high boards in general, this will be very, very wrong because you have some stuff happening that we do not necessarily want to happen. Ace-King, ace-Queen-Axe, ace-Checkups. No, I would say no. I think exploitatively you want to do something very different. All right, so we'll get to that. Will this stream be uploaded a little later? It will be definitely for the members on the platform. I'm not sure whether we make a YouTube video out of it. Probably, probably they stay a little, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe there is someone of the moderators here that that knows better than I do How SPR impacts the nut advantage over time deeper more shallow less Yeah, it depends as like a deepness starts preflop right if they are super deep Then they shouldn't probably three bet all the ace Kings and so on so What counts as nuts in my eyes always always depends on the stack death right for 20 big blinds every top pair is the nuts um but we had a special two coachings the last ones about different stack sizes part one part two i think i talked a lot about uh it there uh it's all on the platform so this is for poco code members only but this is too too much for that coaching um all right cool let's go to the next one where is our advantage Thanks for watching! This is for PocoCode members only, but this is too much for that coaching. All right, cool. Let's go to the next one. Where is our advantage? Advantage doesn't mean that we need to capture it now. And this is now coming to something that Dodak possesses actually that fits perfectly. He wants to see that small on ace-king-axe, ace-queen-axe, ace-jack-axe as an exploit against weaker players. Thus, and I want to invite you to give me your answer, like why do I think this is shit? Why do I think this is shit? Obviously you bet all the hands and they fold very often. But question that. Is that a big success? Diacu says delay game tree is is cool with advantage too, saying that we could exploit even more there. Okay. Geduldbitte says, because with strong hands, we need to build a bigger pot when they hit us well a little something. Yes. Right, so now we think about maybe, Hiacu's maybe talking more about the delayed game tree or like thinner value and so on. Let's start with our nuts, right? So, I'll have all of those walnuts again. So Geduldbitte, or patience So, I'll have all of those walnuts again. So, Geduld bitte, or patience please, I like to call him. He says, yeah, we need to extract more value with our nut heads, right? We have that problem that something like ace king is the absolute nuts right now, but it won't stay nuts. If we bet small now, turn is a queen, jack or 10, where villain proves to 12 offsuit combos of straights, we we can extract a very very different amount of value. We cap the SPR very very high and yeah it will be tough it will be easier for villain to fold easy ace-axe we can't go crazy crazy because well they are protected with quite some straights so we cannot just like go directional and after betting, maybe even forcing them to fold some of the queen-jack, queen-10, that would be different. And the other thing now, talking about weaker hands, is maybe the delayed game tree is cool, but I'm looking for some more reasons. Tango Turtle, here we go. No, because we fold out little equity. It's important What are we folding out? It always feels like a success to win a hand to make villain fold But let's say with ace king loose rainbow and villain folds 9-6 suited without backdoor This is not a success. He only has chance to lose money to us That's like why not check back your king queen your pocket Queens and let him do something or let's check back a reasonable range Let's say right your aces for example, right? It's very very tough for especially for weaker players To play their bullshit correctly They either are not doing anything You can just have the cheapest bluffs of all times on delayed streets while not investing anything in their okayish hands that they bet on the turn themselves or they just take the wrong bluffs and so they just play wrong all right geometric higher EV in theory for the nuts if it's a static board that's a little with the theory but in this specific spot yes they will likely call hands versus big but that should be folding because their range is too weak. This is now a little next level. Are people doing that? I don't know. Ace-King-X blind versus blind, like splitting between min and like 3x pot, right? That's a special one, blind versus blind, out of position. Yes, here we are in position. That's another big advantage. Yeah, people are misplaying the probe. Guddubide says it again. On AceKingX, he's talking about how villains should play the probe in GameTree. And there's lots of 200% plus bets involved. No small bets. And if you think about what are people doing, it's very, very different to that. Okay, let's keep it for that right now. So advantage does not mean that we need to capture it now. What next up? What is the decided pot size for certain hands we are having? This is not something that is important I don't ace King deuce if we talk about the flop The decided pot size for ace King is all the money in the middle Clearly for ace Queen right now actually as well turn and river will change things because villain adds two pairs But right now ace-queen is nuts like villain has pocket deuces And ace-deuce that's it. Like we just have him crushed. He has ace-jack, ace-ten, ace-nine and so on So the question now for us is how do we get there? And this always goes a question hand in hand with a with a question like How much is villain helping? If he's not raising which he he's very, very likely not doing on ace-king-deuce, especially weaker players, then we need to do the job ourselves. We need to get the money in the middle if there is a goal of getting all the money in the middle. If the goal is only putting two streets in the middle, it's a different world. Because then, every single time check is also valid. So we will see something like ace-5-4. Think about that. Under the gun versus big blind, ace-5-4. I'm asking you that. Under the gun versus big blind, how many bets do you want to get in the middle? Let's say the pot right now is five big blinds. What is your dream pot in the end? I want to have a big blind amount, right? Five big blinds right now. So for example, maybe you wanna put out a small bet now of 1.5 big blinds, then the pot would be eight if Willem calls, and then on the turn you put out a bigger bet, like six big blinds, Willem calls, then the pot is 20 big blinds, and then you check back your river, like on most run outs, probably. Maybe a thin third barrel. But you can tell me what is your goal of reaching a certain pot size? There. Ace-king on ace-5-4 under the gun versus big blind. Is it this 20 big blinds I just described? Is it 30 big blinds? Is it 100 big blinds? Is it all in 200 big blinds? Tango turtle goes a little bigger than me on the flop or on the turn so ends up with with 25. Someone else? We got 140 players in here. No players? Viewers? Whatever. Just give me some numbers. There's no wrong. No right or wrong. This is a feeling-based question. Against weaker plays, bet until he raises for ace-king on ace-5-4. Okay, yeah, that's a good point. 20 BB, 25, 30 to 40. Depends on who we play against. If you play an unknown, an pool let's let's take let's take this level for for now 20 25 soon pool on poker stars guy is sitting with hundred big blinds you have never seen before from Latvia I'm just in the question is ace 5 for rainbow we play under the gun versus big blind we start with the pot of five big blinds what is your desired pot size in the end? A random question. No right or wrong. So far we have everything between my 20, that was a random example, and 40. So now guessing how do we get there. And not bigger than 20 bigs. So we put in a small bet and then a 3 quarters bet. See right, one. Where now I just want to showcase that minimum defense frequency is nothing that we are interested in right now. But just showing that with a certain bet size we force villain to defend a certain portion of his hands. On certain boards he needs to clearly overfold but this is usually only the case when he has a clear disadvantage which he doesn't have on ace-5-4. So those numbers are not too far out of this world, so far disregarding raising ranges and so on. So it's a very very very big simplification. But I just gave you certain bet sizes, bet 25, bet 75, bet 125, bet 150, and this is what Willen, that we don't have like immediate profit, the portion of his range he needs to defend, right? From 80% down to 40%. We are shaping villain's range. Yes, he can raise and so on as well. I'm focusing on the calls here. It's a big simplification. And now we can take different lines. And obviously, you can combine minimum defense frequency to get like an overall minimum defense frequency here. And we see already that there are different ways, right? For example, I could bet small on the flop, overbet the turn, and this is like kind of the the forced range that Villa needs to defend, like 32 percent. Or I could check back, play a delayed game tree of betting 75 and betting 75 again, and get to almost the same. Maybe that line when I decide to overbet thebet the river it's a little different obviously or i just overbet flop over bad turn again okay then villain can defend a little tighter so what i just quickly want to show with that is different plans can reach to the same goal we want to create a certain pot size and we want to play against a certain part of villain's range um And there are different ways, like this is obviously meaning that the pot size is kind of the same as well. And now we should figure out, right, I just wanted to outline here that it's not necessary that we bet the flop if our goal is something that is less than a certain number. So only those hands that really want to go directionall in absolutely need to bet the flop, with some exceptions. Maybe the top set blocking everything has still more EV than something else. But yeah, the ace-king on ace-king-do is just absolutely freaking needs to bet. If we check that, this is giving up lots of EV. So here, this is just something I want to show here, because people love betting in spots where it's not necessarily true so um just a very very quick example now let's let's say let's ask again a question we are still working on ace five four be honest with yourself how often do you see that under the gun versus big blind ace king on ace 5-4 rainbow? I'm honest. I see that a hundred percent Give me your number. What is your honest answer? That will obviously show you now The theory answer we can see ace king was exactly what we were talking about And it's about 50-50 now we see 100 100 100 luke plays a cool 30 100 100 and so on right so 85 90 i think we have lots of hundreds for the fact that actually this hand um should strategy plus just strategy that's the right one should check 55 58 depending on the suits there is only a 34 57 so um yeah the ones with club like bet like betting a little more um with the king of clubs but okay all right so let's say ace of hearts king of spades the one on the top left is our it's our hand to go with freaking 56 check Why are we playing so differently? Do we really have a clear opinion that we make more money like that? Let's be honest, betting, getting check raised, and folding is the absolute right play, even against the perfect player. So if we do that, like okay, against the fish thatraise value is like, okay, cool. I don't know. It's just like our favorite game tree. Like, because it's the easiest one. I think we can extract more value even against weaker players in a different way. And obviously, this way we know exactly and so on that like, okay, they check-raise their sets and nothing else. If they call, we have a better hand and so on keep going from there um but yeah so it's just something to think about i want you guys to think for yourself okay all right so um yeah that was the first quick example and uh the question is that how do we get there right i talked about different different ways, right? I could maybe for all those that have seen my racetrack Racetrack session, right? I think a little like that that we have like a starting line where we start starting pot size Here's like the all-in pot size and we get there for example ace-king-do. So let's take that example again With three big streets that bad bad all-in right green would be the villain here I'm going to go ahead would be the villain here. He doesn't have an arrow because he's not freaking helping, right? So now we don't plan to get directional in, and this is why I asked you, I want you to think about where is your goal. Is it here, like building a 20-big blind pot in that area? Let's say this here is like a goal line, right? Is it here somewhere? Is it somewhere here in the middle? Say this is 50 big blinds, like this little exponential diagram here, here would be 100 big blinds. But yeah, whatever, right? And then we could do, what could we do, right? Let's say, okay, we could do a check flop. This stands for a check. Then we bet small on the turn and then we bet big on the river. Or we small on the flop check on the turn call a big river bet let's say a river villain finally bets and once he bets bigger than that line actually we are bluff catching right he over bets river uh we can we could take a look into that right or it's just we check back villain bets twice or uh we bet once villain checks, it's red again here. We see bet. We check back turn. Willem didn't do a shit and we bet river again. And again, we have different ways to reach that goal. All right. Right. Yes, I'm absolutely in trouble. This is the one exploit that people are doing for this. It is the main reason that people are not check raising enough. And the good thing is they're not folding. Instead, they are calling. So putting more money in in a way where they end up losing a lot all right cool so now making use of our advantage this is now what we are all here for right um and my main point here and this is very very similar to lots of coaching sessions I gave already, because it's always the same. Sorry, my throat kills me. And like freaking drinking tea all day long still. Okay, so I want you to understand incentivization. We have two options and obviously all the trade-offs in between. We can either bet big, obviously talk about where does big start and how big can we go, but the big bets are mainly designed to charge the villain. He has certain hands that want to continue, we charge them. If we want to charge just a gutshot, it's maybe not as big as something where we want to make gutshot indifferent, not as big as trying to target a flush draw draw already which is almost impossible on the flop right we're just jamming in position there or we use smaller bets to deny equity of weekends before someone said okay we see that small ace king deuce so villain folds pocket sixes and he would only invest money when he hits a six on the term so that's like four percent that he hits the six and this is the equity denial that we have because then he can go big big big and so on um or yes this is the big upside if he folds pocket sixes which he probably shouldn't against a small bet exactly for that reason because he has not equity then this is a great great reason to bet small um but i want to see it way more in that way that I just... I'm in the driver's seat. I'm choosing the hands that I want to play against. I can either say, okay, on ace-king-deuce, I want to just play against all his ace-axe, maybe the king-axe with the backdoor flush draw and all his gut shots. I want to play against those. That's cool. I have a good hand. I want to crush those. So I bet big and only play against those. Or actually, I have a hand that prefers to play against his 10-9, 10-8, 9-7, 9-8, 6-7, 4-6 suited, deuce-axe, a weak king, something like that. Pocket sixes, five sevens are in there as well, obviously. So I want to show that quickly is that uh that we just what i like doing is not looking at my c-bet strategy let's take this ace king do's example we raise the button big blind calls we get ace king deuce actually i prefer the well whatever um asking deuce we see already what the strategy should be in the solver the The small bet just does not exist. A normal medium trade-off bet doesn't exist. A normal bigger bet does not exist. And we play a really big bet. I think actually 125 is not perfect. Something like slightly bigger should be more linear. And I think even slightly bigger than that would be better if we put it in PIO. But whatever. Let's not be too picky here. And we see clearly what I do here as well is looking at which hands clearly want to do one thing. And these are exactly the hands we talked about already. Those that hate seeing those turn cards without getting enough of the value before. Pocket Kings. Ace King. Ace King. Ace Queen. Ace Jack. ace jack pocket deuces deuce x for the blocker reasons just have like super ev here with a big bet but that's it those are the hands that absolutely need to do that everything else is indifferent where they don't give a shit what they do time will tell right so no better players play close to optimal. Right, but we need a reason to deviate. If this year is the standard, well why is everyone deviating? No one is playing like that. So I think because most people still think that the small bet, high with ace-high board and so on is correct. On high stakes people play differently. So, and I told you the reason right every time I face a small bet I'm happy I say I say thank you I call sometimes it turns a queen jack ten and I know my life out of position just got way easier. All right and every time think about playing against a weak player right now getting to what I actually wanted to tell us that i look at villains folding ranges if you think about betting small this year is what's happening um you might argue that villain is not check raising enough okay cool he's not check raising ace jack which is a mix whatever and he's maybe missing the bluffs okay but he's playing 34.5 office range absolutely perfect this is more my point he's maybe missing the bluffs. Okay. But he's playing 34.5% off his range. Absolutely perfect. This is more my point. He's playing 8-6 suited perfect. He will fold. Every idiot will fold. Will fold. Will fold. Will fold. Will fold. Will fold. Why not giving him the option to see a random turn card and force him to play all this shit? He will mess up. Let's take a random turn card. A more random than the jack one like a 6 after sorry after check check turn is a 6 whatever put out a flush draw this is what they should be playing I'm saying they probably better like a 7 like half pot telling you their hand strength ace jack-Jack, they are betting every single time. Like, all this air, they are not checking. They are not bluffing, they are just checking all the time. Maybe they bet all their flush draws. Like, there's so much to mess up. Taking the wrong sizing, taking the wrong frequency, not bluffing, always bluffing, and so on. So, that's it, right? Okay. Just, I want to give you that idea here and why it makes sense. So here we have clearly the incentivization to bet big and the incentivization to bet small is not really there. We can look that up here and need to understand like this here just shows the green line is the button's hand. And there's a line line for like from weakest hands to strongest hands and we see the equity those hands have against full range full range of the Big blind same the blue line for the big blind the weakest hands he's having is having like 15% 16% to 6 4 of clubs against our entire range. Obviously we are not checking back our entire range. We are checking more back a range that is prepared to play shit like that. And we just keep that in. It's like not that this is outdrawing us on the turn ever. It's not that it's drawing to a freaking third pair that's not worth anything. It would be different on ace-3-deuce. On ace-3-deuce it's a big success to fold out seven eight so betting frequency should be higher there anyways even though we have less of an advantage okay so now we see this what are we making indifferent what is the tough life we give villain and here by betting small on a board like this we give his suited queen with a backdoor flush draw a tough life and that's it like nothing nothing is having a tough life easy fold or easy call if you do something like this here and now we can talk about exploits and adaption his gut shots are indifferent his king x is a fold or indifferent his ace x we can look at the ev it's like not indifferent but has a value of 0.6 we're talking about His ace-axe, we can look at the EV, is like not indifferent but has a value of 0.6. We're talking about 5.5 plus 6.9 in the middle, so 12 big blinds in the middle. So there is not really, like he hates his life having flop top here. And I think there's way more room to actually mess up. Just like calling king 10, king 9, king 8 is massive blunder here. All right. Yeah, I mean I think you're both saying the same thing here too. I don't know. I don't want to fight into that argument. So I agree with number one, what would be right is what we want to know first. We need a baseline. Number two, what is villain doing wrong? And I want to have an answer for that. If you give me an answer, what villain is doing wrong, we can talk about all the exploits in the world, which is what we do at the table in the end, actually. But we started with our baseline, and therefore it's great to know what is correct in theory. All right. So again, I'm way behind time, obviously, as always. But yeah, GTO wizard examples. I think this one is good enough. Maybe another one. I talked about ACE3-DEUCE, where we see... So here we had a clear example for the big size. And let's have a look at this one here, where... Oh, we're not seeing any big size. Because what would a big size hurt? Nothing, right? Villain sits there, always focused on offsuit hands. He either has an ace or he is freaking full of shit. Those offsuit hands do not connect with that at all, right? Offsuit hands make frequencies and suited hands are kind of jokers. um but something like that we said before right folding out jack nine is a massive success because if villain turns that jack it's actually an okay hand remember again ace king deuce if he returns jack there it's not really worth anything and probably has to fold to the first biggish bet being a random bluff catcher here it's a hand turning a second pair that actually has some value that's so here let's have a look against that small bet yeah we give him quite some trouble we force him to clearly over fold that board sit there with his king highs makes elections all this with the backdoor flush draws just like it sucks right obviously his ace has a very different type of value now on that board like that against a small bet and then we probably start polarizing on the turn well we get rid of the shit we can talk about the plan turns the king of clubs check boom hallelujah right so easy 250 with ace queen and ace jack kind of now we see like okay now shifting back from ace three deuce strategy to ace king deuce. Actually, oh, we got a king now. Let's go. And yeah, so that works pretty well. So keeping in mind our incentivization, we are shaping villain's range. We want to really build like something, shape his range, to then evaluate that on the turn. And then maybe we polarize on the flop already. Or we often polarize on the turn and just first fold out some certain hands. And therefore, I love those two words, charging and it's denying equity. With a clear plan that you, one time you focus on the folds that you get, the other time you focus on the potential calls you are getting. I'm charging his gut shots. We've seen that his gut shots on ace-king-deuce were exactly indifferent. So we're charging them or he's falling, that's fine. Then it's denying equity as well. But Jack Nye, like we were, I'm giving a shit what he does. Hiachu, okay. I have trouble playing against villains who doesn't follow the incentive of the rangers. Say we have ace-queen on ace-king-deuce. Well, ace-queen on the flop is pretty much nuts. Then you can just rip it or it's never happening because he only does it with deuces, but then it's just not happening. It's just like... Let's have a look quickly, right? I think this is something that lots of us struggle with. But what if, right? Don't be scared of it. If we overbet and he check raises, he either does it with deuces and then we end up having a 1.5 check raising range and you shouldn't just, don't bother, don't bother. Don't worry about it. Or if he does that more often, our ace queen is just nuts. There's no way he has better hands. Obviously, we need to evaluate those boards differently against super nits who are not even 3-betting ace-king. All the reason here why we go so crazy is Willem not having ace-king and barely having ace-queen. That's our reason for going big. If that is wrong, we need to adjust. Okay, I need to keep going, little guys. Oh, this is already an example. I'm fine. All right, then, TJ Will, one more example. I thought there's one slide in between let's or actually I ask you can you tell me a board where there's a mix a mix of things mix of incentives now I have shown you a board where we only are incentivized to bet small and I've shown you board where we were only incentivized to bet big can you give me a board where there is a mix where we see the problem having two incentives? ace-jack-10 Slick a ladder, that's great. But we are only talking about ace high boards today a flush draw So let's say the flush draw on something like an ace three deuce board Always gives us more to charge but yeah, it's not really changing. It's not changing things let's have a quick look because this is very good point and this is why i'm not really including flush draw boards so far because everything stays the same this is ace 3 deuce rainbow uh remember that we we remember now everything everyone remembers that 30 30 and like 10 let's remember that um and none of the bigger. Let's add a flush draw and see how things are differently. 27 and nine, and 4% of the bigger size. This is just showing you that there's more reason to bet a little bigger, but that's about it. But actually there's some reason to bet smaller as well. But now the first reason is, if we look at that, we're targeting one fourth of the suited part. This is not many combinations. Obviously we always run into flush draws when people continue and so on, but this is our target zone here. Offsuit combinations. This is our freaking target zone. And now this is why we could go even smaller because Willem can navigate. His offsuit combos are no different. It's different whether he has the king 10 with the king of hearts Right, it's just a stronger hand But if what we want to follow us the king 10 without hearts that we he would fall to even a smaller bench But if we go 1.8, there is no smaller bet than that but king 10 offsuit without hearts It's just a very clear fold. so that just shows us we could go even smaller and have the same result um so this is why i prefer like 25 and like even smaller on some boards like that let's see we got an ace jack 10 ace king queen let's have a look let's take the ace jack 10 uh i work with the rainbow boards and then shift from that 1.8 because it's so good we can we can range bet if we want yes this is a different reasoning here because it's just the range but we can just invest money with all our hands because our advantage is so massive this is something we see more from under the gun uh let's just prove that hopefully ace jack 10 because we just know we always have something i hope i don't mess up here. So this is just, we can bet everything because our advantage is so gigantic, so enormous. It's not necessarily the incentive of denying equity, because denying equity on ace, jack, 10, what, like villainous floating against a small bet with king high and queen high and everything else is bullshit. So that's not really the point. It's more that our advantage is so so so so so big that everything is just incentivized to say like we're so freaking flying let's build a pot sir. Right? This is kind of a different reason. Ace-7-5. Let's have a look. I go back to the button. button big blind ace seven five not really a big bad board again off suit hands we need to find something that that those guys hit here because a seven five no sorry no reason to bet big so we change the next word I like it patient please goes with ace ten five we have those offsuit gut shots and we have good reason to fold out something like a jack 9 jack 8 a queen 9 like some backdoors just a king 9 as a king high that is worth a little something drawing to a second pair um something like that right so let's see what we what we target with 6.9 we target again 10x and the gut shots we target um something like that right so let's see what we what we um target with 6.9 we target again 10x and the gut shots we target some offsuit hands so the strategy is good easy as easy as that we bet small we target some certain hands that are actually again we see smaller would be better in that case because they are not indifferent. We want them, yeah, actually smaller would be better. We are not really targeting a certain hand. That just shows me that 33% is the wrong sizing. There's not a single hand that is hating life. King-9 with backdoor flush draw, but we want to focus on offsuit. So I would prefer 20% instead. But there is the incentivization, and the solver shows that, and I'm 100% sure that it would go even smaller if it was offered. A mix of incentives. Cool. All right. So this is really something to keep in mind. Understand incentivization. Bigger bets to charge villain, smaller bets to deny equity. You can even do that against bad players. Big bet your value hands that exactly need it and small bet all your shit. That's fine. Alright. This is a wild sentence but it's absolutely true. But I'm not reading it loud like. For Mixed Sense, how do we choose which part of the range to play against? Look at your hand chew do you want to fold out queen nine if you have king queen probably not this is why king queen is pretty much never betting small sometimes some frequency in there for balance reasons to never not have king like straights on the jack turn but it's not really incentivized to do that when we have something like eight nine you see this is a higher frequency small betting hand um yes we fall out king nine queen nine so often we go like the domination domination uh problem here right i make a different spot here for that um what is incentivized to bet small we have a look at this here and I call it the offsuit triangle. So I make that like that on the go. And everyone's happy that I can open up paint, hopefully. So what I call where is a triangle here? This is the offsuit triangle that I'm focused on. I keep the aces out because they are top pairs This year and I should have started somewhere else. So it's more like here this these are all the opposite hands that are not an ace That well, this is now our range right and you can see that actually for all unpaired hands the frequencies start on the bottom right and Usually go to the top left. They're usually higher on the bottom right and very low on the top left. Sometimes it's slightly different. Right here, the king-queen is so strong that this starts to be a value bet because it gets called by weaker king-x. Queen-10, jack-10 here just a little because they have a nice effect. Plus, they have a backdoor straight. This is what makes them stronger than makes them stronger than queen nine jack nine but if we compare spots like that just in general and like all the spots we know what we start betting it usually is like that and the very easy explanation is the following if we look at villains range right if we have eight nine it's very important to us that he folds 10 nine jack nine queen nine king nine and 10. These are all potential small coolers. If we don't bet, it goes check-check, turn is a 9. We have the potential small cooler where one bet goes into the middle against us. If we see that small turn is a 9, we know that if villain didn't have an ace, okay, that's the one problem, then we probably have the best hand now. And same thing the other way around. If we have king-queen or a king-jack or king-ten here, well, if we turn a pair and villain as well, then we definitely have the cooler on our side. Because we kept in king-nine, queen-nine. So this hopefully answers the question uh how do we know what we are incentivized to play against all the supertans do not matter too much this is an equity thing that more equity is usually better to bet right so here we see like where is it hearts diamonds and spades will prefer betting over clubs that's easy right but everything here is preparing the certain delayed game tree and the normal game tree and so on. All right. Cool. A very good question. I hope that... Everything here is preparing the certain delayed game tree and the normal game tree and so on. All right. Cool. A very good question. I hope that that explains things a little. Yeah, anything else I want to explain? No. And for the nuts, that's very important as well. The strong hands, it's often like, can they get killed? Or blockers, right? we see deuces and threes betting all the time here or let's go back to our ace 10 4 ace 10 5 or what it was uh to see okay aces want to bet small to keep everything in and to get bluff check raises in right because if we bet big we mainly target ace x as well or this is where our value comes from but we know that villain doesn't have a sex right so why should we bet big with aces and then villain falls to 10 that's the worst thing that could happen to us obviously right well pocket tens actually it's fun that they bet small as well um i'm not 100 understanding that uh they seem to still get try to get value from 10 i i actually they unblock the five that that check raises often. That's maybe the point. But 5s are the clear one that want to go big or prefer that. Actually, Ace-King, I could ask you the question now again. How big do you want your pot to be? It's probably not three streets on most runouts. This is what we see here because we see quite some checking frequency. And actually, I don't remember the last time I checked back Ace-King button versus big blind on Ace-10-5. Never in my life if I didn't time out, to be honest. How do you play versus stomp on Ace-King-X button versus big blind? Do we split race sizing or only geo sizing? Okay, this is something that shouldn't happen, so I'm not really thinking about it. If this this is happening I know villain is a big fish like a really really big fish and it means something so I have specific reads if it means he has something then I'm just folding when I don't have anything and when I beat him like often this is half potbongs can be like ace eight or something like that just pieces of the board then I'm going directional in I want to go for the maximum or i have that read that he folds that on the way that i take everything usually the first time i spot it i erase all the time like just because you can't have anything okay i wish we would have time for turnballs there is some great videos on the poco code platform where i talk about turn barrels on all those spots um but yeah okay Okay, cool. Let's go to some examples. We have five minutes left, okay? But this is our first example. I will tell you not the solver strategy, but my personal strategy, because this is the next point. We don't need to follow that blindly. You can play that with small bet only. Giving up small, small, small EVs, small, small differences. For me, it's important that you understand you understand incentives why that is the case if you play correctly on turn and river with an easier strategy it's way better for you so you can play big only in check or you can play small bet with almost full range both is fine you need to know the implications for the turn what you did you shaped villains range you need to know what you shaped it to. So this is important. So here on ace-10-5, I'm not playing those two sizes. I'm not playing, but this is not the one. I'm asking you ace-jack-9 with two hearts. You can guess how I'm playing, or you can just tell me how you are playing. Butt versus big blind, ace-jack-9 with two hearts. Patience, please, goes for a normal big bet. Bet 75, big, with big with ace king off i need a plan for my like what i do usually with my entire range i break down my options to pretty much two maximum three which means a check and one bet size or check and mad really not here i use one bad size here um and two bad sizes like we have seen on ace ten five so So yeah, just tell me what you do not with your hand just the options that you're giving yourself I hope you're not playing ten different sizes check or bet 75 Check or bet 75 about 30% of my range big and check a lot Poker code official whoever that is cool. It's a small size. We like everything in. Okay, so now let's talk about in scope ones back. Are we denying equity? Yes, a small size denies equity of what? Which offsuit hands can we deny equity from? Which offsuit hand is villain folding against a small size? I don't find any. Low ones. Yeah, okay. Like if he defends 6-7 offsuit, but 7-8 has a gut shot. Maybe that folds. 10-8 offsuit is calling. A 9 is calling. A jack is calling. Everything with the queen. Offsuit should be queen 9, queen 10, queen jack is calling. Every king is calling. I mean, maybe not king 8, right? So really, I don't see the point in betting small against offsuit combos here. I'm way more on bigger bets to charge villain. Make use of nut advantage. We have nines, we have jacks, we have aces. Jack, ace, nine, yeah, he has as well. But he has aces, never. Jacks, never. Nines, low frequency. Ace, jack, not always. Ace, jack suited, never. Okay. So it's a clear advantage. He has king, queen offsuit. King, tenten offsuit, jack-x, king-jack and so on and all the weak aces obviously. So I play like this. My strategy, this is a lot already. My strategy plan is I polarize, I play a little like ace-king-deuce, I bet pot or I check. Let's have a look, don't forget the rest for now. We have a quick look of the solvers playing. A pretty clear preference for even the overbet and some 75 right so this is something i've actually seen and decided i mix those and put it together like this i play those as one range which is pot bet and we clearly see how much that is light for jacks for ace king for ace queen for ace jack and so on because again small bet what do we make a difference okay you fold out villains pocket pairs cool and suited kings again let's have a look at the offsuit triangle no effect whatsoever turn is a 10 your jacks are not nuts anymore turn is a queen your jacks are not nuts anymore turn is a king your jacks are not nuts anymore turn is an eight your jack are not nuts anymore turn is a Seven, you got it, right? Your jacks are not nuts anymore turn is an eight your jack are not nuts anymore turns seven you got it right your jacks are not nuts anymore um so you can't go wild with those anymore you can't bet now and then crazy over bad turn no you missed value that's the point right so this year let's take this i take the one in between villain calls then there's a 10 it doesn't hurt you that much you've fallen out lots of king queen already um that's cool and so on right so um this is right so now attack villains one pair hands to the maximum as well as all his weak draws this is my plan here but i know i'm charging i shouldn't here i should call it charge all right cool and now this is now how i build my ranges i want to know my cornerstones there's lots of mixes right everything that is not a mix is my cornerstone kind of what i do with ace eight i don't give a shit i don't need to know what i do with kings okay this might be a cornerstone this is important that we check it and don't pot it very very easy right so here important must value this is where i make my money again show that I tell it every coaching for like the last six months. I fell in love with the absolute values of the hands because this shows us what is important. Something like how we play 6-4 of spades that has an EV of 1.1 in this hand is interesting, but not that interesting. We talk about nines that have like an EV of like 11.8 big blinds or jacks of 12.2 or aces. This is important. Ace king. So here the cornerstones are those hands must value. They need to pot bet. Everything else is bullsh!t. And the bluffs that we need because they are certainly good for certain properties they have is here actually the nine of spades is an important one because these are the nine X villain continues So we cover the nine eggs on the turn as well make beautiful two pairs We need to cover all the gut shots that we turn all the straights ourselves Deuces to fives are cool because it's high frequency, but not not must but it's like yeah turning a turning a deuce, 3, 4, 5 is pretty cool. And then obviously to cover both the flush draw and the backdoor flush draw, best case, the high ones. Low ones can't turn either, but are more of a mix. Cornerstones, checking range. What are we absolutely checking is kings, queens, ace, eight, minus, especially those without the ace of hearts,ens, eights, sevens, they just have no point in betting. Jack, X mainly. Again here, I put the same in because it's important to cover those cards as well. We need to make straights on a king. We need to make straights on a queen, on a ten, on an eight, on a seven. So we need to mix those. And the nut blows need to belong in there. All right, important mixes that we have some strong hands when checking back is aces. Actually, jack-9, that is very very rarely a three-street hand. We can plan ahead already. Often we only want to get two streets in. If the turn is a ten of hearts, we are happy that we didn't invest money on the flop. And yeah, the gut shots that I already mentioned here. Alright, cool. What makes something an important mix is mainly the value of the hand itself, that we shouldn't forget it. If we check back here and never have a strong hand, Willem has a big advantage on a deuce or a three, something like that, so we should know, okay, we still have those strong hands, even on those bricks, right? This board changes a lot on certain runouts, like turns a ten or a heart or a queen or an eight or a seven, lots of hands. Give us new nuts. We always want to be a little nut protected. Lots of turn cards Thank you. a lot on certain runouts like turns a 10 or a heart or a queen or an eight or seven lots of hands give us new nuts we always want to be a little not protected lots of turn cards will give us new nuts but some not and this is what we need to know or that we just need to know okay we need to cover those cards because villain improves big time with all his offsuit combinations we should not be helpless that villain knows oh we are never checking back an open ender sure it's absolutely fine to check back queen of clubs ten of diamonds why not why should that be so beautiful to bet it's like whatever right it has value in both both parts of the game tree all right cool um we're two minutes over the time but i want to give you one more example. Again, same game. You tell me your strategy. Ace, king, jack. Cutoff versus big blind. Finally, something else. We talked a lot. Ace, five, four under the gun. We talked now button versus big blind a lot. Cutoff versus big blind. Ace, king, jack. What is your strategy? And thanks for the warm words, Sunsmith. Happy that you learned a lot. Range, c-bet. Talk about sizings as well. One big blind, bet 33, bet 66, 80% frequency, 33% sizing, I guess always. Cut off because villain has queen, 10 rarely. Big blind should defend every queen, 10 against the cut off. No No cutoff just to mix it up. 75 or jack. All right let's have a look what I'm doing and what GTO is doing. I'm range betting but with b50 because lots of hands, lots again. Think about the offsuit broadway hands. He always has a king or a queen or a jack or a 10 so b33 is not effective b33 or b25 different like my small bet is 25 gto wizard always takes 33 um is again targeting weak pockets or four or five suited i'm not too interested in that um so i size up to a sizing where i can actually range better so i prepared a little something for you here for that one i think and i ran exactly this board in piyo myself and only offered b50 so we see if i only offer that it says 90 percent bet uh not a single hand is really like checking back high frequency just our seven six of clubs so i did something else as well oh no here is it and i just forced piyo to bet every time so and what we can see here is the difference in ev 35.62 35.65 so i'm slightly over bluffing because i'm I'm always betting my 7.6 of clubs. But pretty much yeah. Whether I check back a little something protected with aces, ace jack and king. It's bullshit. That's like we can call in our world same EV. This is not the level we are in poker. If this EV is not making us a winner then we have a different problem. But it this year i have a perfect my flop strategy is set i don't need cornerstones it's beautiful don't need to plan i play it perfectly my personal strategy i can tell you i played blindly you can make wake me up anytime on this board i will play my strategy perfectly and so what do i need to do now i need to look at the turn right so I need to get prepared for the turn to plan again, right? Because here we have lots of different plans. We have obviously the ace-king, ace-king advantage, jacks, kings, aces. Where do they want to end up? Depends on the turn, right? Often going directional in. Obviously queen-10 wants to end all in. Villain has queen-10 himself. Villain has the two pairs. So we have like an advantage. Like ace-queen, where does that wants to end all in villain has queen 10 himself villain has the two pairs so we have like an advantage like ace queen where does that want to end up well but all the hands like to get money in the middle first because our advantage is so big and well we can see with villain's reaction hopefully that he hates it already right he folds already 47 against half pot so we just generate money here and he hates his life with the king already. But again, we see that offsuit part. And this is a big takeaway for you guys. Hopefully today, this is something we want to focus on. And this shows me already that I would prefer something slightly bigger than 50%. Because, I mean, there's not really something I can hurt with a gutshot plus thing. But this like jack ten has four this is now a dollar uh four dollar eb um in a 73 dollar pot so it's like in percent it's not that much um this should be you know that's half a big line that's yeah maybe slightly bigger is better but it's it's tough sometimes okay here it's really tough to focus the offset part okay so now we played flop perfectly so what we can do on those spots when we play the flop already perfectly without thinking about it we can plan ahead for the turn and I split it up before loading that file here we plan on a pier turn an ace king or Jack might be special plan on a straight turn, a queen or a ten and everything else is a brick. And this is what we see here, I just showed the strategy here, deuce to nine is a very very easy strategy. Because villain is protected we stick to b75, maybe slightly bigger but not really overbetting. If the turn is a king or an ace we actually overbet and need to pretty much polarize to straight plus because then our advantage is having ace king and villain let's say turn is an ace or a turn is a king villain has all the king X we have those as well but we have like we have the straights obviously but then we have the we have way more of the boats so we start targeting villains king and say we have a boat this is where the overbet comes from but obviously lots of checking and the queen and 10 both players have lots of straights this is why we go down to a small bet small bet to make again to leverage our set an ace king advantage let's quickly have a look here. Bill and calls, turn is the ace of diamonds. Check, we overbet, and you see only boats and queen-10, and blockers, that's about it. Or the turn is a queen, some donking, but not really. And then we still wanna value bet our queens, our kings our jacks our tens but we need to get small to force villain to continue lots of fans like against small but he's indifferent with his top pair that's kind of a success that's cool um yeah all right so this is a different way how we can create our personal game plan right so now we I want to double check it with GTO Wizard as well. I actually didn't do that before. So let's see what that one is doing. It's probably splitting in a couple of sizings and a checking range as well. So Ace, King, Jack. It's a different game plan. And I think minus EVY is very, very close. So again, you can think about about whether you bet 33 50 and 75 and split it up correctly again certain hands want to work with certain incentivization and GTO wizard is working that out perfectly as well as the 15 percent incentivization to check or you take something that has almost same EV understanding what's going on and play play range bet and play every turn perfectly. Or at least you play the plot perfectly in your strategy that might have slightly, slightly less EV, but you should regain that EV by playing the turn way better. Okay, let's have a look in the chat. What's the threshold and frequency? I'm not really looking at the frequency. It's like somewhere 80 to 85 percent, I would say. Maybe even 75. I'm more looking at specific hands. Do specific hands clearly need to check? Here, I can tell you, is there a single hand that needs to check that I'm interested in? Nope. Nope. Five, six of clubs. But that's a bullshit bluff that is the same EV with anything. Cool. Not a single hand that has any EV hates anything. Is there any hand that clearly needs to do one specific sizing? No, it's all the same shit. Whether you attack his king-ex or his jack-ex without backdoor, or the 10-ex with backdoor or without backdoor, it's in the end doesn't matter. You need to follow up correctly. This is, again, like shaping. I need something. We have tissues here. You shape his range like this, or you shape it like this or like this. You need to follow up correctly. The best way we shape five five um i'll skip this one um to not make it too long and we'll get you key takeaways okay i can show it you can you can make you can make mind. You can take a screenshot now, take it as a homework, look up what I'm doing, and then double-check GTO Wizard. So for everyone interested, okay, I put out a... This is hijackers, but I put out, take a screenshot for everyone who's interested in working with it, and ace, five. I won't be talking about this board, but everyone interested in uh the result as well uh looking at the cornerstones it's quite interesting that there are not many i'll show this screenshot so now take another screenshot as well for everyone who doesn't have a gto wizard um to just use that for the homework to see that there is really every hand is just indifferent like ace king ace queen and so on like they don't care our advantage is in a certain area that we reach easily with two streets so very very specific board here cool that is a homework screenshot done can't contract gto wizard too much so that was your time getting to the key takeaways then we usually think about the flop when making a plan, right? Especially on ace-high boards where the top pair does not change, right? It's kind of a static board when it comes to top pairs. Because obviously, queen-high board, king might change everything. And ace might change everything. So this is something that's important on ace-high boards. We can plan ahead. On no board, we can plan as good ahead as on Ace-high boards. This is why it makes so much sense to have your game plans ready, to think about them off-table. First of all, Ace-high boards are the ones that come up most often, because every time there's an Ace, it's an Ace-high board. Every time there's a King, it's not necessarily a King-high board. So, this is why most, happening most often, best to plan ahead. It doesn't change often't change often right obviously the straights come in and flushes come in and so on that's it so to to make your plan i want you to think about the overall advantage especially like under the gun i didn't didn't have time to put more examples from early positions in here where we see way more of this ace king jack of that range betting because we have such a big advantage not going after that equity denial idea right just that we always have something so we blow up the pot and take it later but when it comes to building the pot we need to understand that it's all about not advantage it's really here about the nut advantage because if we have an advantage in an area where we try we had the example in the beginning where we try build a pot of like 20 big blinds we can do that later we can do that later like the board won't change dramatically right ace will stay top pair so this is important to understand now think about which pot size do your advantage hands i call it a very german type of making this word um what do they they strive for? What do they try to go for? So think about what is the main difference of your range's preform. This will often be talking about ace-king. Still about kings, queens, and jacks that villain is not having. This is one part of your big advantage. It's an equity advantage. But villain sits maybe on king high and queen high and jack high. And you sit there with kings, queens, jacks. that is worth something. Obviously not when villain has an ace and we all know that ace is coming when we have Kings, Queens and Jacks, so even more important that we prepare that. So this is just important, right? Instead of I have an advantage, Ace high board and so on, right? Like freaking MTT players can always bet because for 20, 30 big blinds, ace-king is always nuts and if someone makes trips, it's okay. But for 100 big blinds, that's not the case. And we've just seen the screenshot of Ace-5-5 where Ace-King is a 50-50 bet. Like, fuck it. I don't know. I build a pot of a little something. Do I do it now? Do I do it later? Like Solver doesn't care. Like the goal is important. All right. And then now comparing to what I showed now with the last two examples is I want you to make your plans. Don't try and play four strategies, four sizings, because you're shaping four different ranges and then you need to hammer on them on the turn. You try to shape them in a way and then on the turn is usually where you get the hammer out. But if you don't know what you shaped first and how your range looks like because you messed up the flop, that hurts, right? The solver is far smarter than all of us together when it comes to figuring stuff like that out. It's a freaking idiot in other areas. But yeah, that's quite important. Simplify and make your game to understand incentivization. What do you try to shape? What do you like most? you play good right um know your cornerstones what is important when you split the range there and you don't get to a range bet um that's that's freaking important that you just know you are prepared for the late game tree with strong hands for the betting game tree with bluffs and so on as last point you know what to prepare for further streets when you can plan ahead after range bet think about already what can happen on the turn all right so all we got here well I stream more stream more it's just like not my timing there are no good games running the times I'm up to be honest so yeah I'm more living the dead life now, getting up early. It really does not make sense to stream. I tried that at some point and stream a little at like 3, 2 in the afternoon. So, yeah, not happening too much.
