### TOPIC: cash postflop blind vs blind after openraising
 I'll start with the introduction again. So this week's session again with Stefan Sontheimer, I mean one of the players I learned from the most, worked with the most too. Our history goes back to 2013 I would say or 14 was it? 14. 14 yeah. March 2014. You're the 14 14 yeah March 2014 I got that random guy asking for my skype like hey we've never met before what about joining us for a couple of weeks in Canada was that actually the first time we we talked maybe in a forum just in a thread direct contact, that was the first one. Crazy. Yeah, I mean, I'm glad I did it. I'm glad I said yes, so why not? Then we spent countless hours working on our heads and sitting in the whirlpool and talking strategy. So that was really fun. And last week we went over a pretty specific spot, DeepStack, UTG against Big Blind, where Stefan showed us, mostly for me, what I took away was the idea of how equilibriums work and how you can actually go from logically thinking about something to then seeing a very similar solution in PIO. And I think that was really, I think also for a lot of people who haven't worked with solvers, who maybe have some respect or don't really understand it, it's like most of it is just, it's just calculating an optimal equity distribution and trying to put that in the right buckets, which actions to choose. And I think Stefan showcased brilliantly how that can work in real life and how you can learn and apply logics in hands you play real time and also off the table. So I'm personally super excited for today's session. As we just talked about it, Stefan is crushing and has been crushing for as long as I remember cash games and high stakes and also dabbled in tournaments, if you can say so, to crush the high there so yeah I'm super happy to have you again thanks for your time and I can't wait for today's session sure let's let's go right away I guess let's do it so let me show first okay what happens here I want to share my screen that looks good i guess that works out so uh fedor everything working smoothly again i can only use my one screen because powerpoint messes up if i use the second one so i don't see the chat you are my my guy for the chat here to interrupt me whenever necessary and um yeah first thing to summarize maybe last week whether you you um you watch it right now or you have been here last week or you're just reviewing it just like still a quick summary where it's exactly exactly what fedor pointed out it's not about that spot and you can say like okay that session is nonsense for me because i'm never playing without anti i play uh different ranges i play mainly shorter it's not about that at all it's just like one specific spot to showcase how like fedor and me were working back back in the days or like still are working in that way to understand the whole thing we want to use pio to understand stuff not we don't want to look at it and learn it by heart, right? It's not a poem that we learn by heart. That can work as well, but it's not my style because I'm lazy. And understanding it just like gives me the tools to really come up with stuff myself. And it was about that. It was about building pot in general, about seabedding, about check raising. And we even talked about little like options of exploiting as well. So today, actually, I might have chosen a spot that most of you play even less than the check raise spot in no anti-game. Because I just said to myself or thought, okay, why? Like choosing something where I'm not really sure about right like just i didn't play a tournament for a year so i won't won't choose a tournament spot but one um that is just like coming up the most frequent it's the most frequent spot in in the world um not exactly like that but we will talk about blind versus blind and since i'm still like playing lots of Zoom whenever I'm bored a little, actually what I do there is playing a race-only strategy first in the small mind. This is different for you, but we can still learn something for that. It will be about range structures and about coming to the agenda there, like about seed bedding. We'll look at it from out of position and really about like that building pot, how to evaluate boards on the flop. You see like weird names on there already, right? It's not about like aggregation reports. It won't be about this or that, how to play top set. It won't be about middle peers, right? We'll have a quick look at the ranges. We'll talk a little about like, start with the quiz again i like it i hope you guys like it too then there is next topic elephant in the room whatever that means right that's just a term that one of my students uh who i coach used and i liked it a lot because he said like okay actually it's the most important spot but he never worked on it right and the elephant in the room is kind of the reason for that. We'll talk about divide and conquer, which is something I took from my programming and informatics class from from uni right into poker little, which is I mean, it's not like a new concept. It's just like cutting things into pieces, especially when they are big. Then we'll look at like some kind of special boards to learn something about how to look at it how to look at at solutions and that that should be it for the theory part already and then look at a couple of hand histories because it's such a big topic i cannot make a lesson and afterwards you know how to play blind versus blind that would that won't work so my goal today is to give you ideas how you can keep working or like improve. If you're like, after the session, this is my goal that you sit there. Okay. If I want to work on blind versus blind, I have an idea what I do next. No, this is my goal. And then it's your job to do it or not do it, right? Or ask other people to do it and then show to you, whatever. I don't care, but you's the case fedor style fedor style right just go for those direct messages right go slide in the dms um i actually i actually want to add something to that uh specifically for everyone in the academy and everyone watching it later on um to really see this as as i did the last session as well um because i think a lot of people have they have a blocker in their mind it's like oh there's a spot that doesn't immediately help them or they don't see how it helps them that they distance themselves from it so you play tournaments and then someone comes with a 200 big blinds keeps their cash game hand and they're like oh i this is not something i play or this is not my thing where i think there's so much value in in looking exactly at these other things and then trying to understand why is that different how why is it even um what can you learn from it for your specific area i always love to play other games and i think this was a big part of why i became so good so fast as I was playing heads up hypersit and goals so I became a lot better in heads up when it was late in tournaments I played cash games like even though I wasn't the biggest winner maybe even a loser in the games I played it was so valuable for my career that I just want to encourage you everyone who's watching and will watch later to see this as a mind experiment and something to just dive in now give your best to try to understand and even if you're not very good at the beginning to see it as a kickstarter for future growth yeah like man it feels like once you talk i i feel like the need to like add something all over the place because it's like we get into that flow of talking about it right it's just like you guys are athletes out there we are athletes in a way like okay i'm ready to eat junk food but that's not the point right it's like and usually when you practice something the last thing you're doing is exactly doing your sports but obviously in the end of a football training you probably play like some kind of smaller football match but well some boxer is rope skipping like forever right it's like don't be scared of doing that right it's practicing even even when you go into a session not every session is about making most db right it's easier to say in cash game i take my afternoons there the owlies are not too good there's just not good action well now in gg there maybe is but like there are good times and bad times and sometimes i'm actually forced myself into the stronger games to learn i don't just say okay i'm focusing on this or that today and this is this is my goal it's not to win a tournament today which is always a bad goal obviously but you get the point so yeah let's dive into the into the spot for now and um I guess we started with the ranges, just a quick view. What I'm talking about, we look at small blind versus big blind ranges, race only. So actually what we see is on the left side, the small blind opening range, it's like 43%, something like that. Linear range, all top hands in there, then some mixes when it gets on the weaker side. okay fedor is like his eyes are bleeding i can see it folding an ace is not an option obviously folding is not an option in his world but this is the thing right on the right side we see big blinds answer to that we're like you see all that you see like strong hands that are clearly missing right hundred? 100% three bets. Aces would be one example for that. You see clear folds and some clear calls and some mixes, right? Those mixes are like starting to prepare a range for the three bet pot. We don't hear about that today, but just have those borders a little in mind, right? Like maybe look at something on the left side, always keep an eye on the borders, right when you play your ranges it's you don't need to learn those by heart now but just like an idea right i know it's not all aces i know the first offsuit hands i'm having are those 9x i don't 8x i'm lacking 7x i pretty much have no offsuit hands um just like stuff like that okay i have all pockets right and then the suited And then the suited side, well, I'm actually just missing the trash. And that's enough, right? That's enough. And I know my range. On the right side, okay, that's more of a mix that we could simplify different ranges and a little tougher to memorize. So I cannot, like do that within one or two sentences. But well, still kind of important to just see like, how many freaking ace-axe offsuit they are. A little less king-axe but like a queen high board is a totally different thing, just looking at that. So this is something we can already take from that. So this is just something to show and then it's next is really looking at the spot we are in now and this is not too big of of a slide and looks confusing because I just took five minutes to make that. But it's about the spot itself. And I'll help you going through that. On the left side, we see like the button versus big blind, or you can say in position versus big blind. Works all the time. Last time we were mainly talking about early position versus big blind. So this is something I'm looking at who has the advantages. Right? We see button will always have equity advantage. There's just no way around it. Always starting with a better range. The board cannot change that much, but we'll always have not advantage kind of right now depends on the stack depth, right? Especially button does not even have like straights that are really lacking. I did three, six a straight okay but he still has all sets etc and the ace is king's queen's advantage plus the button has the positional advantage well and then there is something like nut advantage over time which i placed kind of in the middle because it's like either for one guy or for the other but not a bunch over time always goes a little hand in hand with positional advantage, right? Like when something changes over time, it's always good for the guy in position. So I found that picture of David and Goliath down there. That kind of is what my impression of button versus big blind. You can do with that guy, whatever you want, you can go crazy. Today we're talking about what I would call a fear fight. So small blind has equity advantage starting off with a stronger range. Usually has nut advantage right now as well. But big blind, well, nut advantage over time often for the big blind because he has just like the wider range overall. right? He will hit more hands in the end that small blind probably cannot even have. And nut advantage over time goes again, hand in hand with position. And here, well, obvious, that's this thing that is given. The big blind has the position advantage. So actually what we have here is more of a fair fight and that this is how we should see it, right? Just like even thinking about, okay, we are the aggressor. We should see that all the time or like stupid stuff like that, right? Just see it as a fair fight and that this is how we should see it right just like even thinking about okay we are the aggressor we should see that all the time or like stupid stuff like that i just see it as a fair fight there's different different things like maybe there's stuff happening which is really good for villain sometimes really good for you even button versus big mind if the board is really good for villain well you still have like a whole lot of ev in that one so this is the the spot we want to talk about today. And we'll start again with a little quiz. Fedor will be like your dummy kind of to give the answers. But this time it should be a little easier. So it's only four boards this time. And we just want to order those flops from highest to lowest C-bit frequency again. And yeah, maybe since this is so easy and there's like, actually like there's no hidden stuff, it is actually easy. And yeah, maybe even give an estimation for the frequency. Just like if you feel like everyone take a minute to write it really down, take a pen and a paper, which even at the poker table, you should always have something like that or a notepad when your second screen is working. But yeah, that would be the start to just have a look. Maybe a little hint, you can use everything we talked about last time to solve that. Think about nut advantage right now. Think about nut advantage over time. All you don't need to think about position. That's a given thing this time. Well, always. Michele giving direct percentages on the... What? Okay. Someone wrote exact percentages of Siebert frequency in the chat. I'm very curious. I mean, obviously, there is no correct answer this time because you don't even know my parameters that I put into PIO and how long I ran it. But the order is important but a rough estimation should be good. Actually I find this one pretty interesting because I mean it's again one of these where you say it's super easy but I don't find it so easy. But like I obviously have my favorites um but let's start with your favorite let's let's get we take the favorite and the least favorite and then we get closer okay okay so my favorite is uh probably king 10 5 why that is surprising to me yeah okay um so that was my first instinct. Okay, first instinct was like, I look at, I was thinking about equity advantage of the open raiser. I don't remember exactly the ranges, but I feel that I just have more stronger hands on that King 10-5 and Ace 5-4 board. so I was looking at high cards but then yeah to be honest I don't really have a very clear logic how to approach this I also feel like 6-5-3 given the ranges that you've given as a board that should be c-bet quite frequently so I'm not I don't know like I thought about it and I was like okay this isn't me. Okay. Interesting. So good for everyone listening that even it's like not like super clear and you or everyone in the chat feels like, oh, fuck. Yeah. I feel like I have no clue. So what we look at is first thing, well, not advantage right now. King, 10, 5. We have kings. We have tens. We have fives. One thing to look at, which is always like lots of combinations are straights. So there are no straights for anyone. That's good. And then offsuit two pairs. All right, okay. Both players have all king ten offsuit. All king five. Actually, I can tell you that big blind has it like low frequency, but pretty much never. And ten five is not a thing. So actually, we look at the next best tens, which is then aces and ace king. Well, that's pretty good for the small blind i'd say and then not advantage over time well what will be nuts in the end is the question now well we can build broadway straights which means ace queen ace jack small mind has it always big blind has never ace queen sometimes ace jack um even those two pairs right if it's like there's an ace villain will never have ace king he has queen jack offsuit though but like that not advantage so actually small band has an advantage right now and whatever happens he will keep it over time that's like a pretty clear one and i was obviously trolling this is the one that is highest frequency um and now what's the one with the lowest frequency Thank you. frequency. And now what's the one with the lowest frequency? I just want to share my thought process because I think it might be interesting for the people watching because also for me, like I haven't solved any of these spots for me. It's literally ranges I barely ever touch. And I just tried to approximate. So kind of basically what Stefan said about the King 10-5 flop, this is why it was my favorite. So I'm looking at it. I don't see immediate nuts besides obviously the obvious high equity hands like Kings and what he explained. So very similar thought process I have there. And then I'm looking at the other boards, and it becomes a little more difficult because especially a board like 6-5-3, I find hard to evaluate the positional advantage with deep stack sizes. So let's say hands like 9-10 or 9-8 or something like that, where I have really hard time estimating how much that changes um um for like in in general if you look at these two ranges okay like how much does it change because both don't really have four seven and they're not really offsuit straights there is probably four seven suited uh in there um and then not deuce four suited if i remember correctly for the big blank yes for small but no yeah and so this is also a board i would personally feel like i see that rather frequent um and i wouldn't have put it in my low frequency um range whereas if i look at the other limp pots i know from tournaments with antis and stuff like now this change is totally on this type of board so it's for me really confusing to look at a board like this and then try to rebuild everything And I think that's probably a board that also gets rather a bit more than less that would be one of my guesses um because there's no eight three and then you have jack eight as the open round but not as the as the defender i would say and i also thought that the ace five four was uh rather high so i'm with me putting just high c that frequency board on a board i'm lost okay so i would love to see the chat right now maybe you help us like the chat is allowed to help fit or a little yeah help me guys what's uh i can i can say for now he's totally off i can give you actually the numbers i mean i don't think that it won't help but it might be a little mind-blowing so uh king 10 5 i told you already it's correct and with those ranges it's actually 95 c-bet so we can talk about a range bet here um the next one is kind of a mix and has like 69% CBAT. The third one has 69% CBAT. The third one has 18% CBAT. And the last one obviously has like 5% CBAT, which I'm pretty sure will even go lower if I keep the solver running. Okay. Can you flick one time to the ranges again? And then I put in my solutions. Okay. Okay. Okay. Go back. one time to the ranges again and then sure i put in my solutions okay okay um okay go back okay i take the ace five four as the second highest because we have much more ace x um we want to deny some do do some 3x equity i would i would guess that so i think that must be a high high C bit frequency board. And then you said 18 and almost zero. 18 and five. Yeah. I would guess that. So I think that must be a high C bit frequency board. And then you said 18 and almost zero? 18 and five, yeah. 18 and five. So I would say the Jack 8-3 is 18 and the 6-5-3 is five. Okay. Ordering, I would have ordered this way. That's fine. Now we see it. I was too fast, maybe. But yeah, right? So looking at those things, right? King 10, 5, pretty clear. Why, right? All advantages on our side. Jack 8, 3, well, pretty much all advantages on our side for now as well, right? Since queens, kings, Aces still play a huge role here. It's just like the nut developments won't be as good for us, right, so flush draw, okay, doesn't matter too much, it's more like evening out, so actually when we have an advantage on the board, a flush draw makes it better for the big blind. If we have a disadvantage on the board, the flush draw makes it better for us, right Flushes, everyone has them, so it's kind of evening out. Ace-5-4, well, you mentioned something, but that would work if we were in position maybe not that deep, but you said you want to deny equity from deuce or three, right? But what you would be doing by c-betting is just building a pot because villain is obviously not folding a deuce or a three that you know now know uh now know already that it will develop in something very very bad right it's like okay any deuce any three any four any five any six any seven any eight on the turn you will hate your life it's like ace king is not the hand to go for three streets of value like to start doing that when you know okay nut advantage over time will be on villain's side right just like even those peer things just looking at those ranges again if you just look in that four five three area that all players just have suited it's just like okay small blind is missing and big blind has it that's the big deal well not important now right It's like no reason to make fun of Fedor that the answer was wrong more or less, right? It's just like with, actually I looked at classes presentation where we were talking about like 30 big blinds, blind versus blind, I guess. And there something like the ACE54 was the highest CPET frequency, right? Because there it was just about folding out all those nine, nine ten jack ten type of things where here actually hands that are just just drawing to a second pair i don't care too much about folding them out because it won't be about them in the end um right that would be a reason to see that on that six five three but actually that is just the board where we have such a big disadvantage because again and he does three four five 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 kills it for us. And the small blind is the guy who has all that off to broadways. Okay, so we see first thing, it's not that easy. But now, yeah, it would be, I can ask you right away. Again, let's say you decide to play cash games now. You want to be be the best in the world you traveled back in time 10 years and now this is your goal how would you start studying and why do you think I never started studying blind versus blind in the first place I'm I want to I mean I love this because first of all I think one of the the first things I would like to say here I have no problem at all getting something wrong here and I think neither should you congrats to Mantis for getting it right but don't worry if you're totally off here because I can tell you most of the players will be especially if you take the percentages into account like um what i take away from this is that there is so little shifts between like if you change the ranges slightly you will see drastic shifts and c-bets on certain types of board if you increase the stack depth you will see drastic changes if you like all these parameters have such a big impact on the ranges and i think um also what stefan is always highlighting or um the way i i understood that he's always approached poker is to try to understand the underlying logic is to always try to to understand why this thing is moving in this direction or how it works so that you are able to reproduce and reproduce and abstract from what you learn so if we we look at this, an ACE5 forebought, one of the things that I take away from me is to say, okay, apparently, so I can compare the nut advantage in this scenario, and it clearly isn't a good enough explanation for the low C-bit frequency. So this nut advantage over time or over turns and rivers seems to be a very relevant factor here. So that the positional advantage of the big blind at 100 big blind stacks depth with these type of ranges plays such a big role that we now seem to be seabedding aboard very low frequency that with, I know, lower stack sizes or slightly different slightly different ranges we see that a lot more so this is something super interesting to take away to understand that this slider like on which factors it depends so this would be the first thing I would look at is to understand how different boards over different stack sizes over different ranges change and then try to understand that logic to be able to play every spot great. So yeah, pretty good stuff again. And maybe one last trick or advice that I'm using actually in-game is now just think about where your advantage is, right? I said, okay, on all all those boards actually the small band probably has still the equity advantage when we compare full range versus full range and uh well we look where does that advantage come from it's usually some hands that we have that villain does not have and well on jack eight three i said okay jack eight offsuit not everyone has it all the time so actually queens kings aces still play a huge role here so actually we have a big advantage we say okay where is small blinds advantage on ace five four well it is having ace king it is having ace queen it is having kings queens and jacks and uh all that should trigger right the top part those strong aces for 100 bigs this is just bet bet bet and i have a huge problem if something happens right for like if we play 30 big blinds 40 big blinds we play bet bet bet we are happily going all in for stacks on the river we're like okay you should see just decrease the stack size and the hands that you have that villain does not have actually they are cool now right so uh or like okay ace five four i have kings queens jacks i probably start starting off checking is a pretty good idea right so i would say yeah if we are shorter and villain like villains three betting range will even more shift into blockers i'd always say okay he has even less aces and actually deep people have all kinds of aces because it's the only opposite combination. They are never folding, right? It's only the aces are missing are those that are in the three betting range. So actually an ace high board is pretty good for in position. And yeah, then six, five, three is like, okay, again, maybe you don't have that feeling. But if I look at that board and I feel like, or I imagine that I have pocket kings, I feel like, what the fuck, this will be a big trouble at some point, right? For 40 bigs, I'm like super happy. Whether I start betting big, betting small, or check raising, I don't care, right? I feel good about my hand. Once the four comes there, okay, I might be in trouble, but I'll take all those jack tens and even the nine or an eight um so yeah really think about what can happen what is good for like the handset bring you your advantage which kind of bad stuff can happen for for them right you have pocket aces on the first board well a queen is not great right but it's pretty decent right a nine eight seven six even the five four three deuce it's pretty cool right so um just that as a little little advice to look at that so um yeah now coming to really working on blind versus blind and i mean i had that as like a headline on the agenda already so i had to prepare a picture here is this was my feeling all the time right that's That's like, okay, there's blind versus blind. I'm very bad at that, or I always was, and probably still am, because the spot itself is just too big, right? And I'm just talking about that from a cash game player's perspective. I'm always playing without ICM. I'm always playing 100 to, let's say, 200 BB stack size really deeper like really effectively so it's like one parameter is always the same for me but it's still and i'm playing race first in only so it's really even that range is always the same it's still all kinds of ports and it's when you look at pilots and mix all the time it's really like like yeah that would be my question to you fedor if i tell you okay you have to master freaking blind versus blind as good as possible you will have like test for you right and you have tomorrow time to use 12 hours in two days you have your test how would you think about blind versus blind what would you do to learn to get the most out of your time oh i mean i love that question you know that uh i mean i've always my whole career and and you know that probably better than anyone else is i was always about simplification and bunching and aggregation even when we were when we didn't have solvers or solutions. So I would find the, if I look at all the data that is possible, I would try to find the most representative data points for the largest parts of data. So first I would look at boards. If I look at boards, I would try to look for patterns where there's clear repetitions in board structures to try to bunch that as good as possible. And then go from the ones, that's also a thing that I think a lot of players make the mistake of. I try to look for the ones where I'm the worst at. So especially if I know, okay, let's say there's too many patterns. So let's say there's 50 to 100 different patterns and i cannot find a very clear rule or structure or logic and then i try to go from the ones where i feel i'm intuitively the most off so i would first like with these boards i wouldn't look at the king 10-5 board because i intuitively feel like i'm going to make the least mistakes on this board i would look at the 6 653 board and I would look at the ACE54 board. I would not look at, I would like, for example, I would look at the ACE9 deuce rainbow board once, but I wouldn't look at it so much in depth because I feel that I, that there's going to be certain things where once you understood them, or once you have a good approximation, you're not going to make so many follow-up mistakes because there's, for example, less shifts in equities on different turns and rivers. So this is the first thing I would look at on flops. And then the second thing I find personally the most important is to look at the things where you put in the most big blinds, especially in cash games. So now, okay, we look at flop structures, but I feel most of the people work on the flop and they rarely look at like turns and rivers. So this would be actually the thing I would get in the deepest about is to understand more about different equity shifts on turns and then according strategies on turns, because I feel what I understand more now and now is if I look at these aggregation reports of different turns, I feel that I can do that quite well already to say, okay, this turn card favors this range, this river card favors this range and by how much. And now to understand how that changes the strategy. So in our last example that you did last week, where a different turn card comes and then I know roughly, okay, I rather want to overbet this turn card with most of my range or I rather want to check now because my range heavily lacks against opponent's range. So these would be the two main things I would be looking at. Okay, yeah, pretty good stuff. So first of all, really most important point that I want to like really really emphasize here again because it won't be in the in that presentation is really that looking for where you are versed right it's not it sounds bad to look at stuff where you're versed because you don't like it you won't enjoy it right everyone likes that stuff where he's good anyways to get even better to tell your buddies you are the best in that spot or i don't know right there's some something stupid so i want to i want to pretty much reframe that and not say like i want to look at what i'm versed at we are looking i mean when we are learning poker we want we're trying to improve right so we're looking for the spot with most room for improvement right to just have a like positive way of saying that because that's like sounds like way more promising to work on something that i'm shit at that i like sounds like okay you have to go in solver jail right and like study there with uh all all our solver jail friends right it's like i don't know like i want to be happy doing that but just because like getting really better at something it's like the best thing you can get out of it and this is, I mean, I can speak for the two of us. This is where we got the most out of poker for sure, right? Really having that aha moment. It's like, okay, I sucked there. Now I kind of understand it. I have an idea. Maybe I have to test and reevaluate and try it in game. But whoa, I could ask you guys now, how does a check, like, okay, I told you on 653, we we are pretty much checking range and i could ask you now for a check raising range you will try to apply what we learned last week which would be totally off i can tell you right because it's a totally different concept when well we want to be check raising but actually the nuts over time is something for a big blind for the other guy guy. That would be actually like we are check-raising with the plan for not like hitting straights and stuff on 6-5-3, but for hitting that offsuit king that doesn't help villain at all. That would be a totally different perspective for like, okay, just like saying stuff like that helps. And now what I wanted to like, I was looking for those patterns today right so i just made the next one here like divide and conquer right it's like really it we have that huge elephant in the room and it scares the shit out of me like where do i even want to start i have no clue right so actually realizing that as a problem and then solve that problem first okay that elephant is too big i need to narrow it down i cannot work on blind versus blind it's impossible i can let's say work on blind versus blind on ace high dry boards if i want to but maybe that is small enough that i work on that and then like after learning something i always want to have that feeling in game oh i'm crushing the spot right like small blind? Like small blind first in, board comes ace, nine deuce, I'm crushing it, right? It will never happen that you say I worked on blind versus blind. Oh, I'm blind versus blind. Now I'm thrilled. I'm crushing it, right? It's like not possible. It's just too much. And this was always my feeling. So I was like, I'm like a tight ranges guy, right? I love those three bad pots, four bad pots. Like I can fold the shit out of it. No problem, right? I'm not the crazy guy. I love those three bad pots four bad pots like i can fold the shit out of it no problem right i'm not the crazy guy i love early position versus big blind check raising some cards and villain cannot have it or i can fold because i don't have it it's it's whatever um but yeah like what i i came up for that is like really we have all those tools to describe boards wet board dry board connected board whatever by height card but i want to get the most out of it which peter said already as well right when we talk about turn about river about whatever right so i actually wanted to split them up by strategy that was my plan because like i don't care how the board looks like if i can play the same strategy on it i will have the same way to get to the turn and then I can probably play the same strategy there as well depending on the turn card and well whether the board is six high or ace high when I have to range check that's pretty good right because that makes it easy for me to transfer everything that I've learned to other spots I don't care how how the board looks like. It does not matter, right? Having that list of all A-side boards that are like from 100% CBET to 0% CBET and that exists, right? Probably the 100% CBET does not exist, but the zero for sure exists. So yeah, that does not help me. And then looking at the same list for King High boards again, right? This is those aggregation reports that lots of people are doing, which is a huge list, but not a smart way of finding patterns Thank you. at the same list for king high boards again. This is those aggregation reports that lots of people are doing which is a huge list but not a smart way of finding patterns or clustering stuff. So now again to show what the plan is I obviously had to find those elephants here. This is the plan we make those small ones and carry them out of the room to not be scared anymore. That's kind of the plan. And even, we can see, okay, we have those tiny problems. It's still someone protecting them and we might be a little scared, but we can definitely tackle that left upper one there. And yeah, let me just see what's next. Actually, last time I didn't like to go through that presentation blind, so I have it on my laptop here as well. Okay, so yeah, next slide is pretty much just showing how I split those boards to make it as simple as possible. It looks again like a huge slide here now and it's just three different types of boards. On the left side I said okay those boards, number one, I take those that are a range bet or even close to a range bet because first pretty cool thing the flop strategy is solved for me now it's over right i solved that by just using that way of clustering and so next time i can look at it okay i'm super happy happy i have a range bet board and uh the other the next stuff to learn is just, well, what happens if villain raises, which is never happening in the first place? And the second thing, okay, what's my turn continuation? Then I'm on the turn, two streets left, more information, easier solution, right? It's like starting the solver on the turn. It takes the solver seconds, right. Blind versus blind takes him, well, on my computer, 20 minutes to 30 minutes to get like an okay answer. So just showing you how much simpler something got. And yeah, next problems versus raise, turn continuation, flop strategy solved, range bet. Now we just need to find out which boards exist, right? Which is, okay, I split it up and having advantages. I'm looking for those boards who have equity advantage. I always have that pretty much not advantage right now, not advantage over time. So it's especially that over time just leads us to boards where we will have the straights that will get there. Or where nothing changes. When nothing changes and I have an advantage, I pretty much have the advantage over time as well. But I could just tell you a few boards that, well, let's start with KK3. That's a pretty good one. We can take that K10-5 we had. We can take Q10-4. We can take J10-deuce. Ace-high boards are a little special because there's like less incentive to be denying equity. On ace-high boards, our advantage partly is something like pocket queens, pocket kings that are not necessarily into betting too much, right? It's just falling out hands that pretty much have zero percent equity against them. So it's like I would exclude them a little. We can treat them as like an, I don't know, exception, whatever, right? But there are plenty of those range bet boards, pretty much anything with a high card king, queen, or jack that gives us all the straight connectivities for the small black. Okay, let's look at the very right side. Start with the simple stuff here. Range check or close to range check. It's really those boards where we might not even have the nut advantage right now, but definitely won't have the nut advantage over time and therefore positional disadvantage is a huge problem for us. So this can be something like 6-5-3, right? Then that could be something like 8-7-6, right? Straight on the board right away that villain has all the time. Or like 4-5-6, even worse. That can be monotone boards. We're like, okay, just us betting makes it super easy for villain. He has all the flushes in the world. world it's like not that we have the biggest disadvantage in the world but position just matters a lot on the monotone board um could be i don't know like ace five four with the flush draw even though whether it's like 18 cbet or just 15 or even 20 it's closer to that range check so actually what did we? By just using that cluster we solved the flop strategy. We don't even have to think about it. Next problems here would be well how to react versus a bet and how to react on the turn after check check. Where I split those up again when I'm learning because I cannot influence really what villain is raising i can prepare myself how to play versus the perfect bot but that won't happen in game so i don't care too much right i need to react i can think about incentives what happens if he uses small bets what happens if he uses big bets what if he raises high frequency what if he raises low frequency which they are all doing um and the other thing versus bet right like i don't know right i don't know his frequency i don't know his bet sizing i don't know his back check back frequency well not that necessarily but um yeah so i thought i called them actually like action game and reaction game right when like i'm c betting villain calls i know this happening all the time this is something i want to focus on and then like i don't need to look at the queen 10 deuce king 10 5 on the flop because i can just start on the turn and i can make different turn cards what happens on a break king 10 5 deuce what happens on a bad card king 10 5 10 well is it that bad if i bet the range i don't know what happens on like a card? King, 10, 5, 10. Is it that bad if I bet the range? I don't know. What happens on like a card where villain makes all offsuit straights? King, 10, 5, 9. And what happens on a card where, well, let's say an ace, whatever. What happens after checking range and villain checks back, right? Then it's again kind of game it's my it's my turn again what happens on a high card what happens on a straight connection card well that would be something okay i just clustered in that way that the flop strategy is solved so i can just like skip it and just jump right to the turn and you might think it's now very exceptional boards which is is like maybe partly true, but well, they come up often, trust me. And then actually by looking at those two, we have the third type. And I call it the trade-off board because it's like partly on the left side, partly on the right side, which just means we are sometimes c-betting, we are sometimes checking. And these are the boards where I need to look at the flop. So far, I'm just talking about one sizing. That can be some, there are some more exceptions, right? But it will be rarely that we use big bets, right? There are some boards where that makes sense, right? Where there's no equity to be denied and we start charging draws or like really applying more pressure now because Willem's floats are just all too high equity. Let's just give examples, right? Let right let's say nine five deuce a small bet does not make too much sense when being deep stack because villain always has backdoor straight plus over cards we are not attacking any part of his range pretty much something like ace jack eight with a flush draw is not too good to start up betting small because what you're what you're folding out by a small bet is something that has zero percent villain will be folding is four or five nothing but actually like is that like beneficial for us not really um so we need to like find other other reasons to use like other bet sizings just a couple of examples and um yeah no i'll i want to talk about that trade off trade off board a little more because we're just talking the flop today and i showed you three options now how i split up blind versus blind spots and on two of them we already solved together the flop strategy by just simply finding the shit out of it the trade off board will be all kinds of boards that where we have one bet size and a check as well maybe even two bet sizes i don't care and i just took this one as an example let's take jack seven three with two spades small one has not advantage right now he won't have it over time a three is bad a four is a five is bad, a six is bad, a seven is bad, an eight, nine, not necessarily great. Broadway cards are awesome. A jack is okay, I guess. But now, well, if we, now I ask you the question, if we would look at Pio Solver now, what would be highest to lowest betting frequency of those hands just think about how often you have pocket aces with the ace of spades and the ace of diamonds how often would you be betting you have king queen of hearts how often would you be betting you have jack of clubs four of clubs how often would you be betting it's not about the right frequency here. You can guess that as well. That would be very advanced. But yeah, just try to put those in order. It's super tough this time because it's seven different ones. But yeah, on the next slide, you will see my order. I did that without looking at PIO. So, and I'm not lying to you guys here and then we can compare those so everyone again pen and paper write down your list and maybe at the same time think about which of those is important to get right and which of those is like not that important Thank you. which of those is important to get right and which of those is like not that important. Okay, take your minute. I'll check where I watch Champions League tonight when you guys are winning bracelets. Thank you. so Thank you. so Wow. Wow. You ready, Fedor? Yeah, give me one second. There was one question in the chat before that I wanted to bring up. Michela asked around when you do the simplification, what's kind of your threshold of simplifying? So if you say, okay, above 80%, above 85 above 85 90 do you look at the v different actually i mean that would be something you could be doing but like when i prepare my strategies really for for like my games i think more about like putting exploitative thoughts in there where i say like okay What would be the right answer for villain and is he doing that at all? We're like my I can say that for for my games even though it's pretty high and like people should be good people are not they are simplifying and Are not like playing perfect small raising ranges So actually that allows me to see better higher frequency with exactly those threshold hands Like I would say my line is more about like more or less 80%. Right where it's like, okay, actually when I arranged because those 20% that I shouldn't see that there is like, mainly like 10 to 15% hands that I could see that and just like five to 10% see uh or five percent five to ten percent of hands that really prefer the check but well then start having that checking range and everything else is built around that so if you ask me for a number I would say 80 but double check that in your games right if people are raising like crazy well maybe you don't want to c-bet your kings on like a seven deuce even. Yeah, that will be the answer for that. It's actually crazy. I'm looking in the chat right now. And I think my hypothesis here would be that this is a huge thing for you guys to improve. Because most of the things I see right now is kind of sorting uh value hands from top to bottom um and and i think this is really important right now to to to do this quiz and challenge it and i'm very looking forward to me failing you might get disappointed i might be disappointed maybe i maybe i'm wrong maybe i I'm wrong. Let's see. Let's see. You're ready to go? I'm somewhat ready to go, yeah. Okay. So it's all up to you. You give us your answer. Highest frequency for me is Queens. Why? It's one of the value hands i want to bet the most i do have in my check raising range as well but uh just i have way more incentive than with aces for example uh for him to give him like to charge equity from uh pairs over cards king x um and want to build a pot now also have backdoor spades um increases my nut equity over time pretty nice yeah that is true um yeah i don't know it's just a hand that that comes to mind to me when i look at this list that i would like to but quite high frequency. What is your last one? Let's, let's. Yeah, I don't know just a hand that comes to mind to me when I look at this list that I would like to bet quite high frequency What is your last one let's let's get closer from both sides again, um My last one is actually I just switched a little bit My last one is actually aces of the hands on this list. I see that ace is the least. Okay Yeah one is actually aces of the hands on this list uh i see that ace is the least okay yeah um yeah you would like not in your games but i'm asking you are asked to play payo now or linus you would still check aces the most no if i i don't know if i look at these hands and think about the optimal solution yeah i do think that aces is because i feel most of them are not so but i know you chose uh i chose wisely you chose wisely so yes uh but i'm just trying to be as honest as possible and so yeah okay just i want to leave exploitative parts like i don't want to have that excuse in the end yeah but in my games they all overfold and that's why okay that's that's good just like that's the the point of it no i i would i would see that ace is uh quite like maybe a quarter or third of the time and i actually wouldn't see that any of the other hands much less so okay sounds great so yeah I don't know actually actually I might like now looking at it, I might change that to deuces, but... Yeah, the teacher got the exam already. No changes possible anymore. It's okay. And then just continue or... Yeah, now let's go second highest just like give us some some thoughts put some thoughts out there it's not obviously it's not about the list it's about the way like thinking process in the end yeah so i actually do have jack for pretty low so my my bottom my bottom list was jack for aces were on my bottom um then my uh then next was deuces um Thank you. on my bottom. Then my next was deuces and in the middle I had like king nine, king queen and ten six, whereas ten six was my highest c-bet. Reason being I have some backdoors, it's just a hand. And I'm actually not really sure, but my intuition was like, okay, I would like to see that this hand. I actually cannot really explain why I have some backdoor equity can make some. Maybe good feeling? Maybe good feeling. Yeah, just backdoor straights that I can pick up, that I can bluff some blockers potentially on some runouts just a hand I don't know I would choose um and king nine king queen I feel as pretty decent check calls but also hands I want to be betting sometimes to have those nuts um in in my range on certain runouts um and for deuces I didn't really have a very like for deuces it could be anything between and checking and just trying to check it down. As similar. for deuces I didn't really have a very like for deuces it could be anything between checking and just trying to check it down as similar to trying to fold out some hands and potentially having that deuce set not equity so I feel like it's going to be a bet sometimes but have actually no not much of a clue. Okay, like can you like, good stuff. Can you maybe summarize a little what is there's anything in the chat going on some some people risking their head and trying to speak out loud? Actually, most of the things I've read were that the pairs and over pairs were the highest seed betting frequency. So it was basically mostly aces or queens and then jack four the highest. I mean some people, so it was basically split between people putting jack four as high c-bit frequencies or as pretty much bottom. And then let me check, and then yeah some who basically had 10-6 as their, most of them had 10-6 as their last with almost no c-bet. And I think I was the only one who put it quite high. So, yeah, and then regarding the king-queen, king-nine, most of them had them in their middle. and 10-6 as their last and deuces were pretty mixed between first and last actually like there was all kinds of answers regarding that okay good so actually you try you guys now obviously i'm not obviously but it was kind of a little trick question because you guys went for the answer for like the the poker code master class super high class whatever you want to call it but we're still in the poker code academy and therefore i made a little easier answer which i think is everything we need to know actually and this is still like my thought process on when playing nl 10k right so it's kind of it brings you to to a certain level for sure right what we are talking about here as well is like or taking into account is trying like how do blockers work right okay that's that's a deal whether like okay aces queens are like kind of the same strength well villain cannot have kings but queens benefit benefit more from villain folding out stuff. Aces, well, they want to make villains king, queen, check back and hit their king or queen. Just like stuff like that. I mean, king, queen is calling anyways, but still that kind of thought process, which is like, yeah, it's like probably even too much, I would say here. And this is now how I ordered them. And I actually made just two groups. 10-6 and deuces are 0% CBETs for me. Yes. And all the others, they are a mix. And I really mean it when I say there, I don't care. Like it's actually like now talking about what is effective and efficient learning is like whether I know in the end whether I should split aces 30-70 or 50-50. Like I should always be capable of finding better reasons than just the Pio split that I can use in game right this guy is always stabbing so i check and check race this time this guy is just like call happy but not active himself so i keep the betting lead myself right and what you what you see here is actually what most of the people apparently did in the chat looking a little at value hands because we will change that thing of like value bluff whatever again to one thing because here maybe it's on the next level i'll just talk about it right away it's just am i ready to build a pot i'm not betting range so actually let's start with those hands that don't want to build a pot right that's our are those bottom 10, 20% that are just check folds. If I have a checking range, I have a check folding range. So I have the right to just pretty much throw my trash away. So what I'm looking here is looking for my biggest trash, right? Or the other way around, those hands that are ready to build a pot, they want to have not just equity against villains full range but equity against villains continuing range so we want to have equity against 3x against 7x against jack x against flush draws against straight draws against everything that might be calling we're like okay um king queen of heart a king is a good card it's an over card a queen is a good card it's an over card hearts are pretty great it's a backdoor flush draw backdoor straight draw well jack four i mean i have a jack right it's a value bet so actually it's fine building a pot queens anyways the check race might be the even better option right but it's for me it's now it's about building a pot king of spades nine backdoor straight over card backdoor flush draw right being precise with what we are having it's not here and king nine is not a backdoor when you call 10-6 a backdoor as well right 10-6 is a backdoor with like a draw to a second or third pair maybe fourth pair at some point and a backdoor to a one card straight which has a totally different value than the queen 10 run out when having king nine, for example. So just this year, seeing it as something, okay, it's a mixed board. We have a checking range and the important stuff is the check fold. And now we're going to improve the, to like look that up with pile. So I took that pile sim here. I actually offered two sizings and on the right side, you can see most of the hands we just had there. So what you see here is that whole big elephant in the room. You look at that sim, you try to learn blind versus blind. It's fucked up, right? You have a beer, you stop doing it. That would be my approach, right? Looking at that, like having no clue, okay. But now I said, okay, actually like what I did was I clustered. Now I make that tough job looking at that, let's call it baby elephant still. And I know, okay, it's a mix. But what is important? It's really those hands that are clear things. So actually here, it's still a suit mix. You can't find a single hand that always wants to get checked. Even the deuces have like some traces of betting here, which is, well, if we could zoom in here now, it would be the deuce of spades. Having at least the vector flush draw would lead to the solver showing us a little betting frequency, which actually if i keep it running for for days it would disappear but here we are just looking at it and now i want to look at those numbers right we are actually just to give you the input we are playing my zoom 500 games here so the pot is after opening to 3x from the small bind someone calling is 30 dollars big maybe a little a little less because they take shitloads of rake, but our options are a 75% c-bet, a 30% c-bet, and a check. And what I mean with it's a mix, I don't care, is nothing else but looking at those EVs. But actually, if the solver runs forever, check and small bet will have same EV. If that wouldn't be the case it wouldn't be a mix solver chooses best strategy. So what you see here okay big bet will disappear it's a mix of small and big and it looks right now like 50-50 maybe it it goes a little into one direction but whatever right. So on the other hand king of spades nine right okay it's a little more into betting than into checking, but let's have a look at the EVs. It's again again my answer i don't give a shit jack four of clubs again i don't give a shit king queen of hearts i don't give a shit the only mistake we can be doing on the flop is those hundred percenters ten six of diamonds by betting probably not against the normal opponents in a tournament. I'm pretty sure Fedor can turn things around here, but if he was playing Payo, he wouldn't have a chance and he's just losing 45 cents here, which adds up over time. Pocket deuces, well, a little less but still losing. It's really that, are we having equity? are we to build a pot and well some others are just whether you randomize i don't care actually for me randomizing is the last option and just do it against really good players whenever i have a chance i just next one would be i try to find reads right like and if i don't have them i at least have population tendencies or pool reads and i know like okay check raising queens here is a little cooler probably not right it's most of the time against weaker opponents it's just about keeping the betting lead because then you are deciding what what's happening so with queens again if i'm like forced to play a random wsop tournament now um i will always see that my queens right right? For that equity denial effect, falling out king X, ace X, having that value. And I will check my aces as does Fedor, right? But if playing perfect opponents, understanding Pio, looking at that mix, and this is what I want to like tell you guys, is actually, I love seeing that mix these days. Everything I have to find out is those bottom 10, 20% that are not interested in building a pod, they are mandatory checks. Everything else, it's not that I have to come up with that mix here. It just means I have three options and I can choose. I'm the boss. It's not Pio telling me what to do. Pio has the right to tell me it's same EV. Don't give a shit. Make use of what else you know, which other information you have. And then it is like, okay, pocket jacks, probably a small bet, but check call might be a thing too. And now this is the big, big, big difference to imposition where we have very, very pure strategies and just always some in-between mixes is what leads us to that. Oh, I missed one. I thought I have one more slide here. I missed that one. Let me see. I can't what did I miss got a double check here. Give me one second. Okay, not working but okay, then I missed it and I'll just talk to you and it's really that the big difference when thinking about a c-bet out of position compared to think about a c-bet in position is, well, we have multiple options to build a pot. Building a pot in position, the only option for us is to be betting. So, okay, we can check back and hope for Willen because he has not ventured ever to start crazy over betting but actually we are killing one street of action which is always bad for the guy who has the nut advantage so out of position we have multiple options we can build a pot by betting small we can build a pot by betting big we can build a pot by check calling we can build a pot by check raising four options once there is a check that doesn't mean i'm not interested in building a pot but when we have hands that are not interested in building a pot we only have one option but actually what we should think about out of position is our check folding range when in position we are mainly thinking about our nutted range because those are the hands that have to take one specific action to pretty much fulfill their goal to get to get what they want to do right i want to fold my 10 six of diamonds here maybe king deuce of clubs even though having an overcard works as well and um yeah that already maybe i go to the last slide then right this is for, the understanding of all that. I don't care. It's a mix. It's not, I have to learn the mix. It's really just about understanding what that means and where is the EV coming from? Or let's say, where's the problem where I might lose EV? Yeah, that would be the main takeaway actually for today. I could go deeper into turn and river continuations but that's up to you now right because i gave you the framework for like different kinds of boards splitting them them up a little by strategy first range bet super easy keep going with turn continuation then range check super easy you are in a reaction game reacting is always a little easier than acting yourself and then well the trade-off words were actually what happens here is what we create is a c-pad range that is stronger right because we exclude all our check folds our checking range is clearly the weaker range our range is the stronger range. And this leads to a situation that we actually know from another spot. And well, after betting a stronger range on a trade-off board, that range looks exactly kind of the same like the range bet on a range bet board. So actually, I can cluster them together again once we are on the turn after c betting and again the checking range on those sports it's not only here don't get that wrong right we need to mix in those nuts right we can put some deuces and what is some threes and sevens in there as well and some aces and some well seven eight some jack ten some jack four whatever actually our checking range is comparable to our checking range on range check boards so actually on the when we talk about turn continuations or like the reaction game on the flop we just have two things to think about again right next small elephants that we can tackle and maybe conquer a little right so it's really that divide and conquer as like great tool to split those problems up that we are having and this is something we want to do by really thinking about it by finding good ways and now having that framework i'm i'm pretty sure fedor could do a hell of a good job learning learning for his exam tomorrow for 12 hours and then crush it in two days. Yeah, that would be like the main point for today, actually. And then I have just a little action game outlook with two hand histories and the reaction game, the way I split it up with a little outlook two hands but let's let's feed or maybe say something to all that ideas and stuff first i think you are muted or just for me fit or maybe yes sorry now um yeah one thing i mean i think this is super insightful um generally to understand okay where is he be close where you need to make sure that you make the right choice um the first thing that comes to my mind is when i see that is um i mean obviously when you started talking i realized my mistake for me i could really tell that 10-6 suited for me is uh is more in the middle of my range whereas with these ranges it's more at the bottom of the range yeah um so that was the first thing i i've realized to always be sure of like okay what given the action pre-flop or the action before is like okay and which type of framework of of ranges are we actually uh in right now so this is the thing i take away uh first and then the second thing i want to i want to add to what stefan said is yes you can mix and you can be free in what actions you choose but also you will have you will have habits and you will have bias so especially if we play lower stakes or mid stakes try to be aware of what your general biases are right so um especially if you have this approach oh it doesn't matter like if you bet or you check whereas in the optimal solution ev runs really close but it it runs so close because it is so balanced between these different options so if you start betting all your good hands and then you start checking all your weak hands obviously that's something that good opponents are going to pick up on um and i think that's also something to keep in mind is that you that you don't take out too much of the complexity of the game that you start thinking about check calls start thinking about check raises um how to continue on later streets and not just uh bet all your good hands and check all your weekends and be done with it so just something i wanted to to bring in there so when you make still think about um being a tough Thank you. and check all your weak hands and be done with it. So just something I wanted to bring in there. So when you make still think about being a tough or tricky opponent. Yeah, here we go. So let's have a look at one, two, three hands maybe, or let's start with that little outlook. I call it action game, right? This is now getting into those range bet boards or a trade-off board where we decided to see but this time right so first this happens here um which is mainly those boards where we have another bunch right now and have some kind of nutted bunch over time right not necessarily on that trade-off boards but then we'll get there on the to the turn with a stronger range right which is again our job on the turn right which would like be too much for now um to really evaluate the turn card how it plays with both ranges but this is something we do all the time right it's just one new card how does it change does villain have the straights right really thinking about the nutsense does villains uh am i the only one making straights think about the river ahead right it's a different thing when it's like 10-4 deuce and there is a king it's not just about that king it's that i will make river straights on the river and villain won't for example um and then one thing we'll talk about when looking at the hand is something like the lookalike principle The thing is that ranges are so wide, we cannot break it down to combos. So we need to have like certain concepts. We talked about not equity today again. I just talked about is the hand willing to build a pot in general? Well, every backdoor helps, every overcard helps, every something helps. But yeah, lookalike principle will be another thing where I say, okay, I put hands in two groups that villain cannot make use of blockers. If I check all my ace highs, I will probably check my aces as well, right? If I see that, if I check my top set, I will check, if I check my top pairs, I will check my top set as well. Or which happens more often that we, for example, see that mid pair and then check it on the turn. What should I do with my mid set as well or which happens more often that we for example c-bet a mid pair and then check it on the turn what should i do with my mid set hmm good question bet because i have a value hand not necessarily right betting is not the only option to get money in the middle so by staying balanced at the same time um and yeah with attacking villains range parts is actually like i mean as well like where are his pain points again like what what can i tackle right we're like we talked after the check race about the turn continuation well a small bet often doesn't make sense because villain does not have a snap fall part for example here that might be the case right jack seven three small bet villain floats every ace high turn is a freaking king why not put out a very small bet again villain has Thank you. case right jack 7-3 small bet villain floats every ace high turn is a freaking king why not put out a very small bet again villain has all freaking a size right just like which bet sizes are optional right when fedor said okay he learns for that exam he will actually look more into turns uh on like especially the boards he feels good with on the flop and he looks on those boards he doesn't feel comfortable with just on the flop right away it's like okay can you tell me what is happening like king ten deuce and then there is a five on the turn yeah it's kind of tough so let's take a quick look I'm not sure maybe you see all that stuff here no but I don't care so let's start with that one don't need a hut okay so I'll make that a little bigger and we'll just start up I guess that is like zoom 500 we play against by that time pretty unknown to me no clue whether he moved up from soon 200 or he's just a random he looked I think he had like Gregor stats I'm not sure. So first of all, I'll ask you what kind of board is that? All right, I split that up So I'm not playing blind versus blind and playing one more specific spot here What you mean one more specific Yeah, is it is it pretty much for type one where range bet? Is it a range check or is it a trade-off board? Or somewhere between range bet and trade-off, probably high CBET frequency. Yeah, it's like maybe, yeah, it will be probably like 80% CBET frequency, maybe even 85 where it's like for us now, we have like, this is what we can learn from PIO. And then we have to decide, is it good enough for us to just simplify in range bet, for example, right? Or am I checking my freaking pocket nines? That's pretty much the question, right? I would even put it in the range bet category to simplify against an unknown will be fine, right? So I use that small bet here. I will, I have the advantage now. I will keep it over time. So I don't need to blow up a pot right here. Something like pocket queens might be a first hand that finds a reason if you look it up in pile, but actually a big bet is not used too often there. Might be again one of the exploits if I know villain is never raising. So that happens. Turn is an eight. Right now, my job, I should know the ranges. Well, you've only seen them once. It's different ranges than in tournaments. But well, I need to evaluate how good is that eight for my range and how good is it for villain's range and which sizings should I use overall. I don't care. I'm not even like I'm talking. I'm not even looking at my my freaking top set here That's I'm not interested in my hand at that point of time So what would you think just like going through the process once how do you evaluate that part of that eight on the turn? So my intuition without really consciously thinking about much would be a rather large bet So I'm thinking here that a lot of hands that do have incentive to bet um i'm blocking so jack x specifically um and that there's a lot of hands that are worse than my hand but still have decent equity like eight nine six nine six seven eight seven ten nine ten seven where i would say i don't think too many of them should be betting on the turn some but not not all of them and I basically feel like my hand is way too high up my range to be checking I don't really feel particularly great about the check raise I think it's not not a good candidate for that necessarily I would rather check raise weaker sets because he doesn't have jacks and tens i would rather check raise sixes or eights because then i get bets from jack x so for me this is a category uh very high frequency large bet okay which options overall do you give yourself like if i tell you okay you're full range you were talking mainly about pocket jacks yeah um which sizings do you allow to yourself um i do have some small bets um because there are still these king x ace x type of floats on the flop especially against the small sizing so i do want to have some small bets especially with the hands that do have decent equity against those hands can continue but I don't know. So I do want to have some small bets, especially with the hands that do have decent equity against those hands can continue, but there's also quite some better hands in Villain's range. Not too many though will be a frequency, but I think not too many. I want to have a big betting frequency as I just said, and I definitely want to do have quite some checks because i think the turn card is rather good for rather good for villain so i think i would rather look at a low frequency see that on the turn overall range okay yeah so a couple of very good things right evaluating so um let's let's look at the nut part first right where it's it's really okay seven nine off partly um depends on the spot maybe always right queen nine off he always has it so it's really it's very different than having a queen here or an or or well or a king right so he has all the straights so actually what happens is now just going berserk with over bets is not an option right villain is protected it was just be too easy for him to react right just like betting three times the pot to then jam the river is the first option we need to kill just because of that um and then well we have like let's say i take maybe what you meant with like big bet i call that always normal bets like 75 percentish um which makes a lot of sense right we can charge eight nine like what is doing with like random 10x with no we have draws ourselves with lots of high equity hands that are non-made hands so um yeah keeping that fold equity and one important point here is really that okay actually small bet makes sense as well uh because william probably should float all his random ace-x with a diamond, right? Like some king-x. What is he doing here with like a king-7 with a king of diamonds on the flop? Just like that small bet, we keep that range quite wide. And now it's the, okay, and obviously we have check as well, right? Where, okay, you said, okay, like you probably check raise weaker sets right to attack that jack x maybe even allow more jack x two peers where our main value comes from uh it's like we don't against jack x we won't play for stacks when villain is protected with like 32 combinations of straights so um yeah that's that's kind of questionable here my problem is with a big bet is okay we are blocking that jack x which is his main calling range as that's kind of questionable. Here, my problem is with a big bet is, okay, we are blocking that jack-axe, which is his main calling range as well. That kind of sucks. And we are playing against a range that consists of like straight draws and straights, which in theory should have the last word. And we are playing on the river, probably for stacks when he wants to, which then, okay, like is he value jammingming worse maybe some worse sets that he should raise before but then it's like okay we we choose something where our jacks are maybe a bluff catcher in the end that would suck as well so um actually i looked it up and it's like the big bet is never a thing over bet is never a thing and it's actually a mix a mix between a bet and a small bet and a check. I chose in-game here and I'm happy about that. That small bet, which is just like really keeping everything in. I cannot deny equity from the straight draws. They keep calling. I can maybe fold out a random single queen and I cannot really fold out a nine. But I would need to use an overbet, which I cannot because villain is protected. So what I do is I would be charging his draws out of position. But actually what is really happening is just building a pot where I know lots of rivers will be tough, right? Having top set, betting big, betting big. Any diamond on the river, any seven, any queen, it would kill the spot a little. And here that gives me more room where obviously when he raises, that's pretty sweet. But still at that point, he should be mainly built around like more straight D stuff. So it's just a pretty clear call. And while we obviously bink it, I won't show any losing hands guys. So yeah. And, and he had it, but just like as that first idea turn evaluation card but really first process is we are not playing blind versus blank we are playing blind versus blind a board that is pretty close to range bets so everything we start thinking about right away is the turn right we didn't even talk about the flop really that's the main point here um so probably the next one is not that one never loses hands exactly yeah i'm never showing well for for like crying reasons obviously unless on tv then and yeah because i'm never lucky but now i changed that image and i show lucky hands okay let's take the next one we're playing a really really strong wreck who'Vor's up to 10K this time on NL1K. I find beautiful aces. Queen 6-2s. What kind of board is that? I would put it in the second category trade-off. Yeah, like I think even it might be still kind of close to the range bet uh i would put it in the second as well if it was queen seven deuce i would lean to the first one uh just because the straight developments are not there and it would be one of the category that we didn't talk about that it's like small line has not advanced right now and he has not advantage over time because nothing will change, right? Queen-7-deuce, there is not a single turn card I wouldn't like to see. So actually, queen-6-deuce, 3-4-5 kind of sucks, deuce-6, but it's still not about offsuit combos, right? Making straights with 7-8 for the big blind is a very different thing than like the 4-5, he parked, he has it, five, three, okay, yeah, not happening. So yeah, it'd be something like that. And now the way we went through that, what was it, jack, seven, three board, which one would be your first checking hand here? Now trade off boards, we said we're looking pretty much for the weakest hands to check fold for sure, because this is the only mistake we could be doing, which would be betting those i mean my first checking hand that is a check fold or let's say your highest frequency checking hands does is not necessarily a check fold probably jacks okay makes a lot of sense right because just equity denying etc but with what we've learned today pio would show you like 30 40 percent betting frequency because actually getting a bet in with jacks is not a big deal right so actually what we are doing here is really look like looking at those check faults right because again with hands that are ready to build a little of a pot like we always have all options in general but those that really need to get out of the way there they have only one option and this is what PIO will reflect and show us that's really those that are not ready to invest a single penny. Jack seven suited. Right like probably jack four is even worse because just the seven has an overcard to the six is worth more than the backdoor and obviously you have to say jack seven of hearts because the backdoor flush draw would kill it right so i mean that's obvious um but this would be the pattern right another high checking frequency hand would be for different reasons again but but would be ace-eight. Because that would be like the threshold ace where still weaker aces check down. Or like maybe it's even ace-nine, right? Where like ace-eight, ace-seven for a villain always checks down. Ace-three, four, five with the backdoor straight starts bluffing a little. And something like that can be a thing as well. That is like eight of hearts would be ace nine of hearts would be something that would assume with very high checking frequency i'd be right back yep um i'll just keep going without fear so um yeah i chose to bet here even close to range even on that queen six deuce he checks and now on the turn i have to evaluate hey what happens on that eight right it's like okay i expected that on the flop that not too much is changing overall and obviously the eight is a card where not too much is changing we both improve two set of eights with those wide ranges that does not matter too much queen it off i think we have it both a little um but maybe the small bank never and the big blind just sometimes yeah like i think it's it's a high frequency three bet hand actually i have that in mind but um yeah now we both uh improve to some draws right i've checked 10 i've checked nine villain should float that with the backdoor draw as well so even now talking about nut equity over time it's like there is something once we bet jack 10 jack 9 9 10 he will probably fold those hands so there are some river cards where i will be the only one having the nuts which is always a reason to polarize we could for example overbet our kings here we could overbet our pocket deuces if we want to um yeah i was just talking about the turn card in general. And now, what would you do with your pocket aces, Fedor? Or what do you think, what would Pio do with pocket aces? I think this is one of the boards where I would assume that there, again, it goes a bit into check. Like, it must be splitting I given that big blind could now what was the flop sizing pot a little small small and he raises oh no okay it's it's uh 1k it's a 1k now moving up um so I I would think now that he could coordinate his range more towards the the board I would think that the small blind now goes into a mix between checking and betting again and that there's going to be large bets in there. With large bets, I mean over bets as well. Yep. So I think probably like definitely some of all kinds of bets i would think that it's mixing through but uh i would probably gut feeling would be around um half ish continuing like betting and half ish checking and then mixing between different sizings and definitely having an overbet size with a decent frequency okay yeah. Yeah. I'm not entirely sure. I did not look that specific board up now, but yeah, it's pretty true. So we have that. Well, we have nut advantage right now because villain would raise his deuces and sixes on the flop mainly and queen six suited. The eight does not really bring too many new nuts there, right? Big black might have a little queen eight off, but our kings are still pretty, pretty strong here. So actually an overbet is a thing as Thank you. bring too many new nuts there right big blind might have a little queen eight off but our kings are still pretty pretty strong here so actually an over bet is a thing as well because what i said like nuts over time right there will be situations where the small blind can have the nuts and the big blind not which will be all in on the on the river right i don't care about my stack size if that river is a 10 and i have a jack 9 i can have a i can have a range that goes all in right um so we have that sizing and another one like the normal sizing that both most people use is like often the least effective actually because then the right answer would just be to call like whatever has something and maybe call down queen x which big blind has plenty of right again here a small sizing um can be pretty cool you can still value that your a6 for for example or your king six even better right and then have like that 30 sizing to force villain to continue with like partly his ace highs or his random floats from the flop what is i mean random king jack king 10 he has all that offsuit stuff so again having that small sizing as a tool to attack villain's range is pretty great actually that board is mainly a checking board though after betting range and villain could already throw his weakest part away well overall we just have so many hands that want to go to showdown a little bit deuce x 6x 8x weak queen x all the peers in the middle all those ace jack ace king ace 10 ace 9 ace 7 type of hands we're okay i was talking about the lookalike principle and actually if we look that up in pi with those pocket aces are 100 check right for that reason right villain should build lots of ranges that are attacking ace highs because we have lots of ace highs. So aces are 100% check. For that reason, villain should build lots of ranges that are attacking ace highs because we have lots of ace highs. So aces having a checking range in the spot like that is pretty cool. It's what I did. The three does not change. It might have four or five. He might raise it on the flop. He might bet it on the turn turn so how many of those are left i don't care too much and well i still just play my aces like my ace x and know right away okay i'm kind of balanced but it's not like that i have so many aces like i have ace x but still having that pattern and doing that with other hands i feel like i would always value bet my king six not necessarily my ace six i just for for those kinds of reasons that i keep like the kind of same categories um in in there and well once he decides to take like such a chickeny um bat size on the river i'm obviously check raising here um and yeah this i don't care about that hand right it? It's like not about like choosing that right, perfect bet size, not like guessing what he might call, whatever, I'm building my ranges in a way that makes sense and I can use Pio to learn from that. Okay, so these were the first two and now coming to the, I wanted to put that in the second screen which is not working, but yeah. Reaction game. There's a little typo. Oops. Range check boards, trade-off boards. And again, when we think about the whole strategy, we can put, we can split up those trade-off boards and treat them sometimes as a range check or like the same way like we play the range check boards and we can play them like the range bet boards like we did on the queen six twos for example and yeah this is mainly the case those boards where we might still have an advantage now but probably not a big one right maybe there's a straight even right there but we clearly have a disadvantage over time. Big blind has position. This is the boards we are talking about, right? This was why queen six deuce, even with the trade-off could fall into that a little with those three, four, five, deuce six options that might get there on the turn. I just called it your reverse check raising strategy. That would be something we need to look into where it's more about denying equity and actually just um well preparing a different kind of range right if i talk about like a 653 was one example for the range check before that won't be built around all the seven eights and nine eights and uh seven nines and whatever four fives because actually what are we doing as the small blind is we are looking for the cards that are overall good for us which will be a jack a 10 a queen a king where villain won't that villain won't help at all right we are looking for those cards where villain will not use his cannot use his advantage of having more 3x 4x 5x 6x etc um so that would be something look into. That is a lot about denying equity. We're like on 6, 5, 3, first 10, we are probably often check-raising our pocket sevens and pocket eights, clearly not with the goal of going directional and just for other reasons. So it's kind of a different thing than what we talked about last time. And again, I'm using a lot of the lookalike principle, right? set looks like a mid peer an over peer aces looks like an ace uh like an ace high bottom pair etc so i prepared like two hands that maybe fit a little into that category um and let's just see it's very easy simple hands i didn't choose like choose like those crazy with stuff because it's just really about that pattern of thinking. What is there? What can I work on next? That is the goal. So ace four off. You've learned that ace three and ace twos are false for me. So we're really bottom ace high here. This is what I would consider a very, very clear range check board, right? We have not disadvantaged right now, even. We have not disadvantaged over time for sure. So yeah, we're definitely checking range. And then it's the reaction game, right? I cannot tell you what to check race as long as I don't know whether he's betting pot or he's betting a third pot or he's betting three times the pot. I don't know. For that, I have a clear check call here with ace four. I won't have a donk on that three, even though maybe it might make some sense because it's a card that doesn't help him. And I river the four. We're like, okay, here, what I know right away is again, lookalike principle. i will know this is the four i'm definitely putting into my check raising range and not necessarily because it's the it's the strongest four but it's just well that helps obviously as well but i would always bet my queen for for example right because what am i floating i'm floating like queen jack of hearts by check calling the flop i want to bluff those right i want to use that lookalike a little just like one small routine you can implement there to really stay balanced in all that mixing things i didn't look that one up but i'm pretty sure it's lots of check uh check raises on the river so um freaking hot always coming up and the very last hand before wrapping it up is again flopping it and here well what would you consider is that type of board fedor i mean i remember when you talked about the nine five deuce i mean obviously that's a bit different than nine seven des, but still lots of hands with equity on this type of board. I did think that it was a range check, but I would have put it in a category of a mixed, some trade-off board, but yeah, maybe I'm wrong. Yeah, no, it's definitely a trade-off board where, well, lots of people would put it in the range bet, first of all well villain doesn't have anything but it's just so easy for him to react right any five six seven eight nine ten jack is not necessarily great for us so um it's actually one of the boards where in position we use over bets um and uh yeah when we are deeper just like mac to maximum charging his nine x um when we have something like pocket tens, right? Keeping equity with something like jack 10 or queen 10, just using the two over cards. I didn't want to put a gut shot in there. So actually what happens here, this is a very high check raise frequency board. And both players have high incentive to be betting because folding out equity is a big deal on that board. We're okay, right? This is, we start off with a trade off. I can run the randomizer and what we've learned today i really if i don't find anything i don't give a shit whether it's 30 or 70 that would really be way too much to try and learn that um well obviously nines are maybe a little more check and sevens a little more bet but for now i don't care. And then again, I can randomize whether it's a check raise or a check call where, hey, against half pot, yeah, it is a mix again in Pio, but I just like to know my ranges and I play with my sevens a little like my seven X. My check raise range is more around pocket jacks, pocket tens, ace nine, stuff like that. Because well, which turn card can hurt me actually? And that sevens, one last thing I want to get I'll see you next time. pocket jacks pocket tens ace nine stuff like that um because well which turn card can hurt me actually and that's sevens one last thing i want to i want i want to uh get out there for sure it's whenever we are raising or betting it's about two things it's like before like or like in old times we said bluffs and value bets or you even said we want to get called by worse and we want to fold out better which, kind of the example from last week with the check raise is not the full story. It's like it's as well about how much better are we or how much do we fold out? Like how much better do we fold out? So it's really about when we are betting or raising, it's about getting called by hands that have that we have equity against right which puts our bluffs into there when villain is calling with a nine here my jack 10 is a great check race obviously right and even my king queen would be an okay check race and the other side would be we want to fold out hands that have equity against our range right whether i fold out four or five on ace king queen great i don't care right um when i fold out i don't know what here uh that's pretty great in all cases right so it's really those two things where i say like okay what happens here obviously if i check raise i get called by hands that are clearly worse than mine right that i have a lot of equity against. But if I check raise, what do I fold out? Mainly hands that have 0% equity against me. So it's not that clear. Betting or check raising, if we check here with pocket tens and villain bets, Pi will show you 100% check raise. And this is the reason, because you get called by lots of hands that do not have much equity against your tens plus you fold out hands that have quite a lot of equity against your hand so um really think about those two things and here i decide okay it's a mix one thing of the bet is cool another thing of the race is not cool so i'm actually this time i was just check calling i obviously bink it again kind of hope he has a nine and what i do here i don't need to check raise my boat, which some recreationals are doing. And I'm just playing it like a seven X and you can know right away. I have no trouble finding bluffs here now. Not at all. Right. Because I can play with my kind of lookalike principle and yeah, obviously showing those hands. I cooler someone again. But this is not what it's about. It's really about... Exactly what it's about. And yeah, $1,000 in my pocket. Last part of the lesson, guys. If you want to win at poker, you got to have the better hand. That's very good. When it goes in, when you don't have the better hand, better make him fold. Okay. Yeah, that would be it for today uh and yeah was it was a pleasure again guys i hope you enjoyed it a little and have again what i set as my session goal is now when you think about working on blind versus blind or just put yourself in fedor's shoes who gets the linus exam in two days and has 12 hours to work at i want you to know what you spend that time with doing right that's the main thing you know if you want to work on it that's all up to you uh feel free and be a recreational but i guess we are not the right group for that so um yeah just just know what you're working at do the right things tackle that and really think about it in which way you're doing that. I want to summarize some things, definitely my takeaway. So one of the first things to look at, I think, is to become really flexible with understanding which factors flow into your final strategy. so round positions, ranges, stack depth, which then all of these things that we talked about come out of. So not distribution and all the according strategies and equity distribution, all this is a result of different ranges and positions and stack depth. And following up that i i think what's what i really took away here is um i mean i realized as well as like hey wow okay it's a new scenario but if i get into it if i if i get a bit more comfortable with it then i start to understand and i saw more of the logics that stefan is more familiar with because he plays these scenarios more often and I would encourage every tournament player because I know most of you play tournaments to approach your game that way too is to look at the spots where you have the most potential for growth the most potential to improve and try to work on them and try to look at okay how can you structure and that's the second thing I really want to highlight, what I loved in Stefan's presentation, is to structure by strategy. Not just structure by, okay, how do I play an ace high flop and then you have 100 different flops and you don't really know the logic, but to really look at, okay, which boards do I c-bet with what type of strategy? And then try to reverse engineer the logic. It's like, okay, these are the different reasons why. And then you can apply that in-game much more easily. And you can simplify your strategy to a degree where I think you will become better a lot faster. So this part, sorting by strategy, I really, really liked. And then after that, I think what's going to be super important is to to understand how things shift so to really understand the logic of um to to repetitively be able to apply that over and over again is okay now this turn card is in favor like this is what it changes now there's more combinations of this like let's say he has more nuts or it's better for you. And then to think about, okay, on this type of card, it doesn't really make sense to have a 75% bet because this is how the range is structured. And boom, now you immediately can say, now you create the logic in your mind automatically based on all the things you've learned in the past. And yeah, that's what I take away from it. And it inspired me to look at uh some more blind versus blind spots but probably with anti and 30 big blinds deep then you can see that 10 six of diamonds exactly then i'm gonna see where my double back to our straight draw um but yeah for sure um stefan i mean i i think this is always mind-blowing I hope it was super valuable for you guys too. You can rewatch it on the platform. I think every one of you knows about that. So now the last thing to do, I think, is thank our man, the goose, for this absolute value bomb, Stefan. I mean, you know, we love you. Thanks a lot for your time and the beautiful content so hope enjoy your Sunday and good luck let's see aren't you a Thomas Tuchel fan? yeah I am but today I'm like I'm it hurts a little on the one side but it's like the one day in a year I guess like the semif-finals i was not sure whether i'm rooting for leon but now it's a clear thing all right good luck uh tonight i think it worked out actually last last sunday i got some like stuff in the success channel so i want to see some more titles here some big final table appearances are fine as well but i mean you know like it's not about the money we want to have those trophies fuck icm and uh i want to i want to see that and be part of it so uh good luck to get those shiny bracelets uh at everyone who's trying 25k today gonna win it okay that's for you fedor cheers guys bye bye guys bye bye
