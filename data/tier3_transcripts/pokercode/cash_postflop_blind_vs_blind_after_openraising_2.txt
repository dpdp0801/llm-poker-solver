### TOPIC: cash postflop blind vs blind after openraising 2
 blind versus blind as you might already know that this topic is way way way way way too big for one session so i'll focus on like some easy thoughts regarding that as always for the public coaching i try to keep things a little more simple than in the member only coachings because well it's for a broader audience so if you're just around here to learn something about blind versus blind i still want you to take something away if you're already a very solid rag who is maybe a poker code member or hopefully i already produced some add-ons talking a little deeper about stuff and i will do so as well on the coaching but it's always like a little stretch to to make it good for everybody but i think we got something in for everybody today so is this for cash game or tournament mostly or just fundamental again as always especially the public coaching all the examples are cash game examples but everything I will present today works the same way so actually yeah I took a couple of things from private coachings and private coaching, I helped recently with some good stuff coming up, some great ideas and thoughts. So this was actually a tournament player. So this works out for everybody. It actually works out for 100 big blinds, for 40 big blinds, what I will present today. When we get very, very specific with hand examples, I will use cash examples though. I'm just, this is on the very other side here, that chat I work, how can I pull that somewhere else? Chat like this, no, chat, chat, chat, no. No, no, how tough it can be to put the chat somewhere else. Seems just impossible. Okay, anyways, I feel like there was actually, let me, I just opened Twitch and read it there. I'm too bad with that. Sorry for that. All right, so one minute past five, time to go, I would say. And yeah, as always always i try to follow the chat all questions are welcome this is here for beginners for intermediate players for for pros for everything i'll try and find words to answer your questions no question is stupid and yeah so so just feel free to reach out and then we'll jump into the spot blind. Blind versus blind. I don't have a better headline, to be honest, for what I'm talking about today. Because actually it's wide range of spots and how I see those in general. So you can take lots of that for the small blind, how we should play it for the big blind. It works for button versus big blind as well in a way i will talk about very exploitative thoughts about pool tendencies that are just known about how people play naturally and how we make use of that instead of just following the solver blindly and then we obviously will use some solver output for the examples as well but using our own brain even more to make sure we understand where EV is coming from in the end. So yeah this is the timeline for today. I'll quickly explain the spot which should be quite easy and then I'll talk... I try, I'm always bad with that. I always say I try to do it quickly and then it's 45 minutes gone but we'll talk about game plan in that spot about how i use simplification and this will be more of a recap so if you guys are already poker code members you know that we have plenty of videos regarding blind versus blind there was like one of the i don't know highlight is the wrong word but one of the big big big lessons that i try to to teach that are very important because it's not just blind versus blind it's it's it's about just how do we navigate through wide ranges and how should we think and like well everything after that gets easier so I could spend probably 50 hours on that we have one today and yeah and yeah truth about population is the next thing so I wanted to call it like that because I want you to treat it like that. This is coming right from my thought process that we think about what are villains doing wrong. And there are a couple of things that are just known because it's very, very natural. People who are not absolute pro professionals and even still those have like a natural way of playing to start with lots of those and that deviates from the solvers in a certain way and i will just tell you which one that is and this is something i will mention that more over and over again that you can you can google that people making database analysis and and so on for free on youtube actually i i found a good one lately where someone analyzed an american zoom pool and it's like it's always the same because it's just a natural way of deviating it's not like people are too different there obviously this individual players are very different but the majority plays in like one direction and this is the one that i will really want to treat as if it's just a given thing that will lead to certain exploits that i want to implement in your game plan and this is the goal for today that i leave you with a clear message that you can apply in the next spots you are playing and you know why that is good and will increase your ev in this spot in your games. We'll talk about examples and I put out that word because I kind of like it. We'll talk about small punches, really trying to hurt villains often. We are not trying to knock them out with freaking crazy all-in bluffs today, but we'll put out lots of small punches and make them lose a little here and a little there there that's the plan when it comes to wide ranges and as always i'll leave you with a couple of key takeaways that make you hopefully want to jump into the next and to the next games available and crush your opponents exactly uh yeah a jab never hurt somebody i want to say but didn't shouldn't shouldn't hurt yourself but your opponents a little little hey cold smile good to see you again Thank you. So let's go and Yeah time to start the spot very easy We open race small man first in and villain calls big blind most examples or all the examples are from small blinds perspective But you can treat that vice versa as well, right? You can say villain is open raising small blind and we call in the big blind that works the same way. I just showed you random depending on the rake, right? I just filtered for a non limping strategy with a certain rake. It's like a standard, whatever opening range on the left and a standard calling range on the right. Very, very easy. And just seeing that we have very, very wide for tournament players this is even more interesting and even more important because ranges get wider right if we include limping we get even wider ranges i just talk about 100 big blind with big blind ante lots of limping lots of checking back very very wide ranges so yeah sales almost all wrecks watch you so who will we crush there are plenty of people not watching so yeah it's just 87 right now i think there are there are more like thousands of the of the wrecks so plenty of people plenty of people to crush but good point poker pro nl2 you should move up to nl5 and nl10 soon at least with that information here so this is the spot i hope every everyone is keen about that and then we can jump into the next thing and quickly recap my strategy that i use there my simplifications so i kept the ranges here for the overview the problem we are facing is just small line range here is 578 combos big line range is 490 combos you don't need to know those numbers you just need to know it's a lot right and navigating those and arguing like i have more sets i have more this i have more two pairs i am stronger whatever talking about six combos 10 combos 20 combos won't help you a lot to really understand that spot it's just too big big. We need to to grow our brains, to grow our heads, to make that fit in. So we need to freaking simplify that we really in-depth understand those spots. So the way I do that and the way I did present it in the poker code lessons is always through simplification and through cornerstones. So first thing I wrote, did write down here is I split things up on the flop into a range bet, range check and trade off boards. So it's like boards where we bet everything, our entire range or the majority, some spots where we should everything and and the in-between boards and like a way of thinking on those which helps us to break down the continuations right so next was kind of talking about the double barrels next was to talk about how we play after a check and facing a bet and the late game feeling like really cut things down which is something i can't do today it's way too much for that you should definitely sign up and see all the videos i think all you see there's plenty of work to be to be done lots of hours going in there small examples big examples big sessions lots of theory yeah so weird to look at lots of pictures where it's just like my freaking face looking at myself but yeah it's it's it's fine so yeah blind versus blind is just a very very very big spot and that's it the whole key if you really want to understand things in depth it means you need to break things down make them simple for your brain to have a strategy to have your cornerstones i always want to have those that i know exactly which like which parts of which hand class am i playing which way right i know pretty much in any spot how i play my top set my middle set my bottom set in which way i treat my nut flush draws other flush draws nut flushes and so on how do I do things when there's like a straight that I have offsuit which means lots of combinations this is what I mean with cornerstones just having some kind of navigation because breaking it down to the level where we talk just about combinations is impossible scrolling back up here talking about 500 something it's like my brain is too small probably most other brains are also too small so we try to cluster things to break them down all right give me a second to to catch up with the chat here not too much so i team 578 out of 30 and 26 right so it's like's like really we play 43 44 percent of our hands something like that. And this is this is just a lot Okay, so not a big recap shouldn't help you too much But just showing that it's impossible to really give you a strategy in a couple of words So this is a message to you guys everyone who wants to improve the materials out there the explanations in depth you just gotta sign up and check those out and and then post lots of hands to get them evaluated and yeah that that is if you really want to increase your fundamentals if you're just here to learn some fancy cool stuff and some way of thinking you're here perfectly for free and this is what we are going into now right so next step if i remembered it correctly is the truth about population maybe before just showing that i'll ask you guys what do you think just like in very very general words what is the about population? What are people doing wrong compared to the solver? So as you might know, I'm always thinking with three questions. First, what would be right? This is something we can look up these days. Second, what are villains doing wrong? And third, what is the right exploit? Now I'm asking you, what are people generally doing wrong in this spot talking about wide ranges APZ how does should I call you 23 that's your image so I call it to 23 says overfall to 4-bet okay that's a very specific thing I doubt that actually because people I rather think they are lacking the 3-bet bluffs right check raise too little even more general more general. This is very specific lines So now all right, I showed you there's so much we can talk about we need to break down and so on and you are going At like one little piece one thing is like talking about the four betting one guy talks about the check raising Being too passive not protecting passive lines. All right, if they show weakness, they are weak. That's it, right? So it's like, and they are weak too often, then show us. Population does not defend enough big blind, this specific pre-flop, right? Good, spot that comes. Big blind overfold versus small blind c-bet because ranges are so wide and therefore defending involves weak hands which can feel awkward very good point again breaking it down to just one of the lines but so not general enough for the way i asked the question but very very very right all right so wide ranges this is the key involves playing lots of hands that do not feel great in a three-bet pot sitting there with Jacks tens and ace Kings and so on it feels good we can continue with that well probably even too often for some recreationals because they think like an absolute hand strength a little more than a relative hand strength but right heads up the like the kings of poker crushing heads up they are the best at navigating through spots where well air fights here right winning the nothing versus nothing war gets more and more important the wider the ranges are both players have nothing very very often so this is it ap is ap is good let's go don't defend enough they are nitty whatever exactly nitty means but yes overfolding white spots not enough three bad big again very specific there's nothing wrong everything you say and i read so far i agree to passive falling too much oh hey thanks for the raid mojo poker love it love to see that and welcome everyone if you want to check out a little blind versus blind theory or my personal thoughts here on how to crush, you're in the right place. And I'll just show you two things, right? That just every database shows or like summaries of like pool tendencies show is this year. The player pool overfolds massively in wide range spots. And I'm not talking just about the flop. I'm not talking just about the turn and I'm not talking just about the river. It's the combination of everything. Usually people overfold to triple barrels, to double barrels, to single barrels, to delayed bets, to double delayed bets. All of those usually get over folds on average from the average player. Obviously are some brazilians out there they are not over folding shout out to all my brazilian friends you get one every single coaching so it's that's it right so the second thing is the player pool is not aggressive enough in wide range spots and this is why it's not a tendency this is why i'm presenting something like that usually i hate just taking things as given because i i watched like 2010 2011 i watched poker videos myself and people were saying like oh this works without the because like you these days you need to three bet a lot why well i like didn't help me at all right so i want those videos to stay that they can still help in five years and this is why it's just very very natural right it's tough to navigate when you have nothing it's very natural to throw away your hand when you have nothing whatever nothing might mean in the in the context right when you have king high sometimes it's an an okay hand, right? When you have just an Ace high, when you have a bottom pair with three over cards. Whatever that might mean, right? And the other thing, not aggressive enough, right? Not understanding relative hand strength that actually you have lots of value hands compared to villain maybe and you need to add lots of bluffs. Who has advantage in those spots and so on all right so we end up people not bluffing enough in the first place which means we see cards cheaper than we should is the first thing and the second thing is that if they check they are weaker than they because, well, if they are not betting their bluffs or their ear or whatever, it needs to be somewhere. So it's just like, and this is not like me doing crazy database analysis. This is just that you can find them. Like you can go to all, I don't even want to call them competitors, like everything you find online. If you go to upswing to raise your ad, shout out to all of them to, I don't know, like somehow card competitors like everything you find online if you go to upswing to raise your ad shout out to all Of them to I don't know like somehow card runner CV comes up in my mind Even though that's not really a thing these days, but like whatever if you do you google YouTube all the streamers out there This is something if they do something like that you see over and over again. So I just take that as given information This is how population deviates from GTO as a standard a standard. So now I talked already a little about what does that mean. And I again catch up quickly with the chat. So Adam J. Poker overfolding from big blind, not defending enough, not 3-betting enough. This is just like breaking down the not aggressive enough and the overfolding. Not check-raising enough, maybe missing bottom defense, right? It's all over folding and not raising enough. So dark folds to death stairs. Okay. Yeah, that's it. That's it That's it. Alright lots of nightbots going on here. Why is it nightbots? It's 5 p.m. Okay You know, he's been in the game a lot of times when Karan Zvi comes to my blood Yeah, I wouldn't be here for Ivy League or what was it called? Lego poker. All right. So what does that mean? I already talked a little about that. But to just like break it down, and I'm definitely missing things. We over-realize equity is one thing. Just imagine you bet something. If a queen I board, you bet your king five suited nothing. And you know villain is raising less often than he should. Means you see the turn more often than you should. You will hit a king sometimes, which will give you EV. So this is just immediate profit because of that over-realization. You don't need to throw your hand away. Same thing, you check a board when you have nothing, you see a turn card. Now you might have something with a hand that would have check folded instead. So just over realizing equity because people are too passive in general. All right, the second thing, you get away with immediate EV when bluffing. Take that very simple spot. We check the flop, villain checks back. We check the turn, villain checks back. We bet small on the river. Like no way villain is not over folding as a general thing. And we can have any shit. This is just a spot because he checked, didn't bluff the flop enough, he sits on shit on the turn. He didn't bluff the turn, now he still sits on shit on the river we bet he folds so it's just that thing air versus air is kind of the first bet wins very often and that is something that goes street by street works on every street i just took that very very easy example because there is no further gameplay and another thing you being more aggressive you deny equity effectively It's like, maybe a better example is if we are big blind. Villain checks to you on 7-6-3, you don't give this free card. You bet most of your jack-10 and villain folds his queen-10. So it's just, well, something false. Which is always kind of good, taking down the. All right, so if he's not aggressive enough, shouldn't we overfold? Exactly. Once he does something, we need to fold at some point, right? So this is, yeah, it's like he's not splitting things correctly. One side gets too strong, the other too weak. We want to hammer on the weak spot and be a little cautious when there's strength this is why actually the last thing is why i call the small the small punches we don't want to go into the knockout fights in that spot right if they show lots of strength they are actually stronger than they should be the last slide is key takeaways as always and the last one is avoid the big ones kind of without having it but yes okay so and this is still a big learning that deep into mortar says here right it's really if you have knowledge about one line actually you have knowledge about the other line as well right people get the same hands if they always have it when they are betting it means means something for their checking as well. Very very important. Okay so now let us talk about the exploits. This here is really not my opinion. I want you to treat it as the truth. It's a given thing. Not for every individual player but on average in your pool. If you always do it you end up making money and some Brazilians crush you. But you can figure those out quickly usually. If you see, right, it's like very often you can look up the hands and then you see like, oh, he made that indifferent crazy catcher bluff, bluff catcher on the river. I mean, not crazy, crazy for like a check, check, small jab here. He knows where he's at, right? Then you can maybe mark him. But people being too crazy and calling too much is very, very, very rare. Okay, let's get to the exploitative side. I call the plan of small punches, right? So we want to hammer on that weak part of their range. And to put in not easier words, but to make it very clear, I want to give villain the maximum amount of chances to play incorrect. Now knowing that they play incorrectly by over folding and by not raising especially, we know how we get in there. So what do we need to do? We need to bet. We need to bet that they have a chance to overfold and that we benefit from them not raising if we check we well we benefit from them not betting enough and we can we can punish them in the late game then yes as well but we need to put out those bets when the the right moment has come right so here second thing small bets are the key. When ranges are still wide. If we are talking about triple barrels and everything gets here and we want to represent the world now, this is not what I call a knockout fight. It's like this is not what we want to go for because villain has a tighter range now as well. It's not the, let's say, the overfold he is not realizing. Just like people throwing away when they have nothing, they do not feel the overfold. If someone sits there with the top pair and faces the bet overbet, another overbet, sits there like I want to call this over, I want to call that top pair, I want to call this and so on, that's not the spot. It's really wide ranges where they throw away their first 200 bullshit combinations without even thinking about it. And often parts of those they should bluff raise for example. Okay so now I'm asking you, I mentioned a lot throughout the last 20 minutes already, but just write it down now it's the time for just certain lines you like taking. Which options to apply small bets can you come up with? Give me a list of five of ten of fifteen of 15 lines. Quickly, as quick as you can. Just like, I started with the first one. We could c-bet small on the flop. You don't need to quote me on that, but that would be the first one. Which options to apply small bets in an effective way, in a way that makes sense, can you come up with? Small delayed c-bet. Very easy, right? On a board where villain lots of misses right let's say king eight deuce, well we might range bet but we could check also if you want. Turn is another deuce, villain likely has nothing. We can take our four five and bet and he folds his jack ten, we are all happy. Very easy example, block betting river. So block betting in that sense means it could be anything it could be double barreling and then putting out a block bet it could mean check check and then block betting right doesn't tell us the the action before just for the for the wording here to be clear that everyone gets the same point I think you mean the double delayed bet that means that nothing happened before tiny sizing works the same way but it works after double barreling as well if villain for example has busted draws himself and we have worse than that let's say our four five open ender busted we have five high what could that be queen nine three six and the river is another three right villain queen nine three six three villain will have all combinations of Jack ten and it's enough for us if he folds that and we just put it tiny Like we will see 10% bets stuff like that just to really put out the real small punches out there Anymore like only two people that's that's not enough. Well, I need I need like at least three more More options no, no real wrong answer. So so don't be scared of answering here flop check raise all right so question is actually before i made another slide where there was a list on it but i thought like i skipped that i'll let you do it i put a question mark after the flop check raise because this is in a way attacking strength we say they are not aggressive enough so their betting range is stronger than it should be therefore check raising on some boards is still good on some maybe not so we need maybe want to even be a little more value heavy but this is very very specific given villain sizing given the board structure but it's a way to attack things right we race we deny equity they fold all good small check race clickbacks things getting crazy right but it already triggers click back that villain did something which usually is a little stronger than it should be mumbo jungle another one will be one of our examples double barrel small beautiful spot there are spots lots of people are not having that in their arsenal where a small second barrel makes sense. I played a live play this morning focusing on those wide range of spots. I play a hand. I loved it I ran into a top pair calling me down, but I went 27% flop, 27% turn, 27% river with a busted full bullshit but I loved it and like I looked up the hand in the review and seeing how he should answer my line was just like impossible for him, like freaking impossible. He needed to raise so much and call down so much where like I was sure I made a lot of money in that one. As big line doubles, small bear mostly work against under under ager players? Under age player? Under, I got it, under aggressive players but versus underage players maybe not that much because they are usually a little more aggressive playing with their parents money but yeah the the under aggressive players works perfectly. cbet the turn small is out of position, we got that. River probe after they went bet check check again with bet check bet line villain by checking back the turn is capped maybe sits on draws he wants to realize equity he sits still on jack high we bet the river he folds triple barrel small we got it so muggy w crushing here loving that okay so lots of lines and now this is pretty much the whole message for today's session the small punches and giving you examples for that I think and I always am always guessing even though I made the presentation today that what the next slide is I think the next one is already coming to examples and I hope I don't scare you away with a little paint I made that was too big to make on the. So I prepared it for you guys, the little game tree. Right. So I hope you see that well. And it's, it's just the flop game plan of blind versus blind to just see all the options we're having. I explain it quickly, right? We started as the small blind. Let's say small blind is zero. This looks like an exam question for electrical engineers. Yeah, nice. I felt the same. So what can we do? can check big blind turns over checks back and that leads us to an opportunity this is how i want to see it an option villain is now very likely or an average more full of shit than he should be which means we have the small blinds option of the delayed bet. Beautiful option right. What could happen as well is we check, big blind decides to bet. Well if you fold it's over, not shit, but if we call there are some turns that we can donk bet and some turns that we should donk bet. We could obviously check raise and this is a little tougher now right this is not really wide range anymore after villain called a check raise on the flop he did bet himself he did call the check raise that is usually a little larger in those spots and then we see a turn it's this is not really our spot but obviously it's an option as well maybe we see a nice card that helps us, or just hurts him. Just saying we have E here anyways. Or we are re-raising now saying this is too crazy, I'm not following up here. Obviously it exists but I'm not going into that for any examples. Cool, what else could we do? We can obviously start by betting and this here is too small, this is already a simplified game tree. Obviously we can have multiple bet, but we could be betting and Then villain folds and we know already they are over folding. So we make money right away by betting they can call which means they are weak They did not race great great information. They call they did not race which means we cannot double barrel depending on the turn card Depending our hand with small sizes, crazy sizes or other stuff. Or they raise us in which we mainly should overfold given the truth about population or we can call and this is now a wild one, right? Donk after calling raise. So the clearest ones we want to go for is the delayed bet fits our session today is an awesome, awesome, awesome small punch. The donk bet executed in the right way is an awesome punch as well the double barrel the small double barrel fits our strategy of the small punches as well so i hope that it's clear and there's more coming up right the double delayed and then the the well turn let's say check check turn check again villain that small beautiful check raise spot just knowing he didn't show strength so far one small bet we can go crazy in a spot where we can represent something we can it's not only that i i talk you into bluffing a lot i feel like but once we have the knowledge we can go very thinly for value as well so that's very good also just making use of villain showing hand in a way. Alright, and there's obviously way, way, way, way, way, way more, but I can't like it really looks too crazy and scares people off if I go all the way to the river here. Okay, that's it actually and now we'll get just to examples because we didn't talk about hands so far and I want you to show just, I want to show some things, okay? Maybe check out Excalibur. I know that there's stuff like that. They tried to force me to doing that in uni. I don't remember the program we had uni that looks way better. It could be great for your coachings. Yeah, I'm somehow stuck with, yeah, I'm an old man now. I can't do anything new. But actually, no, I write i write it down for you i write it down with a pen and a paper on a little uh okay you see that giraffe and elephant drawing here i got or did with my son no looks beautiful uh so x caligro i will check it out i promise cali draw cool and um so we'll go into GTO wizard tendencies are the same for RFI and lip in yes the tendencies are the same whenever it's wide ranges and whenever people have to play shitheads it's the same for heads up poker It's the same for button versus big blind. It's yeah, just people do not play enough shithands. And they are not aggressive enough with shithands and they just fold shithands. So let's get to the examples. And I just took four examples out of those four boxes, right? So maybe Maybe we have plenty of time still. First come, first serve. Who... four examples out of those four boxes right so maybe we have plenty of time still first come first serve who has a great spot for lots of delayed bets where you think people are not delayed betting a lot or even better where you think people over fold like crazy just to the late bet spot you can say it tell like I just need a board four cards four cards for the delayed bet first come first serve i take the first board analyze it for you and then present my example not saying that mine is better it's just the one depends a lot on on whether it's high or low so i i really want to see four cards so we get the deuce deuce three ace I start with rainbow is the first first of all double-check the flop stretch do we get there should we check yes we should check what should villain do he should bet a lot right beautiful board I'm loving it should do lots of betting, like 50% big bet with the Jack-6 suiteds. 50% big bet with the Queen-9 offsuits. I... no. I doubt it. I doubt it. So check, check, and then ace obviously just being a good card for out of position lots of small bets we got the nine eight offsuit the ten eight offsuit the nine seven the ten and so on and so on and now let's have a look villain should obviously overfold versus is that an overfall that's not really an overfold versus the small bet i expected it to be a little overfold but it's not even that they should call queen 10 50 percent of the time and every king high i think they overfold those Thanks for watching! It's not even that they should call queen 10 50% of the time in every king high. I think they overfold those hand classes. But the main point is that they are not bluffing enough on the flop, which means they have all that stuff more often than they should. And they obviously fold it. They look up their 8-9. They check back on the flop. They fold it on the turn. They on the turn they played perfectly still they did over fold so yeah i show you actually mine was not too not too different i have them written down so i could prove i hope i don't need to but mine is 10 deuce deuce and turn is not an ace that makes things too simple is another 10. 10 deuce deuce goes check check and the spot where we can block bet is high as much as we want. We can block bet a lot and a villain sits there. Kind of the same thing sits there with lots of bullshit. First, our block betting strategy. Villain's reaction. And now, again, two things. Why is that so effective? Because they have the hands that they are forced to fold too often i mean you see they sometimes need to call nine five here not happening they fold nine five so one thing is they have those folding hands too often because they did not bluff the flop secondly they over fold those hands too often i don't think that on most stakes and even the highest stakes, people call their jack-8 off-suit here. They fold it. And the second thing, two reasons for that natural leak. And the third one, can someone tell me the third one? Third reason why we get them to overfold. Why we make a lot of immediate EV here when we let's say the delayed bet our 5-6. They will bet more 10x on flop. Okay, they have something they bet, a good one, actually very good one. So then I'm thinking about a number 4. Or... BALLS Bauchgefühl. Number four is the one that they miss their bluff raises. So they are not only just having that jack three, but they fold it every time instead of ever raising that. A block bet on this board, you need to bluff an absolute. There is no is no equity bluff no no draw no nothing you need to go with an absolute insane air ball to bluff and versus a block bet here bluffing jack three is kind of advanced so they're not raising enough here we go shredder right because of the hand class they need to raise they're just lacking that so the Queen nine race, okay. I mean, sure. What the fuck? It's very, very, very advanced, right? Because it's like I chose a board where lots of hands are shit, right? Wide range versus right range and all the hands you have feel shit. And this is where people overfold the most. So I expect more than 45% folds here, to be honest. a good line and that makes a lot of money a lot lot lot of money okay i won't like how these bluffing hands are chosen anything is good i love you can range block bet if you want if you have nothing you block you win i may be checking the i actually bet for value and equity to my a size they benefit from the same thing that villain does not that he folds jack three instead of instead of raising it and I'm probably checking most King eyes that's like the one face up thing and the or how these bluffing hands are chosen for the race in position. Well good question very very good question I Have no clue. I think it seems rather random right if you take all of those Pretty random maybe blocking off suit 10x makes sense This is why Queen Jack Queen 9 Jack 9 are interesting to block 10 9 off suit Jack 10 off suit and so on a little better than like a random four six suited but even the four six suited is not wrong okay so first example done i'll give you or actually let's double check one more you set the eight seven six five i don't think so because it's actually a good one for in position with the one card straight and you want to go for the low 8-7-6-5 I don't think so because it's actually a good one for in position with the one card straight and you want to go for the low 8-7-6 definitely a board that goes check check a lot so first of all our small blind strategy on 8-7-6 lots of checking I call that a range check board not a single hand really wants to do betting big blind should do a lot on that board even big blind are doing a lot but are they betting like that amount of ace jacks are they betting enough of their a6 or just check back all the time and so on and so on so on that five still like good for imposition i would say even after checking back yeah but probably it works well i i i'm. Like does it work well in reality? Maybe. Maybe. Tough one. Not my first choice example, but it might work. Right, so let's have a quick look. What does villain need to defend? They don't need to raise a lot versus the small bet. That's bad because that kills kind of the one advantage we are having and the continuations are we need them to fold something they have less of that air obviously they fold king queen king jack queen jack but they either have an eight a seven a six a five a nine or a four so it's not one of those spots where people have lots of nothing and just auto fold that so it's not my favorite spot I can see it work. But yeah, I wouldn't take that as a great example Okay Chevy it's good things to think about that But I think it's too deep for that one to really go into detail now which blocker effects small raising because we have seen it's a wild mix of things So the answer for me on that level is it doesn't matter too much regarding the raising on the 10 10 10 deuce deuce 10 right it was a mix of queen 9 queen 10 jack 9 broadway where your argument makes a lot of sense that it unblocks the hands the villain is bluffing and it blocks hopefully the the 10x but we have seen that 6 4 was also an an okay raise. So it's, I think, a random choice and more frequency thing, because anything you raise and you get called does not have much equity, or cannot hit anything that you can value bet. If you hit your peer, you will still check back, I think. Yes, 6-5-4-3 would be better, just for less hits of villain. That that makes sense that he has more 10-9 Jack 9 Jack 10 This is what we want to attack a lot way way way way way more snap folds a good point here muggy W This works way better. Okay, let's go to the next one Can anybody come up with a spot for a turn donk bet? So we check call the flop and we want to donk the turn I need four cards guys first four cards get the spot for the analysis. Nine seven six eight you want to donk. It's good. I don't need to change too much for that. Nine seven six. Oh, we need to check call check I go with half pot Or I take the highest frequency sizing I think that's more fear than just choosing My in between all right, let's take this small one highest but we can check out the higher bigger one as well 976 turn 8 I doubt it Nope, nope, not the one. We can try the big size call but big size also has lots of 10x I think so shouldn't be enough of a equity shift. Not really. So this one did not work out. 9,748. Kind of same thing. Now in position improves a lot here. Do do 7 10 King. Let's have a look This 7 10 King check on the 10 7 news. Let's first check the sizing that should be used Again a mix. All right, we can take it's take half pot this time Call and then we get King obviously improves straight straight draws improves to the king 100% check damn it too much positional advantage if you blow up the pot and he has all the draws very good river play for the big for the big blind that's a problem a problem and doesn't want us to we rather take more check checks than a small donk that really doesn't benefit us. Ace on the turn. Well, we have more ace-ex, but usually the ace doesn't need to deny any equity. So if villain starts bluffing with 10-9 and there's an ace on the turn, we have the better hand often, but we don't even need to fold out anything. So yeah, that's not the one. Queen, Jack, seven, 10 is interesting because it's so special. Queen, Jack, seven. I think this is a big bad board. In position should only bet big because it's a board that small blind can almost range bet. If he checks, it means already something. He's like medium strong. So actually we see the overbet here. So very face up. And 10 might actually be a good one. I like that I mean villain can have obviously King nine Maybe maybe we find one 31% winner so far Queen Jack 7 10 because it's so special in the combination with the overbet on the flop The ace on the turn is not too often one flush draw Board and turn bring another out for flush and that pier the board. I doubt it. I do not really think so Do you think it is a bit different because we have 10-6 and big blind doesn't That's talking about one combination or 12 offsuit come 10-6 off who has 10 10-6 offsuit? I don't know in which world you are right now. But talking about one hand in a 580 combo range doesn't make sense. So this is why I stopped right here. That's the wrong way of thinking in that spot. Classic middle card peering. So 7x on turn. We got a winner. a winner so okay did someone scroll back and and see my my paper aces smart just freaking put down the seven four four four I'm hiding the next two now can you read that seven four four four yeah so this is already good one the middle card actually we can check the jack is obviously a good one but not the one where i would say wide range versus wide range right here the overbet makes it very very special and the middle card is more like attacking now already everything right let's see how that plays out We'll see quite some over bets now as well all right so 150 this big bet here stuff like that just playing that jack and then hammering on a queen right that's not like that why like it's a beautiful spot where we need to find the dog if villain over bets we check call turn we get more trips with the main hand we are having like jack x we need to do action so this is this is kind of an obvious one that well good that you come up with it but doesn't really fit my spot but this here is the beautiful one the seven four it can obviously be any trips that turn any any paired board that turns to trips where villain should start betting big a lot because he has the trip advantage and grabs a lot of trips plus the straight draws this is why i chose something with straight draw straight draws bet all the forex not much trapping going on here add all the straight draws lots of that stuff like all the 10-6 suiteds and so on and then it's it's not the overbet but a big bet, lots of pressure, and then just the turn card says, sir, you represented a hell of a lot of 4x. We cut that in half. Like, actually, you don't have that, and you're full of shit, and on top, we decrease the value of all your straight draws because hitting a straight on the 3-4 board doesn't help you at all. And this is what we see. I think it's even more like like that than than the jack turn okay first thing seven four four ace but then seven four four four came up because of op advantage yes that's it right and the killing of the straight draws and now we can sit here with a freaking ace high and fold out the equity that villain has with like a six eight but that's freaking 10 outs against our ace high so this is beautiful beautiful usage of villain is full of shit and he can't do anything that's a 20% bet and he needs to fold let's see 31% while already calling any jack high raising jack 9 so I bet more like 50 folding exactly ff50 and that's it yeah it's they are representing trips and the board says we cut them down in half and the next better next best thing after trips is well the over peers that are mainly playing check call here or just the the sheer amount of like backdoor draws that he did. So he has just lots of eight highs and nine highs and not six highs but like stuff like that. So we can bluff more. Yeah, I mean we can't bet more than 100%. It's not really bluff because we are not check calling much here, but it's equity denial right it's just you see the v of ace nine betting small is a 6.84 and checking a 6.47 giving away that free free equity is shit that's the hundred percent on here we go okay that's a beautiful one i hope the 7444 so no prices on here but but big shout out to who was it again with the 7-4-4-4? Something with ace, I remember, where I don't find it right now. Just need to scroll too much. Ace is marked, here we go. So, great one. And now, let's get to the next spot. Put it into the check-raise flop. I go for it because there are some boards that people are stabbing, it's fine to stab, but then really tough to defend. It's one of my favorite boards. I think we did have it in our check-raising. It's actually, well, it's my favorite board. I mentioned button versus big blind a couple of times. We had it in our blind versus blind check-raise session. It's always out there, so maybe you can guess it. It's the check-raise flop and continuation on the turn where we get a good turn card and can just freaking blast Do you steal 100% donk against passive fish? Absolutely. Absolutely. They can't do anything. They just don't have the hands I'm probably over folding the flop against this type of player and Then I'm already with a quite a strong range on the turn because it's about the equity denial I want them to do I don't know what I don't care okay let's let's first one that gives me three cards are good for now because we started with the check raise and then we decided for a turn card three cards are good for the for I think a good check raise spot high low low paireddeuce. Queen-four-deuce. Yeah, I mean it's fine. It's kind of random. Jeroen knows me, so here we go, my favorite board. Nine-five-deuce-rainbow. The one where villain has nothing and we have it all, right? No offsuit two pairs for villain. And that just makes our overpairs nuts. right? So that's, that's kind of, that's the reason why this is the board where we want to get maximum amount of money in the middle now, Willem has some pocket nines, some he is three betting. He has pocket fives and deuces and that's it. And then he has the suited combinations of two pairs. So we can stack off pocket tens here or like solver wise, which means we can try to get the maximum money in the middle before there is lots of connectivity going on so here we can look it up tens jacks queens kings our main interest i would say maybe some ace nine is mixing it wants to get a bit big pot and tries to achieve that by betting big or by check raising ace queen nine is awesome as well but here i clearly prefer the big bet ourselves compared to the check raise because Willems stabbing frequency should be way lower. Here it's very natural that people are betting sometimes because they have 9x, they have 5x, they want to protect, plus they have the straight connectivity. For them it seems like they have something but they are not backing that up with nuts really. So checking villain betting let's go with like half pot or something like a little little here a little there let's say what's the highest half pot even highest frequency and then we see something beautiful on that not in this one i had another sim where it shows the 150 percent check raise sizing because it clearly showed going for the maximum amount of money in the middle right now all right so let's take this year now the check raises with the over cards plus backdoor and now you can you can guess the best turn card anyone the best turn card after check raising here 10 i'm not sure i i just randomly i didn't look it up i went with a jack but it's it's one of those has to be one of those Let's take your ten Maybe yeah, let's take ten should be the same Ten is better. It wasn't 95% betting on a jack so you win awesome the ten and this is Something where we can do lots of damage, right? Everything improves to either a straight draw or a top here and still our ace 9 is good enough to rather stack off here at that point because we did fold out everything, right? So comparing that to the other boards you sent me is that here I created a situation where villain has a wide range, starts stabbing a lot but pretty much never has anything right against the big check raise size he has maximum a gut shot like an or a nine or a five and he hates life and then once there is another high card he's absolutely crushed right while the what was the the other example king nine five with a flush draw he has lots of things right and like against the king we don't have that much equity because it's ace is the only only over card so we need to be more selective with a flush draw he has lots of cards to navigate and so on double broadway low low is already has such a big advantage for us that i rather prefer betting than checking all right against our check villain't bet that often. Let's quickly look at that. Let's finish that one off here. 10-7. Not 10-7, 10-9. 5 deuce now and river whatever. Oops sorry. Put another deuce out there. So all our straight draw busts but it shouldn't matter too much. Yeah, Badugi makes it so like four, like rainbow makes it better. That villain has nothing to navigate. He follows up with backdoor flush draws on the flop. On the turn, they are all shit. So he has the maximum amount of nothing, right? So 55% jamming here on that river. Ace-9, just not enough. But if we do something crazy like this here, then see you later. See you later, big blind are right so now even on the queen we can we can we can block bit our ace nine for value now the other one i think it was just better to to check call we're not folding ace nine anywhere but what did i try to show on double broadway low low i want to show that something like king queen deuce double broadway low low is four cards now i'm confused but if you were just talking about a double broadway board obviously we have a massive advantage here but i prefer betting it's like yes there's some there's lots of checking actually but i prefer betting because against that check there is not that much betting going on At the like 70% check back I don't get the chance for lots of check raises and that means well I lose some leverage losing a straight. Just about the river. Got it. Okay. And with the river juice in in lesson The river deuce just means we have lots of Lots of cards, lots of hands That bust, no new nuts King, queen, queen, jack, king, jack, it all bust We could bet the turn so often Because we have that additional equity with overcards And if nothing of that hits, that's why it's not that great it's still a good card jamming 55 is solid okay so that was a good example for the check race because again we created a scenario where villain ends up having lots of snap folds not even thinking about it right now having the question as always when it comes to check raising that we need villain to bet that first right so So I'm showing that again. 9-5-2s. Why do I need to always put that in here? So we need villain to bet that first right so i'm showing that again nine five deuce why do i need to always put that in here so we need villain to bet the stuff that he can then fold so it's good for us if he bets jack ten because this is something he will fold if he bets i don't know his king seven bluff is good if it is there we check raise our jack ten he's out of there right so it's it's kind of not good for us if villain checks all that shit back and we figured out hey villains are on average not betting often enough so maybe it's better for us to be on the big bad end if it's anyways indifferent against the solver but here i find the reasons because people have lots of gut shots lots of back doors which gives them a reason it's not the I have nothing it feels like they connect to the board and then after the check raise you realize that they have nothing but that's very very special okay let's get to the last example and then some more additional thoughts something we are now here the double barrel by the donk after calling race I didn't implement anything. I didn't want to search for that That's too special but a double barrel where we can use a small sizing and it makes a hell lot of sense Anyone coming up with four cards next four cards see an analysis for The double barrel with a small sizing ace five seven. i need four cards ace nine deuce nope i mean i set the next four cards so denny put on three cards that enough so small kind b gets the ace nine deuce maybe we even see some small betting but it's not a board i like because the reasoning behind the small bet is missing it's here it can be that we want to achieve a certain pot size but 6% nope. Any chance this stays on YouTube for a bit? I think so but I think it's always on the platform even available for free for a week at least or something so Christian99 you should be good. Jackdoos35 maybe? Yeah. So the point is the small bet attacks weak hands, obviously. So we need villain to have weak hands on the flop, that they fold on the turn, and best case is that those weak hands have equity. On ace, 9, deuce, yes, villain is floating some hands, but the hands that he's folding now versus a smaller bet, like jack, 10, queen, 10, queen an ace there's not much equity that we that we fold out that's not a big success right if we just drop down the low card the high card sorry make it a queen nine deuce then maybe we have more reason because we fold out king highs and ace highs actually something where it makes sense to bet small it's still five percent but we start having a reason to bet small right it's not the board that we are looking for yet right so it's like we bet all the king highs have have have a have a gut shot on top that makes it tough to fold them let's make it a queen seven deuce makes it a little better to try and fall out some king jacks and king tens hopefully we see like a little more than 5% now to just go with the flow here a little more than 5% turn double barrel It's still not the spot we're looking for We went from from 5 to 7. There's still lots of 50% So we are getting somewhere Let's see Jerome Jerome very good player here King 7 de. King-7-deuce and he makes it a jack. Interesting. Better card for us than the four for sure so we have more options. We see a 16% okay. We give ourselves an advantage, a jack. Right? It's a good card for us. Lots of fans that want to maybe buy a next card, go for a thin value, even the jack-10 we can bet. We have additional fold equity, what are we folding out? Is it a success if we fold it out? Let's have a look. Villain folds Ace-high, that's a big success, even for our King-Axe, we King-Axe we want to maybe play like that, for our Jack-Axe. Villain is folding something like Q8 suited, Q6 suited, big success for a Jack-Axe. So we need to give a chance to fold fold out over cards versus our kind of value hands that's very very good and maybe to fall out hands with like other kind of equity as well so here not yet but threes four is five sixes are something that lots of people will fold here so this is the small punches strategy again that there is a good chance that people start folding that what i like more is even better this one here not flush draw i just want to turn flop and jack of clubs and this year around i'm not sure whether it shows more percentage now probably about same but this is where i implemented a little more myself because it's more clearly the good card for me it leads to more big betting but I can do more and that means on average I can I can just I can do more overall and I can I can split things in a way I like so but it's the same thing right a two broadway card a second broadway card where I can still this is why the ace is not good where i can still deny equity of those overcrets right betting a king now i mean now a king is rather clear value but having a king five now going small folding out ace eight is a massive success i think 15 of the smallest big and if we add the half pot this is already 25 percent of the of the betting frequency that is not going big right so yeah this year is the big one right we go really crazy here how straight changing if it's two tone on the on the turn slightly i would say shouldn't be too much right so a little less of that easier to navigate again and a little less of the super crazy one because two-tone makes it a little better for in position reacting to rivers he can navigate better which means for out of position he wants to keep the pot smaller he has a little more positional disadvantage on rivers so he is a little more interested in waiting for the the river before blowing up the pot it makes it easy for in position there's always kind of the thought process. If it's easy for a villain on the river, keep the pot small. Small, yeah. It's more small. It's like 175% is not that small. All right. Why is ace bet card to keep betting small? Because if you value bet, you're not folding out any equity, right? Even if you value bet, you partly fold out equity and you get called by hands that have not good equity against you and here you fall out something like ace eight which is a massive success for a king instead of the check check because it's three free cards three cards that make villain a better hand that you likely pay off and so on if it's an ace and villain then folds out a king high and we say yes we have ace five he was drawing dead anyway so the check check doesn't hurt us on a non-ace high board the check check can hurt us if we have a weak top pair on the king high board it can hurt us i don't know whether i mixed up things right now but yeah it's the equity denial part okay those were the four examples I hope it was cool that I kind of put you in here in charge for finding those together and thinking a little before showing the ones I came up with. And now let's wrap, oh, like, let's, I show one last thing that will be part of the key takeaways. And therefore I will prefer my favorite board again and say exactly what we are making use of that villains are doing. Here, what do you think I want you to do when you have 10-8 offsuit? Can we go over the things we should look at per scenario? Not in this session, no time for that. But happy to, if you open up the thread on Discord or give like a certain request and I make another add-on video. But I don't want to go too deep when there is still a broader audience than like the 20 recs we have with the Poker Code members. Okay, delayed. So we are in the big blind now, right? This is a change. Delayed, see we had donk, small, double. We are the big blind now. What should you do with 10-8? One answer. The villain checked to us, we can't raise. Ace is marked, first right answer is bet. So this is the thing. If hands are indifferent, it means that anyways, in the solver world, both has the same EV. Now we figure out two things. People are over-folding, also as aggressor. And we know their checking ranges are weaker because they bet when they have something a little more. What else do we know? Well, maybe they end up calling calling but even more likely is that well maybe what we know for sure maybe they are folding but even if they are calling we know for sure that they are not check raising 13 percent right do they call their king 10 offsuit likely not and that is enough together with the future game tree we just over realize realize they are not check raising ace nine king nine like with those frequencies so we realize the equity hitting a ten. If it's indifferent and what I wrote down today is true then in the real world betting is better. Alright so just really understanding it like that indifference in the solver does not mean indifference in the real world. And usually, and now we have the knowledge how people are playing in a natural way, we know which one is slightly better. So maybe another shout out to a very, very, like one of the strongest coaches out there, Yuri Pelik, who maybe you can check out if you like the topic for YouTube videos. He made a couple, I think, not too many. He's a big, big, big fan of that and even starts betting something like, like, where is it? It goes for all the Ace-7 and Ace-8s here. Even Ace-8, like 100% check more or less. It's just like this just overrules everything. And he did probably more work on like database reviews or population tendencies than I did. So something like that is very, very important here. Okay, that gets us to the last slide. Key takeaways. We figured out why today, I just write it down again, the small punches can create a lot of EV. And I started with the last sentence here. Next, stay away from big fights. I don't want you to go triple barrel overbet all in crazy. This is not what I tried to teach today. It's big ranges, make sure of villain overfolding his shit part. People are bad with playing shit. People are not bad with playing strong hands. Maybe bad but in another way as well. So and this is what I just tried to explain once more when it's too long of a sentence but I didn't know how to make it a little more short. Whenever a hand is indifferent in the solver world you should likely go the more aggressive way when you benefit from villain folding. I needed to add that after the live play I did this morning you will get the video like within the next week probably of that where I focused on the wide range of spots. So there are some spots where you actually want to keep Willem in when he can only improve to second nuts. I checked back some over pairs on like a 4-3 deuce board and didn't want him to overfold. So this is why I needed to add that when you benefit from Willem folding. All right, think about the 10-8 spot right now. All right, thanks for everyone who was here. Yeah, I would love everyone who signs up. Poker isn't there already also the free account make use of that they are always definitely this video maybe it will be there for sure maybe you need a free account but since it's for free you can absolutely do it and everyone who i can welcome in the team at some point definitely happy to welcome you in the discord and yeah see you the latest in the next month for the next bigger coaching and yeah talk to you in discord i'm a little more in the office now the next week's summer is not over yet but it's the the main time and the the big off time for me is over now so yeah see you soon guys have a great day
