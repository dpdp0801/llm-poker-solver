### TOPIC: cash postflop blind vs blind after openraising hand review
 All right, let's go to the first practical part. I hope you've all seen the community coaching or maybe you have even been there last year in August about blind versus blind and the CBAT strategies in the small blind. So to maybe wrap that up again, it is very, very important to see this as like different topics in a way, different board types, different strategies. And to spot that on the go is very very important if you want to improve your blind versus blind game so today i'm trying to go through as many hands as possible actually i just pulled out the last 50 hands or so that i played without looking at it before so there will be mistakes in there but I hope I can explain a little something. I'll try to rapid fire through especially on the flops to just give the quick explanation what my strategy is range wise and how I see my hand within that range and then click through the hand and see what happens. So that's pretty much the plan. Hopefully you see lots of patterns that I've talked you through in the community coaching and you can take those and hopefully apply at the tables yourself. All right let's get started. King 8 off in the small blind, close open race, flop is ace king three. Now this this is one of the exception boards pretty much because range betting doesn't make too much sense there's no equity to be denied so something like a king five is just not that interest or pocket queens pocket jacks our advantage that we are having is pretty much more nutted part so here i want to want to have a big sizing, which I do not have very very often, and I play checking range as well. King-8 off perfectly fits into the checking range. If villain is behind, he pretty much is like he can't do anything. It's like he has runner runner maybe. And if he is ahead, well I have the same problem. I have probably five outs. So I start by checking. And as I said, rapid fire through. I can start stabbing small on that turn. We'll talk about that when we get to the delayed game tree. And then we go a little in-depth. But here, for now, I'm just checking. Go for a block bet for value. Get the fold. Let's see the next flop. And and actually i don't want to see people's hands that's just like a reason for biases so queen six of diamonds i'm open raising here and the flop is king nine eight now this is the first trade off board close to range but if it's king ten eight we get away with like 80% seabed frequency or even can up that to 100. Here it's not 100% so I definitely need to check some hands and as we have learned the biggest mistake we can be doing is choosing the wrong hands to check fold. We need to make sure our weakest hands are in the check folding range. Here that could be something like 4-5 of clubs. Maybe maybe queen five of clubs makes the cut but queen six of diamonds is definitely playable with the backdoors that i'm having definitely too weak to check call so it's like i guess a very very high c-bet frequency here turning six i'm definitely checking i have showdown value against all kinds of ace highs try to to bring it to showdown. Too weak for a block bet. If I face a bet, this is one kind of random catcher. It goes check, check and villain head. Well, one of the ace highs that beat me on the turn. Totally fine. Easy flop play. C-bet, high frequency, small sizing. Ace-4 off. Next one. Queen-7-3. Very, very different board again. Queen-10-3. We could range bet. Thank you. Ace-4 off. Next one, Q7-3. Very very different board again. Q10-3 we could range bet. Q7 is not as good for us as like the small blind player who has all the offsuit broadways, so just less connectivity. But 7-3 there's some connectivity there that favors actually the big blind. Always think ahead which turn cards are good or bad. 4, 5, 6 all great for the big blind so I cannot go a hundred percent here but I can still see that rather high frequency with a small sizing. Ace-4 I think with a backdoor straight draw wants to bet most of the time. A check is not out of that world though Getting the fold from something like King nine is just a perfect success here All right King three suited 844 that board paired board Low card is paired. Villain has the advantage 8-4 is straight connectivity gives villain advantage so villain has advantage right now with a four villain has advantage over time given the 8-4 connectivity the flush draw always evens out things a little well because i can catch up versus his trips and vice versa but here that's like not necessarily a range check board but very very very close so king three of hearts definitely a check fold here for me it could be a bet against a recreational player because he won't be raising so i could see myself betting here sometimes but against competent players it's definitely a check fold. 9-8 off on 9-7-6. Not as bad that board as something like 7-5-4 because the 9 high still gives our offsuit hand some connectivity. We have jack 10 100%. We have 10-8 some good percentages. We have queen 10 queen jack which gives us all the backdoor straights in the world so again it's a board where big blind is the favorite but not like like crushing crushing it so checking seems fine betting seems fine with my specific hand here i went for the check and check check on the turn I decided to go for a large value bet and go from there taking it down pretty standard. All right pocket eights on Jack nine eight. Jack nine eight now hmm everyone has all nuts in the world so we need to play real real poker. Definitely not a range bet board, definitely not a range check board. So it is one of those clear trade-off boards. Villain has queen 10 off, all of them. Villain has 10-7 suited, maybe some 10-7 off even. He has jack-9 offsuit, 9-8 offsuit, jack-8 offsuit, just all of it. So we need to stay balanced in a way. And here I go with my look-alike principle and have like some patterns that I try to implement here. I'm checking most of my eight axes, so I'm checking my pocket eights at the same time. Most of the time. Betting is totally fine. Jacks, I make it a little vice versa. I I bet most of the time because I'm betting most of my jacks small But pretty much everything needs to be in all kinds of ranges here. I go for the check and goes check check turn Ten makes a straight all of us have it. I think stabbing is fine, but does not really accomplish too much So I I go for one large river bet. And that's it. This is really lots of talking. But let's see how many more hands we get through. Ace-4 again. So Jack-Jack-10 now again appeared bored and connected. But this time, it's more like the peered advantage for the small blind. He has all offsuit jack-x in the world. Plus, the connectivity here actually is an advantage for the small blind. Not advantage right now, not advantage over time. If there is a king on the turn, the big blind won't have ace-queen. If there is a queen on the turn, the big blind won't have ace-king. So this is a board that we can definitely bet with our full range and again it's a success if i make villain fold his five eight of spades with that exact hand and if he calls on average it's good for me because i have all the advantages in the world turn is an ace villain floats i guess most of his high, so definitely checking a lot here on that turn. Ace-4 just wants to have one more street, one more small bet that I try to take here. I think I can even bet bigger, but it's close. Alright, ace-jack here on ace-6-6. again appear at board where the question is where is our or villain's advantage villains should have more six x that tells us we should do lots of checking we have the better ace x and the question is okay how where's the goal where we want to grow the pot to definitely not all in right so checking is not the worst thing here in the world and that is again the same we want to do with another part where we have our advantage we have kings we have queens we have jacks they're not interested in betting too much yes we fold out stuff by betting if villain just has like random something but betting something like king queen to fold out weaker king and queen highs just doesn't accomplish anything so here i'm playing quite a high checking frequency only betting my strongest aces maybe ace jack seems quite indifferent what i do i think i ended up checking here check call a half pot bet see what comes up i mean this year is a recreational player so i just call down his half pot bets and see weirdly played pocket Kings so okay let's not worry about that. Let's face the next board ace-five offsuit again very very clear trade-off board. It's actually one of those boards that are somewhat of another exception. We had the ace-king-axe before and Here we have low, but not that connected. There's not like it's not 7-6 It's not 5-4 not too many open-enders. So open-enders only exists suited here, which is just way less in combinations and Therefore it makes a lot of sense to use a big size here pocket 8s pocket nines they are pretty much nuts right now they want to grow the pot by either betting big or by check raising a small bet here doesn't accomplish anything because the big blind either has something that has straight connectivity and can float for that reason or he has six outs to top here right even a jack 10 offsuit without the backdoor is kind of interested in that pot even in king eight something like that so a small bet just like doesn't accomplish anything ace five i guess is just a very i mean not mandatory check but a high frequency check and we go from there check calling normal bet sizes two. River would be a tougher decision and we have a pure bluff catcher but yeah we win against his weaker second pair that added a flush draw. All right queen eight of hearts again now you see the first times how patterns start building right again a paired board sixes that means big blind has an advantage let's maybe just check out i think we talked about that in the community coaching but maybe check out where the threshold is again for paired boards which offsuit hands offsuit means lots of combos does the small blind have just all the time and where does he start like not having them anymore this is where we have the big blinds advantage and you see you will see it look it up in all kinds of ranges small blind likes nines and plus right in the small one we are raising 100 queen nine off king nine off ace nine off but not those offsuit eights that often and then with the sevens it really stops so here sixes are good for the big blind connectivity in that area again good for the big blind so not necessarily range check but very very high frequency check i'm going for the check call check check and here i go for the block bet and against that race here i'm believing and call it a day ace 10 offsuit 10 8 deuce again you see all of that in a way trade off boards again 10 gives us nice connectivity with our broadway stuff 10 8 is like connected in a way that both players have it the deuce as a brick is way better for us than like a five something like that so we can bet quite a high frequency here definitely not full range we give up something like queen five of clubs king four of diamonds that's fine ace 10 one of the hands that is pretty nutted right now not necessarily later is interested in growing a pot. Here I'm only using small sizings but a check race is maybe a fancy idea as well or just betting, hoping to get raised sometimes, is a cool thing here as well. On that turn I think betting and checking is both fine. I'm checking lots of ace highs on that turn because the six is a good card for villain so I think I want to put my ace ten in here quite sometimes. With like maybe I remember that hand from in-game I had the plan to actually check raise for value against smaller sizes so if some people like stabbing their weaker ten acts here they are eight acts they're nine acts so with like not necessarily huge sizing while fast playing like they're two pairs and straights so maybe a little exploitative but going for a check race against a small sizing check hall against a bigger size and go from there and here i tried the same thing again right i'm not bluffing my ace of spades ever so using the lookalike principle here if i have ace five spades and way, ace-queen of spades. So I check that here and if he bets any sizing and probably is check raising. And apparently someone decided to not bluff his jack-7. Okay. Ace-5 off, queen-10 deuce. Not much to talk about. We can range bet that board. We can build a checking range if we want that is built around some 10x some pocket nines give up five six of clubs but that's about it right so just i call the range bet board doesn't mean necessarily 100 betting but it's like the 85 90 region and against people who might not raise enough who might overfold then just like betting any hand turns out to be pretty great on those those board types here i have ace five even with the ace of hearts great one to to start betting against that race i just give a lot of credit on those boards against population so even though i have a backdoor flush draw backdoor straight draw and seems kind of tempting i'm not going to start anything here 9 10 offsuit boom nothing to talk about offsuit straights for the villain that i'm never having nuts for him now nuts for him on the runouts this is the clearest range check of all times and then i'm actually sometimes i'm allowed to be fancy i'm checking fours fives eights six seven and I can check raise something like pocket nines pocket tens here and this here fits into my bluffing range so I'm sometimes check raising that not as like nut equity but it's just like folding out his kind of bullshit he's allowed to stab something like queen 10 and jack 10 and jack 9 very high frequency here and this is what i'm attacking actually getting this one through obviously feels great a6 offsuit ace 9 for rainbow pretty disconnected we can bet a very very very high frequency right we can again build a checking range or like around kings and king highs and some weak aces and some give ups or we can just bet that and start splitting on the turn. Both strategies are totally valid and fine. Queen five of hearts, classic trade off board again. I talked about the big bet on nine five tw-2s or 7-5-2s rainbow before. Here it changes a little when there is a flush draw because villain has a range part that is significantly weaker than on a rainbow board. If villain has something like king-8 here without the backdoor, just like he only has four nice outs instead of six now, right? Or just like talking about two over cards something like queen jack so it makes sense to use a small sizing here as well queen five fits in a bet and in a check that's both fine and wow this is a nice one i don't remember that hand yeah i always try to be fancy here okay this is an interesting half pot bet starting with that ace-10 here but okay queen-10 offsuit, ace-jack-deuce. We had ace-king before where I said Hey, it makes a lot of sense to use a big size because we have the nut advantage right now Here we are like in between. That's the question. Villain doesn't have jacks, villain doesn't have aces. Does villain have ace-jack or is he three betting that? That's the big question. If he is always three betting ace-jack that's another perfect board to start going big with your ace-king, ace-queen type of hands and like all kinds of draws. Here I decided to mix it up in the end. Queen-10 just fits perfectly in the big bet well and in the small bet as well but yeah one of those sports all right ace 10 offsuit trade off board nine seven connectivity pretty good for in position but not too bad for us either way it's fine i'm not betting full range not betting 80 plus but definitely more than 50 king nine just a nice kind of nice thing for us Yeah, so is ace ten can be betting like ace six ace eight i'm probably always checking this year with like another three outer to that ten is just a little stronger so building a pot is not wrong and yeah ace five ace two is three actually now the same thing it's not an ace high board where we have an advantage any deuce any three any four any five wins that shit for the big blind the flush draw doesn't make it way better and yeah ace deuce ace three if we look at the ranges i'm having is actually not 100% open raises from the small small blind so we are lacking some two pairs yeah this is actually a very very high frequency check right something like ace 5-4 would actually like with more straight connectivity on both ends of the 5-4 would actually be a range check here we can put some bets out but it's definitely a high checking frequency board checking down going for a block bet on the river i think that's a mistake and i need to bet big here against this king x that he has a lot of yeah this is just a waste of value i guess but okay ace four off it looks like a very good board for the big blind it is not necessarily because that 10-9 is nice connectivity for us as well queen jack king queen king jack so this is one of those where we need to just mix a lot of things i will play with a small bet and check only big bets do not make sense villain is freaking protected on a dynamic board where position is the key yeah ace four i'm trying to use my suits here i will always check with the ace of clubs this is just to give up on that board and yeah if i have the ace of diamonds or just at least the ace of spades that works way better all right queen eight suited big bet or checking back a board for me on ace king deuce queen high makes it in a check very often so yeah not surprised facing a big bet i have a very clear and easy decision another ace four off jack nine if the third card was like a low card we can bet a very high frequency here but here again offsuit straight on the board villain can have 10-8 off full frequency so we need to be careful big bet not possible small bet yes some decent frequency but not too crazy again if that is turned around with the ace of hearts four of clubs i'm probably betting like that i don't like it too much you see i did end up betting here will bring me in lots of tough turn turn spots hoping to check down against king queen but not today it's three all right i just that's the plan i just i keep going talking about the same pattern over and over five six nine very very very very good for the in position player. The 9 is high enough to not make it a full range check I guess, but it's very close to that. A hand like this is just nothing else but a check fold and that is just very very important. In the next, let's call it chapters of that blind versus blind series we will definitely be talking about how to play check raises here, what is the right strategy, how to keep playing with our nutted hands that we started checking on the flop, very important, and our strong but over time not nutted hands. How do we play something like tens, like jacks on that board very very interesting topics all right nine eight offsuit four deuce not good for us queen good for us typically typical example for a range bet board nine eight i like the eight of spades if i have nine eight of hearts here i'm check folding nine eight with that suit i probably see betting sometimes check folding sometimes and now i go for a delayed step here just against anything folding out jack nine is a big success queen seven ten seven three again the definition of a trade off board. Betting small is fine. Checking is fine. And then having check calls and check raises. I definitely mixed that in game and ended up check calling here. And yeah, that turns out to be a very, very easy hand, I guess. Adding a flush draw on the turn and facing a half pot bet. I feel pretty great about that. River is a great great card for in position and he starts sizing up to 150 percent i think that's not the perfect hand to start being a hero so yeah pretty easy hand five seven suited open raising this year again villain should or i know about him he's definitely three betting ace off every single time. So I want to use a big bet on that board, having the advantage now. Not waiting to see like a King-Jack-10 that lets him catch up regarding nuts. 5-7 with a backdoor straight draw and the flush draw obviously fits in both ranges. And here I decided to check. I can see myself betting. I can see myself checking both fine. Turn five gives me showdown value. I keep checking here. Check raising would be an option. And on that river King, I think I can do pretty much anything. I'm checking most pretty much all five X though. So I decided to check my five X flush draw at the same time. And unfortunately didn't get a bet in and he checked down pocket threes. That's fine. Here we have a full knit and this is an exploitative race that should be part of our normal strategy. And this is how I play those boards then. I'm just giving up. My plan was to or I took the EV preflop of him over folding a bunch and now I'm not trying to make anything happen with Shit, right? It could be an idea that he is so tight He only has King Queen and King Jack offsuit, but this is just where I'm not I cannot be sure I will bluff rivers stuff like that, but not blast and build a pot Alright, he's for offsuit monotone boards very very very very often range check boards it's just position is so powerful when the nuts are not changing pretty much right so he can just see what happens and then he can navigate through facing bets with having clubs being protected having a straight one card clubs nuts etc he doesn't need to fast play anything. So we want to keep this spot small until we know more pretty much here. That already hurts not having a club, having that gutshot here and on the turn he plays kind of nice, I guess, and fucks me up. And I probably just fall to queen nine with a nine of clubs, but nothing I can do. Again, same super knit who apparently plays eight four after 24 hands at that point of time. And here it's such a range bet board and I have something, right? I give up my three eight of diamonds, but here I just try to play my hand in a way and then not make anything crazy and actually win, right? So we see, okay, I ran diamonds it's fine queen eight off it's usually a fold or like only a frequency open race against weaker players i'm a little on the lighter side king four three pure pure trade off board it's just yeah four three good for the big blind the king is fine for us it will be about 50 50 c-bet and check only small sizing that queen aid with the i call it the fake backdoor suits i don't have a backdoor flush but i have the suits of the backdoor flushes i like betting here quite often and then on the turn it's just yeah not my card another queen eight now villain has definitely all ace tens so no reason to go with a large bet here making use of him like being capped or anything so very high frequency small bet i have all the draws in the world i have the advantage on that yeah so you see i have the eight of hearts which is a very very bad card but anyways still decide to c-bet go from there keep going with my double gutter now and yeah just just keep going all the way here and yeah get called by a freaking 10-9 which is quite interesting since i mean having a 10 is maybe cool but the 9 is definitely a very bad card since 9-8 and queen 9 are just very very natural buffs so yeah shout out to him trying to be a hero and being right that's fine and i think my bluff is it's kind of standard especially not having diamonds feels good ace king range check nothing to talk about super easy and then go from there all right so trying to keep everything in that I've dominated now still I have I think it's a clear big bet if it was a little less connected I can see myself going for check race against his King Queen King Jack King 10 but yeah he could just have like all the two pairs in the world not I'm not sure. Yeah, I think this is how I get the maximum out of king 10. While not losing more against his stronger hands. 5-5-4, very, very close to a range check actually. The 4-5 connectivity, very good for the big blind. The fives as a paired board, very, very good for the big blind. I apparently play against the 70 BB stack. So I just play my play my hand try to fold out jack 10 get calls from ace high and be happy to check fold bad runouts so yeah that's clear exploit here usually this is a pretty pretty clear check most of the time yeah ace eight again rainbow not really that i mean it is connected but not like that connected this is a board where we can use big sizes attack villains jack 10 queen jack queen 10 ace 8 definitely a check though i guess a full frequency check even especially with the ace of hearts i'm not interested in building a pot and again on that queen it's check as well even though on that queen we can it's like the perfect card for us We can start betting a lot here. Maybe already a little preview to delayed betting. Just take one card from the flop away. And just take the turn card as a new part of the flop. So that sounds a little weird probably, but just take the 3 away and make it a queen 9-6 now. Or take the 6 away and make it queen 9-3. Take the 9 away and 90 away make it queen six three this is pretty much what tells you already how you can play that turn and all those boards have that same trigger of yeah lots of small betting probably hey i checked down here i win against some weaker ace highs that's the plan of that ace eight perfect king queen queen nine very very nice uh high frequency board if it was queen nine deuce it would be even better the nine six connectivity not great for me so it will be more in the 70 betting region always a small sizing go from there that three should be a full break here and yeah something we will we'll learn more about in our section about double barreling is that go from there that three should be a full break here and yeah something we will we learn more about in our section about double barreling is very fancy large overpads actually going direction all in preparing for great runouts king queen being the thinnest value hand here probably but villain is raising sixes six nine suited queen nine queen six mainly on the flop he doesn't add any offsuit two pairs so he's pretty much having maybe six three suited queen three suited some pocket threes and that's about it everything else i have beat while he has plenty of draws so yeah it's a good one that four is yeah pretty nice card i think i mean villain can have five seven as a double gutter on the turn that's about it he shouldn't add any more two pairs like a jack or ten would be bad for my exact hand so here i think pio likes to take like a normal size now to force villain to make quite some calls with the queen jack queen 10 queen 8 queen 7. i think I had a calling station read and went a little crazy. This is like value betting lighter than it's allowed from the solver. I'm pretty sure about that. But yeah, I had a pretty good reason there. All right, king, queen, again, same patterns. And this is, it might be repetitive, but this is how we are learning 5-5 good for big blind 5-9 connectivity not too bad 5-8 5-7 5-6 would be all worse so here we could still do something but king queen definitely likes the check the most having a check call here i'm check raising weaker hands actually something like jack of hearts 10 i like to raise here. Here I just want to keep villains bluffs in. If he's bluffing queen 10, queen, jack, king 10, I have upside on my side. And here I think king high still has showdown value, so I'm checking this one down and yeah get partly proven right I guess. All right, couple more hands to go. Ace three offsuit,uit ace five three we talked about that already deuce is bad for us three is bad for us four is bad for us five is bad for us range wise not necessarily for our hand and yeah we our broadways are all shit like our jack ten jack nine queen ten queen jack all hopeless bullshit so mainly checking that board even with a two pair like that. Blunt checks back, turn unfortunately is another five and Trill starts stabbing big. That's not what we wanted to see. Having a clear call and then a river decision that I, lucky me, didn't have to make. Next one, I have a mid pair, lots of people start checking here but this is just such a nice range bet board i go full frequency and start splitting on the turn makes the strategy so nice and easy i know exactly my range i have good things happening for me and yeah okay facing a min race we play lots of fancy guys out here facing a third pot here check check deuce five hearts he was putting me on ace king going for the max value okay eight nine suited pretty similar if it was queen nine four or three i'm like very close to range betting the five makes it a little worse so i'm allowed to check here as well but mainly on the betting side here calling a raise with my backdoor I'm not sure what's happening here another big bet I mean this is in theory definitely call I can see myself making all kinds of moves like I can see a raise and I can see a fold. I don't know what I did like every every option is valid for me and here I actually went crazy. Yeah maybe having that that read or impression that actual value hands would go a little bigger on that type of turn card and this is way more the jack 10 king jack king 10 type of hands which i'm obviously ahead against but in my hand just just has very very bad river play ability so i'm turning it to a bluff i don't know how much of a thing that is i like it against certain people having some reads and here i'm it's not my favorite spot but i think it's okay to sometimes go crazy right this is exactly the way I would play my pocket nine so it somehow makes sense and my eight six suited as well so yeah can't be too bad nine ten eight eight as the paired board is not too bad for me not as good as nine nine so I'm not range betting here but I can have some frequency here check call totally fine as well even check race would be fine with that hand 10 on the fards this is very close to a range check 7-4-4-4-4 good for villain connectivity good for villain on that 7 I start block betting I'm block betting most of my ace highs here just to fold out get called by king high fold out any type of equity and this is exactly what that hand wants to achieve as well fold out jack nine jack ten clean outs five three suited again against a nitty player slide to open race clear trade off board check call maybe even check race and c-bet all fine options Thanks for watching! your player flight to open race clear trade off board check call maybe even check race and cbet all fine options and yeah against nits that do not do i mean see i'm quite active in this zoom 200 pool it's mainly against those nitty players that usually tell me when they have something it's like yes ace jack and then i know that this type of player is just sizing up on the turn so if he has that he maybe has ace eight or he's just on a draw but i cannot call my hand so i'm just taking the money by raising all right king queen again we had ace ten five lots of those board types ace king we like the big bet ace queen we like the big bet ace jack ace ten and a low card we prefer the small bet with high frequency yeah i think i can keep barreling that turn and check calling seems fine as well and oops this is this has to be a misclick like this is not okay yeah I mean he doesn't have too much stack left but I'm still ahead of a lot of things I have nut gutshot and I don't know whether I can make something happen on spades but this this fold is not okay ace deuce very very light open here now c betting that board very high frequency the turn four is a bad card for me since three five gets there villain has ace four deuce four gets there i mean great for my hand but not for my range so i i'm not betting very high frequency here but betting with a pretty polarized range and Ace-Deuce, I guess, will be in there quite often. Against active players, I like to barrel here a little more because I can be sure that they are raising lots of 3-5 on the flop. And I just keep going here. And River6, yes, he has me beat with Ace-4 and Ace and a6 and that's pretty much it so five three should raise the turn and that will play a role here in a second i keep going three quarters again and villain jams which is a huge jam here i expect villain to raise his ace eight on the flop mainly or then on the turn i'm not sure whether villain is jamming his a6 on the river. I mean probably yes, that's bad luck. But here I was really confused like 3-5 is four combinations. This is an active player so he definitely knows that he should raise that most of the time on the flop. So it gets really really thin on value side here and yeah i ended up like i don't see too many bluffs here that's my problem and i love over folding in big spots in in zoom 200 but yeah i tanked for like a while and made the call and to my big surprise i have seen a i don Is that a value jam? It has to be, but I think it's too thin, right? It's like that four is so bad that I'm not barreling all my ace, king, ace, queen, ace, jack here and then keep going. That would be just too thin, I guess. So yeah, maybe I need to look that up and I'm just too nitty. Him having eight, six off very interesting as well, but okay take it. Queen-6 classic trade off board nothing to talk about that that hand works fine as a c-bet as a check call. Probably folding that turn check fold yeah. And now one of the last hands pocket queens king 8-5 same thing queens with the clubs are betting more often those are more of a check both is fine check check check call check fold versus the upside seems fine king nine i guess is this the last hand yeah you see like again trade off board king nine having a top here sometimes going to check getting a bad turn but yeah now taking a block bet on the river and that's it so i know this was pretty repetitive but this was pretty much the goal right so really seeing those boards and over and over overthinking through what are the upsides for my range, what are the downsides. What is better for in position, what is better for out of position. Paired boards, what's the card, which cards are better for who. Connectivity, low straight connectivity, high straight connectivity, what is better for who. Flush draw on there or not. Some kind of exception boards like ace, king, deuce or like 7-5 deuceuce rainbow something like that where we want to implement big bets as well lots of different things and going from there and maybe repeating the community session as well which i think is just so important as the starting point we will talk about okay what to do against those small c-bats when we are in position this will be the next video and then what happens if we are checking how to build stabbing ranges as the big blind so lots of big blind play coming up next and yeah until then have fun crushing from the small blind putting the small bats out there putting the block bats on the river out there splitting things correctly having a nice idea how you should play certain board types and yeah good luck at the tables
