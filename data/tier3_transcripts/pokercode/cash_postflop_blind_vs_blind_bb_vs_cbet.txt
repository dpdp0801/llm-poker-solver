### TOPIC: cash postflop blind vs blind bb vs cbet
 Let's actually get started. We had lots of blind versus blind coachings already because it's the most important spot. When we try to open, sit, maybe even play some three-handed, four-handed, that's very important for me nowadays. So I really break it down to the most important spots. It's not like under the gun versus big blind that obviously only happens when we play six max and so on. This is where we can gain the biggest edge. It's lots of heads up pots, very wide ranges. And I want you to not play it perfectly, but I want you to have an idea and to have a structure. Here we go. This is the plan. We look at the spot. What are we talking about? Just to be sure. Then we'll talk again about cornerstones of our range. Why is that important? I think we all know that by now, but still it's the concept I have in my mind. I'll give a couple of examples and actually I will give you cornerstones for different board types, right? If I think about raising, which you should do in every time we face a c-bet, they are to just know what's going on. You have like a couple of boxes you want to fill something in and they are slightly different regarding each board. Yeah, that's the plan. I will present my personal boxes I use for like finding those raises. This will be combined with some examples and then we'll talk after we figured out what is the correct raising range? How should it look like? We talked a little shortly about turn play. Depending on time, we'll have a look at that go back at the examples and find a certain way of how I work personally through GTO Wizard or like Pyosolver and so on to really remember stuff. Talk about some exploitative thoughts that I have personally, and then obviously come back to the key takeaways. I can tell you already the add-on fitting to the little GTO Wizard series is a drill I'm playing. And actually I can tell you, I did this this morning and I never had that much fun playing a drill. And the drill was actually the one that I went for a custom spot, small blind open raises. We call in the big blind and I forced the small blind to see that small. So every time I'm in this race, yes or no, call yes or no spot. And I gave myself the job to race every single time when it's somehow possible. So I was trying to find all those low frequency raises that we usually skip or forget or whatsoever. So I actually managed to play with like, I made some mistakes for sure. And lots of inaccuracies because it was very low frequency raises, but almost no EV loss, which I like to see. And I played very, very fancy, but it made sense still in the GTO way. So it just shows a little how much room there is and this is a big recommendation for every one of you to be doing to just see okay what is possible what can we change in our game maybe this is something to exploit all right so let's go back to the spot it's very very clear blind versus blind just to be sure villain open raises we decide to call and then villain decides to c-bet the flop in all the examples we will be talking small c-bets because this is the majority of stuff that is happening against big c-bets we are trapping a lot villain is polarized we are not raising that much maybe super tiny ranges so that's not what is really interesting so it's like when we build a wider raising range and now let's get to the first part corner cornerstones of our range. And one thing, how I understood that instead of remembering everything, when we look at the solver, what is a raise, what is a frequency raise? Again, this is a wild mix. I kind of turned things around and thought about, okay, what do I need? What do I need in my raising range? And what I need is actually, I want to cover all kinds of runouts. So give you an example let's say we obviously raise like two pairs and sets and gut shots and flush draws but then for example what happens on a brick let's say we raise on something like king seven five right so I want to say not a deuce but a deuce brings us straight there so now king seven five and now it's not a four it's not a five it six, eight whatsoever. What do we do on those cards? Do we need something to cover that as well? What are actually our bluffs on certain good cards for us if everything gets there? How can we still have bluffs? What do we need you to be prepared for? So we have looked at all examples for 100 big blinds, but it will work for deeper than that as well. And it will be tough to use that for 50 big blinds. Like for 100 big blinds but it will work for deeper than that as well and it will be tough to use that for 50 big blinds like for 50 big blinds and lower it will change quite a lot for getting all in blind versus blind usually if there's not heavy over betting involved we need four streets of betting which means we need someone to put in a race it's just a bet bet bet only works when you take large over bets so actually we need a bet then a race and then two bets and this is the kind of normal way of getting all in for 50 big lines three bets are enough and this is why we don't need to raise our very very strong hands that much it's more we start raising our vulnerable hands a little more denial gets more important. We will be trapping more because we can still manage to get stacks in at any point if there was not a check somewhere. But if Bill and CBATs, we call, we have two streets left. We need to total three streets for 50 big mines and less. So we don't need to raise it that much. We'll be more something that needs to deny equity, the nuts right now, but not necessary later. So here, our raising range will be very, very nut driven and not equity driven, where I say, okay, the first thing is we want to understand what can be nuts on certain boards. This is what we want to cover. Maybe King 7-5 is one of the examples today. King 7-4-4, I think, is the example where what can be nuts? On a brick run out, it's all the two pairs and sets that we raise very high frequency. Easy. On straight run out, well, it's the straights. So we want to cover those. On a flush run out, it's obviously the flush is the nut. So we want to cover those. If the backdoor flush draw gets there, we want to cover this one as well well maybe besides that there are not many other cards maybe some more bricks where we like to add some value hands as well right king seven four what will be nuts on a deuce obviously the nuts we have but maybe we would like to add something something else on the deuce maybe some backdoor straights can be nuts maybe we want to cover those as well everything that can be nuts the river we want to cover those as well. Everything that can be nuts on the river, we want to cover in a way. That's the first plan of our raising range because once we start raising, we keep the option alive to play for the full stack. This looks a little different when we just call. Obviously, we can at all times in no limit hold and we can go all in, but often it just doesn't make sense when Will is protected. We use different bet sizes and then we need him to raise to get all the money in the middle so this is what is the big difference between something like 50 big blinds and 100 big ones and this is now what our first thought should be about how a raising range should look like it's not about do we have it right now or not or and so on it's more what will be nuts on the river and how can we cover those carts coming from you also consider the pre-range will be very different here due to rake yes mtt ranges are way way way wider but actually the raising ranges look kind of similar when we are deep stacked because those are only hands that want to build a pot all the weaker stuff that you can play because of empty and no rake is mainly in the limping range so actually a raising range let's actually have a look there range viewer open raising we are in the small mind strap so okay this is 100 big minds not much raising if that is true okay but you see actually everything that we are raising looks a little like all the area that we are raising cash games as well it's like very different frequencies maybe a little more like that right you skip a little that offsuit part that needs fold to three bet, but all the hands that we are folding are not in your raising range either. So it's in a way kind of similar when we look at the full structure. All right, now coming to the point cornerstones, what is important to me is that you know your raising range. I gave you already the hint. We think about what can be nuts on the river, how you cover that actually doesn't matter. It doesn't matter too much. Lots of mixes again in Pio we've learned. Mixes just tell you it doesn't matter. But I like to have a high raising frequency because it puts infinite pressure on villain and it's tough to play against out of position. But knowing is more important than copying something, whether you have 30% of that or 20 or 50, or you take other hands to cover something. You can simplify that, can say something stupid like not stupid but something very simple like i'm always raising jack high flush draws and you always call 10 high flush draws your frequencies will be all right and no one will ever figure out or you could obviously say i take every random flush draw that has nothing special going for it and you raise it like 25 30 percent of the time would be a little more balanced but in the end that's the same you cover flushes that's what is important so now it gets important to understand as well for further preparation what are we looking for how do our cornerstones interact with turn cards to already have a follow-up plan so okay sometimes that is self-explaining we have a flush draw we try to hit a flush if it flush, we keep betting. If we have a backdoor flush draw and there's a full break on the turn, we probably give up. If we turn our flush draw then, well, then we probably keep going a little, right? It's a little like that. Maybe we have some offsuit full bluff or like we have draw to top here and the backdoor flush draw to go with it. Oh, flush card now there, let's say a third spade on the board. We have a high spade. We probably keep going. Once we know what our range is, what the goals of certain parts are, it gets very, very intuitive often on the turn. But a little of this and a little of that, but remembering it that way is super tough. So I want you to know, okay, this is why I'm doing this. This is why I'm doing that. Which hands exactly do not matter too much. Okay. And I actually guess it's the best to jump right into the action and look at examples. The three examples I'm using today are those here. So I remember the first one correctly after some time. It's a flush draw board, king seven four with some connectivity. So the first two are very, very typical trade-off boards. I didn't go for any range bet board because Thierry Villain has such a big advantage. Yes, there is some raising going on, but it's not where I want to do lots of exploiting or where I try to raise like even more than Pio. I think it's very important. No, Thierry's more reaction game and simplification is very good. Maybe call a little more because just by the definition of the board, it's good for a villain. It will be kind of easy to react for him. King-jack-4, he continues with all his straight draws, his good top pairs, and so on. King-7-4, it will be way tougher because just continuing when he has a pair is not enough. And low pairs already suck. And it's likely that there is a chance that villain is over C-betting those. And then he will be in big trouble. I'll ask you guys. I know you guys know better what is right than what you show on the table because I'm doing the same, right? For a purpose. So how often are you in-game c-betting on King 7-4, the board as it is here? Just snap right me a little number in the chat. You get some 80%. Here we go. Okay. And now how often is GTO Wizard c betting that board 60 55 45 50 all right so we are c betting a lot even though we know it's like not correct in theory so let's have a look let's take this one here we have actually 40 c bet but actually lots of you guys are going for 80 which i'm doing as well against lots of opponents because they do not raise enough and they overfold. So I make money by c-betting too wide here. But this is now understanding the weapon we can create now in that session against yourself. It's good to know where you could get exploited and to know the weapon against players that play like you, right? I actually reviewed one week of hands of a high-stakes buddy of mine who is way, way, way... He's like super crazy. I'm like way closer to GTO Wizard than he is. He crushes. But you can kill him with raises. I see him here with ace, eight of diamonds going for the c-bet. We're like, if you go for that, it's not a mistake if you look at the one hand. But if he goes for that, that just means for me, he goes for all the queen tens as well. He goes for all the mixed jack tens as well. He doesn't have as many strong hands. So if he bets and we look at our raising range, right? Here we see like a total raising range of like 10% and the folding range against that of 40. Like there's no way he folds less than 50% against that. Or he continues and then overfolds to the turn, which is a great exploit. it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If people are not ready to do it, they can do it. If and then over folds to the turn, which is a great exploit if people are not raising enough, but we want to understand things a little more, a little more, and then play. Maybe there's even more EV in just raising a lot and to play a game tree that after some preparation, we know way better than villain, right? It's like, how scared are you guys when you get raised? Call, turn freaking three of hearts check i could ask you for the sizing now we go for a big sizing right and then villain pots or goes 125 percent what are you guys doing with king queen here fold fold fold one fold only so far i'm expecting some more shitting my pants sometimes call and then off table think like why in this world did i end up calling right fold fold fold fold fold you know all the king x are indifferent but if you don't call them with some frequency king queen is actually sometimes jamming here then we know it's not the flop fold equity it's it keeps going like that they are like okay that's the seven x of spades that's what people continue we could keep even going and wait for a river eight of diamonds oh he's, he's even donking. That's definitely not happening. And then we jam and villain needs to call. Well, ace king down. Something like good old seven, six call down. So if we see that over streets, there's no chance that a wreck is calling enough. And again, this is balanced by the pool because no one is as crazy as GTO wizard here. Turnwise, king-Queen jamming, don't we want to keep their bluffs in? While their bluffs have some equity and the stuff for King-Queen doesn't get better, big blind should sometimes have King-Jack, maybe something like that. But stuff does not get better for us. And for our hand, there's not more information to be gained. This is what you usually then just randomly jam. It's like a zero EB bluff catch, but jamming still still performs better probably because you get it in against some gear plus flush draw and stuff like that but this is like very very special pile thing like if we jam here right villain now after raising king six off somehow needs to call that off whatever he needs to call off seven x of spades some random merge like that okay so here we are and now i will show you my cornerstones in the next slide. But first, I want you to tell me yours. Let's say the first cornerstone is the intuitive value, we don't need to talk about two pairs and sets. So I'm more about maybe some kind of value that is non intuitive. And then all the different types of gloves, maybe everyone in the chat, take some time. I'll give you a minute or two. Make a list like first, second, third, and think about what are you personally raising or if you're not raising enough, think about what you want to be raising from now on. I start like let's say I make a very easy list, right? This would be a very easy list for all the ones not seeing the chat, watching that on platform i just wrote first flush draw second open ender third nut backdoor flush draw but it's a clear thing i know what i'm doing there if i just have that it's not enough i can tell you that but it's how i think of that list in a way poker bro goes with strong top pair some 7x as the mid pair some 4x he chooses those with backdoor he goes. He goes with a backdoor flush, backdoor straight, plus ace high. So something like 4-5 suited with a backdoor flush draw. We have the ace high, flush draws, open-enders. Here, nevermore. This is not a list, but a great hand. The ace of spades 5 to fold out some better aces. Good backdoor equity and have bluffs on spade runouts. Already thinking a lot ahead, right? So he talks about the runouts already. He has a plan for the turn. There's no way he will misplay this hand after raising. Christian goes with open-ender gutshot with spade or a club, right? So we talk about gutshots. It's tough here because we only have those gutshots suited. So here, if we are talking about boards with higher hand ranks, then we actually take those suits to have some backdoor flush going and so on here. I think we only have 8-6, 8-5. We only have it suited. So it's a little irrelevant. 7x with spades. That's kind of a value hand, but nice to have in a raising range as well and cover that turn 7. That doesn't help us usually. 4x with backdoor flush draw. Already an idea, right? We cover flushes. We cover the backdoor flush. We now even cover cover the board pair that usually is a bad card for us ace deuce ace three ace four with a spade right just an over card cleaning outs folding out something like ace eight ace jack maybe something like that having the backdoor flush draw having the backdoor wheel draw here in that instance very nice five six the broad two pairs open-enders, pair plus draw. All right. So this is very good already. Maybe also some 9-8. Why not, right? Try to give it a name that does not depend on the board. If you remember, I raised 9-8 on king 7-4. It won't help you that much for other boards, right? So I call it like, it's not a wrap, but something around that. A wrap around wrap around the mid here we're just call it a backdoor straight draw that has good stuff happening folding out jack nine a backdoor straight draw with backdoor flush draw and like a six outer to second pier whatever right then you can use it like king eight deuce it could be nine ten then for example so just a little thing to remember a little better all right so i'll show you mine it up into plus draw board, rainbow board, because what we talked about first is what can be nuts on the river. Those things change on those boards, right? What can be nuts on the river on king 7-4? Either it breaks down rainbow, then it is either the straight that is getting there, or the two pair sets do the job. Okay, we need to cover two pair sets and straights. Easy. If a spade comes, we need to cover spades. If clubs come, we need to cover clubs. And we need to cover bluffs for all of those. So if spades come, we need good bluffs if there is a spade run out. If clubs get there, that will be a little tougher. We need to have bluffs that cover clubs as well, right? And yeah, if the straight gets there have plenty of stuff still left so this is the first things all right jack five deuce rainbow will be the next one there is no flush draw but three backdoor flushes that we need to cover then lots of backdoor straight draws that we need to cover so it will be a more wild mix flush draw boards are always pretty straightforward have two flushes, two potential flushes that we need to cover and then everything else. And the rainbow boards is more like, okay, more mixing actually. All right. So let's have a look. This is my list. We start with the intuitive value and then maybe add a little thin value plus equity denial. The lower the board, the more we will have that. On jack high, it will be a thing to raise our ace jack, to get rid of king highs and queen highs that actually have equity against us. On king high, we only raise a few king x maybe to get rid of like ace highs. But there's some equity denial. While on an ace high board, we are pretty much not raising any of this thin value plus equity denial and we go super polarized. I learned that doing that drill today that actually there we prefer the bigger size because of that. We are not having any thin value, but really go for we have it or we don't. All right. So now next we cover the flush runouts. So we go for flush draws. And if we look for a certain pattern there, it's good that we unblock folds, which means low cards are good, but low flush draws are not that good. So it's like one high card, one low card is the best. Then we start with queen deuce of spades, for example, because that unblocks Willem's random nine of spades, Willem's random eight of spades that he has in offsuit hands. And he takes those as a reason to c-bet and then fold. So just a little, little boost. And obviously we want to be ahead of some flush draws that he continues as well. And straight equity means more not equity. That's always better. On King's seven, four, something with a five or a six is very, very good, obviously. Next thing is we go for backdoor flush draws. There, we need to choose a little more wisely because obviously a backdoor flush draw gets there 5% of the time. A flush draw gets there 35% of the time, right? We need one hit or the other one needs to be two perfect cards. So it's not that important. To take the right hands, we don't take like random backdoor flush draws. We need something going for them that can be a peer, right? We talked about the 4X already or 7X or whatever it was here that was open for having the backdoor flush draw plus peer or definitely the straight equity, right? Thank you. be a peer, right? We talked about the 4x already or 7x or whatever it was here that was open for having the backdoor flush draw plus peer or definitely the straight equity, right? Backdoor straight plus backdoor flush draw. Just remember backdoor flush draw is worth way less. We don't need to cover it that much. We still want to have it. So we want to have something going for it. Next thing is I call it the fake flush draws, right? It's like we have one card and once we hit that, it looks like we have a flush, right? It's exactly what you talked about. And this should be a little more nutted maybe, right? So usually we take like the ace of spades five, ace of spades six, ace of spades three. This is a very great example. It is the first one that everyone is missing, which can explain you why we should fold everything out of position because if they miss that on certain runouts there, it's impossible that they find their bluffs. Overcards, right? So just having some equity. If it's a jack high board, we want to have like a queen high, a king high, something like that. All right. One thing that is another nice addition is the bottom pair plus a clean kicker. What I mean with a clean kicker is that if we hit that, we make a nutted hand. It's not that villain makes a straight or so on. King 7-4, that would be the lowest ones, like 4-deuce sounds great. 4-3, 4-5 is also good. We add some backdoor straight equity and villain doesn't really have those straights that get there when we make two pairs. So it's still very strong, but we don't go for like a king 7-4. I, this is okay, but let's say different board, king 10 seven. We definitely don't go for seven six. Ravillon makes the nine eight straight when we make a two pair. Or we definitely don't go for jack seven. No, hell no. That two pair wouldn't be worth anything. And then obviously we go for the open enders and gut shots and we need those in every range. It's like a frequency thing, especially have those hands off suit all right let's now go through that list having gto wizard open a clean kicker which isn't an overcard is this to get coverage on the lower card runouts because overcards are better versus two pair well important is that villain is not improving to better two pair if we raise for example ace four here and turn our ace villain has all the ace kings here it's like if we hit a deuce there are not many better two pairs villain does not have king seven offsuit necessarily definitely not king four only suited that's more the point if we think about the high cards there will be a thing where we think about high cards as well it's more about right if we have ace four we want to keep all his ace x in and then hit an ace and think about his one pair hands that he has way more than different it gets when a villain has like lots of offsuit hands like that that will continue so for example ace seven is cool here villain will call lots of seven x that we actually have beat while we fold out something like nine ten so a7 is an optional race here as well okay let's go step by step though. Let's start with the intuitive value. Pocket fours, pocket sevens, just a mix. We need those for the brick runouts after calling as well. King seven suited, king seven offsuit, seven four suited. None of that 100%. Now exploitative thought, if your opponent flops seven four here and faces a small c-bet, what is he doing? He's raising. And I'm not asking this one because i know it he's raising 100% of the time so we found again a reason to overfold because villain is value heavy just because he raises more than he should with value heads which can show you if you want to really go for that game tree and you want to raise all your two pairs as well you see like king 7 just 50% of the time maybe 60 if you up that to that to 100 frequency and the sets you can actually raise way more and up all the other frequency as well so now let's go to the next flush drops let's have a quick look what's going on here let's go to spades and hmm what's the thing here like there's not much going on we just need to cover it there's not one hand like okay straight equity like adding a gut shot The seven X, yeah, whatever. On other boards, it's really that we see we take the high card plus low card. Here, it's a little interference because the five six has the added equity here with the straight. Poker bro, it is only important if villain is good enough to go after you on brick charts. If there is a deuce on the turn, he should overbet with ace king, aces, bles bluffs and so on and then actually it maximizes your value to call right instead of raising and then getting the folds so if you you're indifferent but it's like what i do on lower stakes for everyone who's really playing lower stakes and that counts like 500 and below if not even higher stakes as well i recommend everyone take care of the pot size yourself. So I don't think that trapping is good. If you play under NL50, it is an absolute disaster to trap your sevens here. Villains are not good enough to understand the spots where they should put a lot of pressure on you. They won't use big enough sizes. They won't get the money in. So you are responsible for building the pot. And this is what you want to do. Beating lower flushes and unblocking falls. Can you get back on the flush draws? One high card, one low card. Why? That is best exactly. I looked at some other boards as well here. It doesn't seem to be the case because there's lots of interference, right? Let's just look at the ace high flush draws. Ace deuce of spades should be the highest here to raise because first of all, well, every nut flush draw is the best, but a deuce has no value. Sometimes hitting a six still has some value. So it's okay to keep villains range wide here. Hitting a 10 is pretty good already, right? Then the second thing is when we go to lower hands, what is villain C betting? I'll just go back to that. We think about villains bet folds. Jack 10, he's betting those with spade way more often, right? This is what we are unblocking. And therefore we have actually a higher falling frequency. If we raise something like jack nine of spades, obviously, well, we block all those hands that could bet fold. We block all those hands so on that's like a very very tiny thing not important what we need to really remember is okay regarding spades we need to cover the flushes and then you can make your rule i'm way more strict with that i always take ace two and ace three and pretty much never those and here it's like yeah usually it would be a more clear pattern, as I said, if this is a higher board, because now five, six get the little upgrade because of the backdoor straight and two, three get that downgrade because of that, because we cover a queen high flush draws already. But it does not really matter, right? It's just, as I said, you can just say I take all jack high draws, or you can say to yourself, every time you have a random flush draw, you just randomize and raise it 25%. Just have a look. I just filtered for flush draws only, and this is like 25% raising. All right. So now, next thing, backdoor flush draw. We want to cover that. We see already, instead of 25%, we only go for like 10% raises here. And what are we going for here is, again, those with backdoor straight and especially the pairs. Four deuce suited, four three suited, six four suited, four five suited. This year with a little something going on as well. But it's just not a good call, the five deuce of clubs, but it's like has has some potential we are not going for random ace high clubs we can take some of the top pairs we're not going for a random queen high that has nothing going for it we can take something again like this year just slightly too weak to call maybe can turn nice gut shots so way way way more selective with the backdoor flush draws right right? Just randomly 25% with the flush draws, looking at that overall. And this year just taking something on top, going for it. Kind of easy, actually. All right. So now we covered the flush suits in a way. Now let's see. Okay. We had spades. We had clubs. Let's go for, what about hearts? Which suited hearts are raising? This is only two only two pairs two pair some of the gut shots and some of those bottom pairs that's it at hearts five percent knowing something that we take the lowest bottom parent out of our calling range and raise it is maybe a cool idea this year is the value we won't miss that and that's cool right this year as a frequency gut shot is cool so there's nothing to miss this is why i divide and conquer step by step now we covered everything hearts and diamonds is the same and now we are at offshoot hands offshoot hands with high card spade and offshoot hands make your frequency right so offshoot hands is really what makes your raising frequency this is now important important. And what we see high, high, high frequency is exactly what we talked about. Ace, three with the ace of spades. Actually, ace, three with the three of spades as well. Ace, five. Both. One spade enough. Go for it. Ace, seven. This is now interesting because villain has quite some seven X. It's like a value merge because seven X wants to deny equity. It's a big success if Villain folds jack 10. We still have equity if Villain calls a king and Villain calls every seven. So it's okay, right? We will check back a lot. Then, okay, some random top pairs. It's okay if we have spades. It's like little boost but we don't really need it and then what i think jerome said before is those here those hands that fold out dominating hands we've just seen how villain c beds like jack 10 10 9 with one spade so this year is somehow too strong to fold it's actually a cool race right just mixing that in backdoor straight plus backdoor flush plus over cards against the middle pair actually something like seven six we can put in here only with a spade regarding offsuit draws here open ender with a spade five four with a spade can be cool so yeah damien i'm. Everyone is missing those. And now it's, again, you see how many nuts we still slow play. If we take all our nuts, we are allowed to up the frequency of our bluffs as well, which means we just select to play this game tree more often. And now if you think about which game tree are people playing worse, usually the one they don't play as often so here after calling now out of position or let's have a look what they should do after raising even those re-raises they don't exist makes our raising way better and yeah then the turn huge chance for over folding or just wrong adjustment right just randomly jamming stuff or i don't know so this year is very very good. With the bottom pair plus clean kicker, we talked about that already. Open enters got shot with some frequency. And this is everything. I think we covered everything. But maybe this part, the 10-8, 10-9, I did not really write down here. Offsuit and some frequency. It's kind of important. It's those random add-ons that make villains life tough. if villain is over c betting you start printing money okay so now i want to know two strategies of you guys let's talk about the turn now because everyone has that raising range now in their mind and now villain calls and we get a turn i say there are two main strategies on the turn really write it down in the chat strategy one and strategy two. What do you think are the two strategies and on what do they depend? So really strategy one, tell me like one sizing, maybe tell me high frequency, low frequency, strategy two, other sizing on this type of cards. We've already seen what we want to do on the three of hearts. On the three of hearts, we are actually overbetting 50% of our range and not really using any other size. Christian said overbet and block. Block means small bet, I guess. Block bet, I only use this term out of position because it kind of blocks Willen from making a big bet himself. But in position, we have the option to check back. On low card, overbet, high card, check. Okay, check. I didn't even think about that as an option. Strategy one, 35% small bet strategy two, polar overbet. Okay, so I'll tell you how I remember it. I'm working on this myself. It's a very tough game to start with the correct raising range, but I'll start with the easy one. The easy one where everyone makes new nuts is flush. And this is the one where we cannot go big. Flush boards, we never want to go big until the river where we can super big overbet jam. Deuce of spades, this year I can tell you the strategy. We go kind of small in position, which is half pot. Deuce of spades, villain is probably not donking. We have our spades. We have our fake flushes. And there's 20 big blinds in the middle. And the the main sizing here is 10 big blinds just think about how much pressure we put on villain even with that half pot sizing villain has a seven villain has a king and no spades villain has something like five six or even six eight of clubs he can't do anything and then on that river we can polarize a little more and have our 25 all in and thenbet. That's kind of the one plan for flush cards where everyone makes nuts. Pretty much the term for like, it's not just flush card, but when both people improve to lots of new strong hands. The good thing on that board is there is no other card where both players improve to lots of strong hands. If the straights get there, it's only suited stuff. No one really has has it that much so every other card is pretty much a brick we had the three of hearts let's go for the deuce of hearts now it's the same and this is the polar directional and this year 25 boom let's go sevens king queen is indifferent because it's not really going to directional and it's, yeah, we attack other top pairs and accept that we sometimes run into a better hand. And yeah, everything else is kind of intuitive. We take those flush draws that want to fold out better flush draws, like 10-3 of spades. We take the turn 4 deuce. We have new nuts, right? We can take the 4-3 with a set blocker and actually being ahead of nut flush draws that are calling. So kind of a merge value bluff, folding out 7x. We can take, obviously, our fake flush draw, ace-5 with the turn gutshot now. Ace-3, awesome, right? Now, if you think about if you don't have those, it's impossible, really absolutely impossible that you find enough bluffs. All the bullshit, we're not doing anything. We don't need to be crazy. We just prepared well for correct turn cards. And this bullshit here is nothing, nothing, nothing. We obviously don't do anything. Show you another card, 10 of hearts, maybe a little better card for out of position, adding better two pairs with the king 10 that he has all the time. And this is why we size down a little, but still it's polarized. You see some of the overbetting, some three quarter. It's still, I call it a polarized plan. And we see, okay, what are we doing here? Eight, nine, okay, can go for it, but wants to realize equity as well. Something like Jack nine, Queen nine can go a little for it. The 10X obviously checks back. checks back again ace three is still a good one just having that ace of spades or just this year with an overcard is cool we have the gut shots going some open enders and again the low flush draws so kind of a plan just reading the chat give me a second on blank we bet polarized sizing on completing we have smaller size and continue with more intuitive hands. Absolutely. Will depend on turn card or flush cards and high card where they make new nuts. We don't want to go too big. Exactly. Putting those together already for nevermore. Flush card gives him lots of nuts. High cards like this 10 give them a new set and new two pairs that beat our value, two pairs from the flop. This is why we go three quarters instead of 125. For me, i call that still a polarized game plan maybe go even crazier and add that ace this one here and then it's maybe it will be still polarized right but then it's more like 15 because villain can build a re-raising range with all his ace kings so maybe it's a little too much to call it like all polarized but it's really about how many new nuts does villain add as always. And that means like flush, we need to go down to half. This year means three quarters. But if you do this year, it's fine also. Exactly French money. You nailed it. Can we think about it as with our value raise from the flop, top pair, two pair, we are now beaten by flush and can't continue too big to not value cut. Exactly. Why is 10x obviously a check back? Because it beats all 7x and we have showdown value once we turn to 10. We do not try and take second pair to move him off third pair. Okay. So we already have a follow-up plan. Now I go to the turn slide first, and this is now how I wrote it down. We have one main question on the turn. There's no crazy small betting. There's no crazy whatsoever. We either polarize or not. And how much we can do that depends on how much did villain improve. Did the board change? Then we want to keep our range together. We want a small leash, like half pot at our two pairs, as well as our sets and our flushes, we can still polarize river and overbed jam. Is the turn card a brick we clearly polarize we have it or we don't we max pressure on villain right and this could be like that deuce example or the three where we really go for overbet only with 40 50 frequency depends on how good the card is for us the pair port port is special we'll look at that one next now i quickly want to go through the cornerstones of the rainbow board it's very very similar here it's just well we need to cover three backdoor flush draws but we miss the flush draw so it's easy that we do not race enough here and that brings us back to the kind of random hands that are mainly built around over cards plus backdoor straight that we need to have to raise enough here, right? Or something like Jerome's 10, 8, 8, 9 on King 7, 4. Something like that where just good stuff is happening. We just have an addition backdoor straight, probably not backdoor flush here, something like that. So here I added like over card plus backdoor straight. I want to quickly show it, but then want to focus on the another type of board because it's the cooler one. This here is very, very similar to the King 7-4 because we learned about what kind of hands we want to use for our backdoor flush draw. And here we just have the same thing, just three times. Villains should bet small, but not too often. We see 50, 50 more or less, and then we can kill him here. It's a lower board. We add this thin value, right? because we need to deny some equity. Ace jack wants to get rid of like random king highs and queen highs. There is a success in raising that. And then the same for our backdoors, straight equity is good. Overcard equity is good. King four, king three, queen four, queen three, very, very good. And the random addition that everyone is missing, queen 10, queen nine, king 10, something like that, where we use suits to navigate, but nothing else. It's just more or less random hand to have bluffs because if we don't have that, it will be tough on runouts to find bluffs right there is a backdoor diamonds coming we need the offsuit diamonds there is backdoor hearts coming we need offsuit hearts and so on these are the hardest to find and pull off right also backdoor straight right they have over card plus backdoor straight exactly we are not taking random king eight the more gut shots we can turn the better right so king 10 the queen is an open ender like ace is a gut shot right while three four gets there an ace is not too bad actually right what else a nine is a gut shot plus over card so something to work with we definitely cannot fold those hands if not we are crazy over folding again you can see maybe from the other perspective it's super easy to over-fold or to let out of position realize all the equity. A bit less raising with club comms because we unblock more continues. Exactly. Any thoughts on why not king-queen? Like just double check on Dylan's folding range. This is what we are folding out. We don't want to fold that out with king-queen. When we have king-nine or queen-ten, it's like, yes, we want to fold that out. Partly at least. Okay, again partly at least okay again ace three ace four this time it's gut shots and the best mid pair top kicker is just something that works pretty nicely a six year being an option as well just always those offsuits say aces use them as some kind of joker they have their nice ace of something that can navigate flush turn cards or flush draw turn cards. So very, very nice here. Then I want to look at a paired board. Our paired board is 9-9-deuce. Again, now we do a quick, like a super fast challenge. Everyone is allowed to write one hand. One non-intuitive hand you want to be raising on 9-9-deuce. Everyone is allowed to write one hand only in the chat. I't know pocket threes all right here we go i just want to test you and see which categories will be missing check 10 is not intuitive no so that counts 10 8 4 3 right here we go ace deuce all right 6 7 interesting 7 8 suited if we didn't three bad okay why don't we get some bullshit in here right because we are obviously raising some nine x king three suited now here we go what the fuck i'm not sure whether that is one but actually it is one pretty cool we find a variety of things and now if you take a screenshot of that chat you see exactly the raises that all your opponents were the last month. And they will miss those the next month as well. And we are not one of them. Okay? So now, next little challenge is tell me the raising frequency we should have against a small c-bet on 9-9-deuce. 25, 30, 26, 30. Nathan, let's freaking go. 35, 18, 30, 30. 50 is crazy. 40 is crazy as well. Then I think you guys are after my next question, like definitely not that much. But if you think about that villains are not re-raising and probably not playing back enough with calling and probably over C-betting the board. I mean, this board, you can bet full range, so it's tough to over C-bet. that how much raising would you like to do and now let's first double check villain he can do lots of betting right there's not a single hand that really needs to check maybe king eight check fold but it's okay and so we get to at least 23 percent raise and now let's just double check on your hands what did we have here jack 10 sure almost 50 percent right pocket threes sure give it a 50 percent 10-8 offsuit why not right 4-3 of hearts yeah you don't need to be that specific we just take the freaking 4-3 7-8 of spades 100 never missed that one right deuce four sure we flopped two pair ace deuce absolutely don't miss that one 10-8 suited again ace deuce again six seven oh we should three bet we missed the three bet but now i think you can make up for it by raising now six deuce another two pair but okay not that great still it can't hurt right it can't hurt king three suited sabarino showing us the the plan here like just call it we have a freaking king high backdoor flush draw awesome crushing and then we see the 2025 would have been like i think the number i count is perfect here but now let's have a look at villains reaction first of all villain is giving up a lot of stuff here while your villains are just adding everything so it's likely they are overfolding to think about you have a bluff 15.5 villain is re-raising and you're folding this is not happening definitely not with ace king definitely not with king seven suited definitely not with king five suited so just think about your hands all your hands have equity start with first goes for pocket threes and does not face the re-raise with king seven suited. He does not face the re-raise of ace king. How is that not freaking making money? I mean, especially on that three turn we see here, it's making money. But anyways, this has to be freaking good, right? So this is now, I give you lots of reasons to go crazier than you should, pile-wise or gto wizard-wise. Again, I made that paint game a lot already. We often think about it as like, say, starting line, finish line. Like we are kind of here. This is kind of the starting line of raises. Value only starting line. This is what people are doing. No one misses their ace nine, king nine, whatever, with some frequency. Now what we do is we learn that GTO is somewhere here. And what everyone tries to do is we want to up our frequency. We want to get there. Maybe this is what we do. We want to go there. And here is where we stop and say, like, now we are the genius players. We are the best in the world. And now we crush everything, which is not perfect. Because what we should do is now we should understand that and should decide, do we go in that direction or do we go in that direction? Why no one is playing here? No one, right? Just raise every hand you continue. I bet it's a freaking good strategy on everything below NL50. You raise every hand you want to continue. It's freaking crushing. 100%. You get so much overfalls and over equity realization. If you don't mess up on later streets, you're freaking crushing it. Okay, cool. So I hope you got that. And now the toughest question of the day. What is our main turn sizing after villain called and we get a brick turn i give you a hint look at the offsuit part and think about how protected is villain i still see lots of nine eggs and maybe in reality they are not fast playing those here too often as well so villain is protected so all the overbats are not an option not at all we are not polarizing and say like we have line can we go for stacks with nine eight my answer is no villain has all the better offsuit nine x large bet is not an option how are we attacking this calling range the best he has random over cards with backdoor flush draw he has ace highs that didn't get there right so i said it's a brick it's not a high card he has low pairs and he's still nutted so there's only one sizing that makes sense william checks to us and this is our follow-up and i'll think about how tough again is it to react to that if you bet big here actually villain is not making a big mistake just continuing with a nine it's like slight over folding okay but blockers are so big he has a nine when you are bluffing when you have a nine he's just folding he doesn't have a nine so here this is how you put things together right you raise small i told you now as an experiment we could do that 100 of our continuing range on stakes. And then you follow up with that turn bullshit bet. Again, to not overfold, he needs to call quite a lot, right? And then obviously what happens now, everyone all together, like you can sing together pretty much what we do on the river, on the brick. River is the freaking jack. Now we say we have a nine or we don't, right? Okay't right okay villain could dunk 10 but he won't do that for now and now we say we have a freaking nine it's still not all in right because villain is still protected but we make him indifferent the weaker nines go like 29 like pot and the better nines go like 150 and well make villains weaker nines indifferent not really indifferent indifferent nine has to call a blocker thing but still that's how we get the most out of that and just find a new way or a game tree where we can really kill villain if villain overfold the flop we don't have a value bet with all those thin values with deuce x with 4x with pocket threes and we need check instead. Then we made our money on the flop and shouldn't invest anything on the turn. Then villain sits on over pairs and nine X, and we don't want to attack that. Then we can actually maybe even check back some middle-ish nine X and start over betting directional in or betting directional in with ace nine, king nine plus. All right, but I want you guys to understand that. Okay, how our range is is what can we do to kind of give villains trouble it's not always the big bets and here the pair board is kind of a special and very very important to have those unintuitive you did a great job putting it here in the chat now we need to do a great job to put those into play on the table right we need to freaking find our jack ten off suits here right our queen jack off suits it's like there's no freaking hand is wrong to be honest everyone is calling ace four no one is raising but isn't that doing better like maybe sometimes villain folds just ace eight and the next time he's pissed and he just calls king queen but he's not turning it into a bluff like there will be good stuff happening all right so here we. We talked about the turn play. Now I give you a little hint how you can train that. I do two things. I try to understand the range on the flop, and then I look at turn cards, right? So the turn, and I even look at reports and double check the frequencies, which cards are good. In ace, we start polarizing because then we cannot attack all the ace highs anymore. All the low card bricks, we have that small sizing in theory. On the king 7-4, we would have seen, okay, flush card special, high cards a little special, and everything else we go overbet. Okay, this is the first part, but still doesn't solve the problem you have in-game. And now I do that, that you real life in the praxis pretty much and you give yourself one hand and do that like a couple of times right you have pocket threes right let's let's take another board not the special board let's go back to that king seven four and you just test different turns how you're playing so let's say okay know my raising range. Now I have ace of spades five. I'm raising a call. What am I actually doing on spades? Oh, I know now that my range bets half pot. What about ace five with the ace of spades? I mean, it makes a lot of sense that I keep betting, right? So this is what I guess I'm doing. Oh, looks good. Lots of betting, right? With a half Perfect. perfect what about a ace i think no need to deny equity value not that clear i mean some value indifferent maybe but i would mainly check because over betting is a stretch yeah ace five oh indifferent it's like betting is not wrong we get paid by something but it's like not a real value bet to go directional in. So it's like I could, but I don't have to. Okay, it makes a lot of sense. What about a card, like a good card for my range and actually for my hand as well, double gutter. Turn double gutter. I know overbet only. I think my hand likes it. Oh, sounds good. Now, apparently not the ace of spades, which makes probably a lot of sense because Willem is floating lots of ace of spades offsuit, which are now folding. So I'm actually blocking lots of folding range. Okay, all right. Actually, we could double check the flush run out and then see the river that actually the ace of spades is not bluffed very often because we block more folds than calls. Like stuff like that is like really, really advanced then to have a look. But I follow the two things. I look at my range with some reports, but not too much. And then I put myself in game to know, right? I want to have that feeling. I want to create that feeling in game. Okay, what am I doing on certain terms? What am I hoping for in a way? All right, which brings us to the next slide. So this is how I do it. Two steps, reports, and then think about hands and try different turns and double check on your strategy. All right, exploitative thoughts. Exactly pretty much what DLM or DIM, I'm not sure, the oversea bed, especially your population, should make it comfortable for us to up the pressure, which is already high at equilibrium, but we could go crazier, lots of pressure on a wide and weak range. People who are not very good at poker cannot handle that. They make mistakes in either that direction or that direction, but all mistakes they make are good for us. Exploitive thoughts is that I love to overbluff trade off boards and wide seabeders, right? Because where they c-bet to wide is exactly those sports that look okay but are not that great. King-7-4, Jack-5-2 as examples. I'm not exploiting them on King-Jack-4 where it's actually okay if they bet everything. And now I put myself into villain's shoes or like in the small blind's shoes. I want to understand which bluffs people are likely missing to then make great overfolds. I know they are not bluffing enough, but I want to understand which bluffs because then I know on which runouts they have trouble. People are raising with straight draws, but do they have on nine, nine deuce, do they have jack 10 and 10, eight often enough? I doubt it. Do they take wrong sizings on the turn? Yes, absolutely. And then the last thing, what i think is incredibly balanced by the pool which means we get away with it we absolutely get away with it because the next 10 times someone calls down a race bad bet or just the flop race and it gets to showdown he will get shown some freaking not a 10th like if we every now and then show up with the random bullshit no one will take the big mark on us it's like yeah if we are not playing super high it's not that people make notes for every individual player it's more like okay they know this line whatever it's so strong the last 10 times i've seen it they haven't and they will play us the same all right key takeaways i hope you I hope you have seen, it's not easy, but lots of things were intuitive. I didn't get to talk as much about the turn as I wanted to. We probably see that in the add-on or we can discuss hands and discord as well. But lots of things were intuitive there or actually are. And once you understand your flop plan and know which hands you have to choose from, it gets very easy. But this is the main key. Build your boxes, train that a little, and then you can really go for it. So again, I hope you will have as much fun as I had playing the add-on for that coaching, really the drill where I forced myself to raise everything that is somehow okay to raise, which is exactly what you can do in game. And then you see how people need to play back and you just feel like, okay, no, I'm printing money here. So turn play is often intuitive. It's very important that we know the flop plan, that we know it again and work on it. All right, I hope you enjoyed that one. Have a great one, guys. And then talk to you soon.
