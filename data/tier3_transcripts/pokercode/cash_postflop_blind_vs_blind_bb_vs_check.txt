### TOPIC: cash postflop blind vs blind bb vs check
 Happy to see all of you here. And today's spot, actually one of my hate-loved ones. Like I love studying that one, but I hate it in-game because I always feel kind of insecure about what I'm doing there, about sizing choices and so on. And it's lots of freestyling since it's wide range versus wide range. And it's like really tough to guess what villains are doing. Are they check-raising enough? What kind of flop plan do they play overall and so on? So actually I found out that I ended up being way too passive there and just changed that recently. And actually on purpose, I'm like over-aggressive now going for it a little too much. And I think that works quite well so far, but even more than that, it's just like going for it in the correct spots. Let's talk about that today. And this is our spot, right? Blind versus blind, big blind versus check. So we defended preflop. Villain decided to not see them. We had a big, big, big topic where it's all on the platform, blind versus blind, where I kind of talked about how I split things up into range check boards, trade-off boards, and range bet boards, if you want to simplify. Looking at all of that from the small blind's perspective, we had a big session about check raising as the preflop aggressor, like checking and then going back into action mode, check raising, correct sizings, correct follow-up plans. But this was all guessing game already about what is big blind actually doing. And now we want to look at what big blind should actually be doing and how we can hurt villains the most. I think I go with the flow and just keep talking a little about usual exploits as well, that people are fast playing too much, not being protected on later streets, about betting too often instead of building like solid checking ranges. I see that with like some HUD work or like some database work I do that people tend to still overfold the flop, which means that maybe the betting ranges are value have and their air is just in the check or they are just not check raising enough. And when it comes to like bigger bets later on, people are messing up big time. So let's go with that. The plan for today is this year, we'll start with a quiz. This is why it's important that you all get in here. I'll talk about the mix of incentives, whatever that means. Like in the big blind, I think, or I feel like we have different goals to achieve a mix of different things. And usually we try to not split too much and instead kind of find the right trade-off to fit our needs on specific boards. So I'll talk a little about that. There will be a plan A and a plan B. That's already good to split things up to have an idea what we try to achieve. We'll look at two examples, a little more, and then we'll have quiz number two, which will be way tougher. And you can show how much you're rocking this spot and then end with the key takeaways. So we'll start with the first question. It's a time problem, right? I gave you 30 seconds instead of 20 for the first ones, but try to be fast. Villain checks on ace, queen, four, rainbow. Which sizing is the preferred one by GTO Wizard? I write that down there like once, or actually it's in every question, I guess, and forgot to put in the percentage for like the two last answers. That doesn't mean anything. It's not a clue. It's just me and some laziness. So we have four sizing options. One of them is the preferred one. You should only click on one of them. Good luck regarding bet sizing. Ace, queen, four, rainbow. Willan checking to us. All right. That is a good start. Hello. You guys suck. Just kidding. It's like a usual one that people just mess up, right? So it's the first step where we can learn something. We'll have a look at ace, queen, four later. Don't worry. So pretty clear thing. Villain has the huge advantage. I mean, good thing for you if you just randomized without knowing the answers. You were on average doing better than everyone who read the question here. So that was a jumpstart for you probably. So it's one of those boards where actually Villain has a clear range advantage. He could range bet if he wanted to. We can discuss whether small bets are effective here or not, but if we offer a small bet only bet only we can get away with the full range bet so actually it's more of one of those boards where in position is like thanks for the free card and only sometimes goes for it right only sometimes means going for the strongest hands and then we talk about some kind of slow play ace queen pre-flop some pocket force some queen four suited some ace four and like the according bluffs like five three five deuce four x so obviously there is a zero percent bet button is the check we do that a lot but if we are betting then we choose a very big size but don't worry there are more boards to come again the first ones you have 30 seconds we will jump down to 20 seconds a little later and good luck so who was lucky on jerome here we go machine three four five all clubs three four five mono all clubs not even close clearly one sizing preferrediron, here we go. Machine. 3-4-5 all clubs. 3-4-5 mono all clubs. Not even close. Clearly one sizing preferred. No mixes here. Nothing. All right. This is right up your alley. I see it. Ali, I see the small ball poker here. Small step. 3-4-5. We step small. What is he going to do with this freaking king jack no clubs? Queen 10 clubs jack 10 no clubs even pocket eights no clubs hate their life so perfect board to stab small create fold equity and so on all right i even mentioned it poker bro so jerome crushing it here some guys catching up so let's see that was an easy one let's go for the next one jack 10 8 with a flush draw typical trade-off board something in between which sizing we want to go for against villains check do we just fold out his ace four offsuit do we go huge and attack his 10. what's the plan all right 75 we are trade off board the 50 is not wrong wrong it's size here, some mixing. I mean, the word trade-off kind of shows you already that the 33 and the 125 are both not the optimal ones, right? We try to find mix of like denying some equity, charging something. It's kind of like typical poker situation where it's not clear. So 75 is a good sizing here. Let's go to our own silk crushing. Board number four, 855, a paired board, right? Villain sitting on all over cards in this world, having less 5x than we have. Yeah, interesting one. Interesting one for that spot. Absolutely. It's rainbow for you, Poker Bro. It's a rainbow paired board. All right, lots of people going for the small, which indeed is wrong. We want to make use of our 5x. We want to attack like ace-king, ace-queen, ace-axe with backdoor, king-queen with backdoor. Like, we want to attack all those freaking hands. And we have the advantage not only over time with the straight connectivity. If the board was something like 8-5-4, you would probably be a little more right with smaller sizings. But 8-5-5, we make a statement right away, start polarizing. We we bet 5x we bet obviously some 8x and like random pairs as well and have like the nut equity like gut shots as an addition something like backdoor straight draws like 10-9 and like random backdoor flush draws like a king four of diamonds can go with it that's why we go a little more crazy before there's a card that actually hurts right like a king well then we Well, then we need to polarize to the five. Like a king is a really bad card. Or there's like seven or nine or six or four, which are great cards. And then it's better for us if we already put some money in there. So these were the four boards. There will be four more questions in quiz round number one. It will be the same four boards. So you know already what's coming. The 3-4-5 mono, the ace queen four rainbow, jack 10-8 with a flush draw and 8-5-5 rainbow. Now we'll talk about frequencies. I helped you already with the first one and told you the super big sizing. Obviously we go low frequency. I hope most of you will get that right in the next one, but then the next frequencies will be a little tougher. And let's see. Jerome, what's up? What's up? So we got a new leader here, but still anything is possible. How often should you bet? Now we're talking about frequency, not bet sizing. All right. I fooled lots of you into the smallest one. It's actually like about 20% frequency that we are betting here. Like a green, okay. The person doesn't need to out himself, but it's like investing lots of money very, very often on a board that really is not good for you. It's like, let's say that's very aggressive. What's very aggressive, not necessarily good. Let's just continue with the next one. Oh, Mantas, what's up? Three, four, five. How often? I got you. Easy one. Got to stay balanced with those. All right, here. It's close, actually. It's about 40%. I guess I don't remember exactly. 45 to 60 is not necessarily wrong here. I mean, it's not that it's far off. The never betting is not that good, but it's, it's like somewhere there in the mix. So high frequency, small sizing usually goes a little hand in hand. This is a, well, the first little golden rule, but yeah, let's go to the next one. Drone freaking crushing, flying, drone flying, flying Dutchman. Let's go. Jack 10, eight. How often do we go? We remember we go 75% sizing, mainly maybe some half cut as well. Right, it's actually 15 to 30, like a little less than the last one. It will be more around 30% than it is 30 to 45. Actually, I'm a little surprised myself and I hope I didn't misclick, but I'm pretty sure I clicked on the right one there. It's like, yeah, jack, 10, eight. Again, Broadway, very good for out of position. We use the big sizing. It's not like ace, queen, four. This is why we are not going 125%, but 75 instead. Still, there's not any advantage for us in position. It's like, we are doing okay having like queen, nine offsuit and like nine, seven offsuit maybe sometimes. But yeah, is this small is this small line versus big blind single race but yes absolutely it's the small blind open raising and checking to us on the big line and then it's us on the big blind is the action all right and then is it the last board already mark crushing getting there 855 so jerome's 50 bet size was not wrong either. It's a mix between like 50 and 75. Even some 33 is in there, but the frequency is the interesting one. Main sizing was actually 75. Now full frequency all combined. This is the highest one. We have another advantage right now. We have the 5-5, right? And we have another advantage over time. That's the 8-5 connectivity. Give us a 7, give us a 6, give us a 4. Even a 3 is kind of cool. Give us a 9. We're freaking flying here, right? So if like the board is king 5, 5, we have none advantage right now. Not necessarily over time. So that would drop frequency quite a lot. So here's like everything on our side. This is the highest frequencies we will find. So yeah, let's see. Next should show us the scoreboard. Oh, Jeroen, Jeroen. Mark on freaking fire. Three answers in a row. Tucker, usual suspect up there. And this was the easy part. We have, you can see it, nine more questions. They will be about flop, turn, and river and a little more. But now let's talk about the spot itself first. And therefore, I want to go a little into theory, how I see the spot. And I call it the mix of incentives. Small blind open raises first in. We call in the big line. The small blind checks to us. And we built a betting range on the one hand. That's what we just discussed and not discussed, but like guessed about in Kahoot. And now on top, we build a barrel plan. We want to have a plan. I used the word already, not advantage right now. Not advantage over time. We plan a little which sizing we are using now. We should already have an idea of which sizings to use next. What is our follow-up plan? Which frequencies? How crazy can we go? What are we hoping for? What is good? What is not that good? And this is like, should all be in our head already on the flop. Having a plan makes your decisions better over time. So now coming to the mix of incentives, two very, very, very important things to talk about. Nut advantage right now and nut advantage. Obviously, there's a no D in the second nut advantage over time. That's very, very important. Not the missing D, but those two concepts. It's just like, well, if we are stacking off right now on that flop, who is doing better? And the other thing, nut advantage over time tells you even more how big our positional advantage is. If the board is changing in our favor and we have position, that's just a great thing, right? Sometimes we have nut advantage right now and nut advantage over time. That was the example of the 8-5-5. Straights will be better for the big blind. 5x as trips is better for the big blind, right? Then we have spots where the nut advantage right now is for out of position and the nut advantage over time will stay out of position, like the ace-queen- like the ace queen four maybe ace queen six is even better to not have those wheel draws but out of position has the better ace highs has queens has aces has ace queen and he will have all the broadway gut shots as well he will have an offsuit and suited in position sometimes three bats those he will have them especially after barreling because in position has to throw away at some point some some gut shots so yeah this is something where both things are there for out of position for the small line player and then there are spots where often out of position still has the nut advantage right now but in position has the nut advantage over time added on to his positional advantage i would say something like king five six right the straight connectivity with five six is obviously better for imposition having seven eight seven nine eight nine seven four three four three seven suited all that stuff while out of position well it's king 5-6 kind of dry ish for it if the hand was over like there's no straight possible no flush possible he has ace king he has aces still like king queen queens jack still decent hands having all the sets obviously but it will change give us a seven on the turn and the big blind is in there, right? And this is something we should keep in our mind. And what I just wrote down as the mix of incentives is different things we try to achieve with bet size. So first of all, sometimes it will be about denying equity. And think about already three, four, five was a perfect example. Folding out jack 10. If we have a five, we fold out jack 10 on three, four, five. It's a huge success. We folded out six outs. If the board is ace queen four and we bet big, it will unfold six, seven. It has nothing to do with denying equity. I think it's like he's freaking drawing debt to nothing, nothing like to the miracle backdoor bullshit. But this is not the case here, right? So we see already, okay. Sometimes it's more about this. Sometimes it's more about that. Ace talking about ace queen four brings us to the next incentive. Get value from medium strong hands. Do we want to maximize value maybe that we get from his ace five? Because now we get a huge, like a large street. We have ace jack. He has ace five. We bet huge. He calls, turns the freaking king. And if we just check, check, and there's a king, and it's like he won't pay us that us that much anymore right so often getting the value earlier is better before there are more bad cards maybe the other thing would be like jack 10 8 we want to get max value out of a 10 right now if he checks to us before there's a 9 on the turn where the flush gets there or a queen or a king or an ace he won't pay us anything with his third pyramid anymore so this is something okay maybe better take the value now use our position advantage in that way that we build a pot now and we will have perfect decisions later on right we got the value now river is bad card we check back and still build a decent pot against like a middle pair right so this is where we have position advantages as well one more thing is actually the main thing in lots of spots is we want to force villain to range split. Like this is counting for kind of dynamic boards. When villain is forced to check raise his nutted hands or to raise that to fast play, because we have hands with lots of equity, say like, yes, I don't know, pocket sevens on a board that is like 975 with a flush draw. He is forced to check raise his sevens because a six is shit, an eight is shit, spades is shit, and so on. Like not that he's forced 100%, but people are doing it and he should do so most of the time. So by betting now, we can rule out his very strong hands and then can go even crazier on later streets when there's a brick, for example, or another card that doesn't really improve villain, but maybe us. So we are preparing a spot where villain is capped and we can hammer on him on later streets. That's like not a direct thing on the flop that's happening, but we are preparing something for later. Yeah, that's the first part. Second thing, we have the same goal in position on those draw a boards. We don't want to check back our sets. The problem is if we check back those boards, well, everyone knows we won't have a set anymore. If the turn is a brick, then villain still has the sets in his range or other strong hands. And we don't. Let's say 974 with a flush draw turn is a king. Villain can go freaking crazy. So it's our goal to keep our betting frequency high to stay uncapped as long as possible, as often as possible, because the other spot is not really favorable for us. So it's kind of that trade off another incentive we might be having. And the other one is like horse to do into range split. And the last one goes kind of hand in hand. I talked about that already. We want to prepare favorable river spots. So these were like incentives I came up with, I worked with, and then I thought about, okay, what is actually our plan on different kinds of ports? I went for two different plans. And obviously, as always in poker, there's lots of boards where those like two plans and they mix and you see like big mixes or like maybe low frequency, big betting is one plan, high frequency, small betting, equity denial is one plan. And then there's a trade-off board where like we kind of play both plans at the same time. And then we'll see lots of mixing. Obviously I went with like, our examples will be very clear boards with very clear goals. And then we have to put them together in other tough spots. All right, let's talk about plan A. Plan A for me is we have not advantage over time. And our main goal is equity denial. So we mainly do that on low boards that offer straight connectivity. Straights are awesome for in position. Villan has the problem that he just cannot check call gut shots on a turn. His odds are too bad. If we use like normal bet sizings on low boards, he doesn't have showdown value with his gut shots usually if it's not like gear plus gut shot. And then we create situations where we can blast the river because we know he can never have a straight. This is why straight connectivity is so powerful for us. That's such a big difference whether it's king jack four and villain has all the straight connectivity high cards, or it's King-6-4, and we have everything. Big, big, big difference. So our goal here is to keep the betting frequency as high as possible to allow ourselves being uncapped and prepare lots of river all-ins, right? If the round-out is correct, we want to make use of our full stack and our position. And the goal here is really to keep our range together. Keep everything together that is potential river nuts, that is a thin value bet, that is a strong value bet, and actually does not really need protection given the situation. And we want to keep things together and that will help us a little when we talk about turn sizing. All right, that's the clear plan A. For everyone before I just keep talking nonstop, just write down a board that is triggered in your head right now for plan A. Which board do you play this plan A on? Lots of equity denial, high frequency betting, not advantage over time. We go all in on rivers when there are straight cards possible. Just everyone write in the chat one board he has in mind. 875, 764, 457, 653. Here we go, right? This is what we are talking about right now. This is what we are talking about. 246, 45, here we go. Very good. All right. Now plan B. No nut advantage. Villain checks to us even though he has an advantage. And there our main goal is to just charge medium strong hands. That's something like usually it's high card ports where equity denial is less important. There are no over cards to fold out. I don't care whether villain gets to the next street with 7, 8 on King Jack 4. It's like it's drawing to third pair. Maybe has a backdoor straight draw. Okay, congrats okay congrats right but like his third pair whether he hits or not it's like a pure bluff catcher it's not a high ev hand so i don't care equity folding this hand out is not interesting compare just read through your boards again folding out two random high cards is very important here on four five seven hitting a king with king queen makes it a good two street value hand and therefore it's super valuable to fold out hands like that all right so now we have no nut advantage and usually no nut advantage over time either that means we cannot bet often it's obviously we cannot invest a lot of money when villain actually has the advantage just doesn't make sense so we change our strategy to just very very rarely betting but if we are betting we're making a real statement we're saying hey sir we have something right ace queen four was like an overbet on the flop without having an advantage. It's just, you check, you have a freaking weak ace or you have a queen or like pocket eights or what? Boom, let's freaking go. We do that with a few nuts we're having and the nut equity hands that actually have equity or a chance to play for stacks, right? So ace, queen, four, that would be ace, queen, queen, four, pocket fours, ace, four, three, five, de three five deuce five four x with like clean two pair outs something like a backdoor straight backdoor flush draw like five six six seven right can get something on the turn can can get a nice nut draw going on the turn and this is our let's say like 18 19 that's it right everything else we're checking back and are super happy to not have invested anything let's see whether there's a turn card that improves us so we have like those two things and you can already see if we mix that together take like one part of the one board another part of the other board we will see how like this is i like this image like really how those go hand in hand in a way then we can talk about king six four ace four five ace seven five something like that right and then we have a mix where like small betting is okay big betting is okay you look at pie and actually in the end you are lost all right i think this brings us to the two examples the one example is ace queen for rainbow and we use clearly the plan b we have less than 20 percent betting range we have 125 percent sizing only what's happening is we make villains king queen queen jack queen 10 indifferent right away give them a challenge i love we think about it, we give them a challenge and it is a challenge. This guy checks out of position. He faces an overbet and his challenge is to make those lay downs. Obviously checked the queen with the intention of wall check check or of check calling. Yeah. And then already I like having that follow up. We took the main value. We are not going directional and it's just, we're taking the main value now and the turn bet where everyone adds new two pairs will be a 75% bet to then prepare like a polarized river strategy. Now I want to look a little at that board exactly. The ace queen four race big line calls. We have the ace queen four rainbow. Obviously villain should bet a lot, right? Here's the very big bet used by the out of position as well. This leads to a lower frequency. If we only offer the small sizing, out of position can bet almost his entire range. If you put that into pile. So, okay, he checks this time. We see the checking range is lots of King highs, pocket Kings, weak Ace-X, in between peers that are not interested in betting because there's not much equity to be denied. And like some random give-ups, like worst hands, like a Jack-6 of diamonds here. So he checks. So this is what we are seeing here are seeing here and there first of all for all the people that were answering with the zero to 15 percent frequency you're almost right right but we get to like full frequency if we add those up to like 18 but this is what we are doing actually we can start with saying we check back our range here it's not our board we want to see more cards maybe things change if there's a five on the turn but we have obviously some strong hands and they want to put some money in the middle and create fold equity and this is how we do it attacking this medium strong range that villain has ace queen even ace jack is not a hundred percent bet the only hundred percent bets here are queen four pocket fours ace queen ace four close right so these are the only hundred percent bets actually checking back with full range if i read that correctly big mistake, right? So you're just, obviously we still want to create a betting range and then it's important to choose the right hand, right? Mix some of those stronger aces in, some of this gut shots that doesn't have strong showdown value, right? King jack, king 10 have too much showdown value. You can have like some frequency mix in there, but that's it. And then everything we're interested in is like hoping for the wheel draw kind of. So really here 5-3 we take this 4x as like backdoor flush draw plus 5 outer to 2 pair and trips that's like the best chance we have 5-6 backdoor straight draw and then important for me is to see the reaction that villain needs to come up with no raising doesn't make sense and then folding queen jack 100% folding queen 10 100% holding those peers 100% luck with that. Folding queen x without the backdoor flush drop. Not 100%, but like just folding. And just imagine villain is not protected enough and is never checking ace king, very likely. Is never checking ace queen, very likely. Is not even checking queens for some people, very likely. Aces, maybe, who knows, right? And then we can create a situation that is pretty cool, right? I want to know, okay, what is next? we have a brick six of diamonds should be a good brick will improves to a6 that's about it queen six suited two combos not much so that's what i double check it's like our main plan being that 75 percent bet right to then see again okay we can value bet ace 10 again ace nine is close ace jack and then we split to like really polarizing on rivers right so like 15.75 always interesting to see okay what's the follow-up let's get like an irrelevant card out there like a seven out there and then i guess the main sizing use of the river again is not even all in it's just a non-all-in over bet that has like sets and ace four and ace queen so we need the two pair in the end queen four already being closed so it's kind of the plan that we that we plan ahead on why does raising make no sense of small blind because in position is incredibly polarized you don't want to raise against the range that either has it or is full of shit you want to let him blast his full of shit can you show which turn cards favors big blinds range i ask you what do you think which cards what is the best card in the deck here we go nevermore we have our answer you just see this year this is our betting range actually i would say deuce three four five the four is very good as well because we are stabbing so many four x that gives us lots of trips right so here call let's see we have seen that betting frequency on the turn was like 55 on a brick let's put a three out there and i hope that this is correct now that this is going wild it's 75 on one of those cards so now on the four lots of hands are kind of the same all the ace acts obviously so the frequency won't go too crazy but we are only checking back now it's 65 having so many trips here right so find the seven six offsuit bullshit block on the turn kind of tough right you see how much aggression is in there once you start on the flop so i mean we could go for where is it reports i'm not good with that here to be honest right so we see where's check big blind here so just the frequencies on a deuce Thanks for watching! on the flop. So I mean, we could go for, where is it? Reports. I'm not good with that here, to be honest. All right. So we see where it's checked big blind here. So just the frequencies on a deuce, we go wild. On a three, we go wild. And the queen is the obvious worst card. Ace is the second worst card. Just takes away our value part, right? We said we have shit or we have like something good that contains an ace on the flop. And the second ace is telling, no, no, sir, you have shit all the time. You don't have that ace. So this is why the ace is so is so bad all right and then this is all middle-ish kind of brick cards do we keep betting with ace x yeah like ace jack will be the mix i guess but i don't want to go too much into detail we're talking about the overall plan this is one board here and it's not important right it's just like here obviously the three doesn't change anything for our ace jack ace 10 is still a 75 value bet with the goal to check back the river right let's say there's even the deuce on the river and then we have a clear check back with those and then we go freaking crazy with everything else. Okay, so very very clear thing. Let's get to board number two. This is a kind of quick rundown here today and we can discuss all that. Can we see the check call range on the flop for small blind? Again it's ace x and all the queen x without the queen-axe without backdoor are already indifferent. Some four-axe here. And that's about it, right? Queen-axe is indifferent. The gut shots here. King-jack. King-ten. Very, very, very low EV. If we go 135 instead of 125, they will be indifferent. Full-hot kings, yeah. Cool. Example number two. I chose 8-6-4. And I asked you for boards that fit there well. I read it out. We got 8-7-5, 7-6-4, 875, 764, 457, 653. I chose a board where we don't have too many straights right now, right? But it's same like 864, 764, but more of those. I want to create maximum advantage over time. So this is the clear plan A. We want to have equity denial and we want to prepare great spots, right? It's not that we have infinite value right now or anything. Not really. We are preparing spots. Let villain fold anything. Give us a 10 on the turn. Let villain fold anything. Give us a king on the turn. We don't mind. Give us a nine on the river. And now we are talking, right? So something like that. First of all, that forces villain to check raise correctly if we go high frequency. This is now kind of an exploitative statement where I'm just saying people are not check raising correctly. We had that session going. If you missed that, check it out on the platform. I love that session. Blind versus blind check raising as the aggressor. Building different plans here. We talked about the check call with equity denial, right? Like pocket nines, ace, eight, something like that being check raises here. And we want to deny over a card equity while keeping our range together. Everything that bets here is not facing a largely late bet on a king, right? Which is kind of cool if we're sitting here with something. And now I want to write down the follow-up plan, but that changes a lot, right? So I tell you, I keep the range together is what we will need to do on the turn. If the turn is a 10, we want to value bet our nuts like 7, 9, 5, 7, and sets. But we want to value bet a 10 as well. So this is the sizing we want to choose. That's what I can tell you already. There will be lots of more quiz questions regarding that. If the turn is an ace, we are not value betting our random pairs. Like our ace doesn't need to bet either because it's one more street value and it doesn't need to deny equity. So actually we start polarizing on an ace and start over betting the turn. If the turn is a five, I don't know how much I want to keep talking because these are some nice great quiz questions that's going on. If the turn is a five, okay, I can tell you, we keep betting freaking small with freaking high frequency because villain sits there with his freaking aces, kings like eight X, random overcards, king, queen with backdoor. What should he do against a small bet again? We force him to check raise correctly and we just prepare great spots we just need to learn about the follow up plan this is something where i'm struggling with right now because i somehow mess up a lot there myself all right so second last slide and this is it let's have a look at 864 any questions anything you want to like there's nothing prepared anything you want to see on that board before moving to the quiz i'm just showing you first the flop strategy and then we'll talk we'll just browse a little right so first of all this year 864 we see a high betting frequency with a mix of bet one third bet half both has some merit just bet one third is like attacking just jack 10 bet half pot is attacking stronger over cards let's just have a look like king queen is now already ace queen ace king like just imagine villain needs to fold out ace king he should build a 14% check raising range good luck making that happen he calls like ace five a six a seven a four stuff like that so i think no one is really playing like that first of all small one should obviously close to range check there will be like some 20% betting yeah 25 so it's like yeah hmm it's like not a board where we have a huge advantage right now we have four combinations. That's it. It's like, okay, we have the two pairs, but yeah, out of position S them as well. It's just, yeah, just the positional advantage. Therefore not advantage over time. But now let's give us different turn cards. Let's say we bet half pot, villain decides to call, and now we get a freaking deuce. Three, five gets there. It doesn't change much, right? Okay. Here, apparently we have a a little mix 12 in the pot of like a slight over bet lots of 75 we want to keep betting with our eight all right this is why this is our main sizing the 75 or nuts like seven five want to use that sizing mainly as well maybe a vulnerable two pair likes to size up a little but that's not the big issue right so the small again doesn't make And yeah, we start polarizing, but stick to that size. Let's say there's a nine, and then the river, let's give us something cool, like another eight. What about another eight, right? This is, we prepare, we prepare, and then this is what we see in all the spots. We have 30 big blinds in the pot on the river. Give us the second eight there, and now we jam like every straight, every boat, the good good eight acts and that's quite a lot you see how often we bluff freaking tenant offsuit so this is something that is really cool if we prepare for it because we can give villains challenges they haven't seen that often before it's just unnatural to blast all the time here okay let's let's give villain different card let's give him a freaking king king of diamonds well what do you think our river strategy looks like still freaking 16 all in right it's less all in because we want to value but every king now and we need to protect that a little right so if you bet every king well we want to bet some strong hands with the smaller sizing as well so there's lots of 18 betting 18 into 30 or 25 into 30 but there's still the all-in button nine five let go. King is rather blank. It's a blank on the nut side, but it gives us lots of new value bets that we want to go. We have king seven, king five, king nine, king 10 offsuit. We have new value bets and we need to protect them in theory. On an eight, we just have eight X plus and that's all freaking all in. The weaker eight, not fully all in like 150. The stronger eight X we have all in. And now let's find a card to blast. What about something where that freaking seven gets there? So nine, 10 gets there and every five makes it straight. Were we betting enough to fold out his king floats? Yes, absolutely. We were betting twice. We were betting twice. We were betting 50% and 75%. If he check calls his ace king, all our random random peers print money so let's have a look at that seven here so now 5x people are protected right we don't want to jam 5x because then villain only needs to call 5x doesn't make sense 10 9 easy jam so again we have that mix of different bet sizes here according to our hand strength right we are only value betting sets like and the pocket eights actually close. Like sevens are slightly better unblocking the eight. And then it's like either a five or the nuts. That's what we are value betting. Let's put out another card, put out the freaking 10. Let's have a 10, nine, get there to top here. And the seven, nine, make a straight that will look a little like the king because we want to value bet every 10. Every 10 is good for a 75% bet. But obviously we have strong value hands that just go directional. And again, 15%. I mean, that's like rolling the dice and hitting a six, kind of. Yeah, lots of frequencies. We will see that in the key takeaways. Again, this is a way to see stuff here. I showed you the two plans and then we have lots of things where maybe one more example where we have to mix that. So it's like, let's say a king, four, we have the straight advantage over time. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. So King six, four, let's first have a look. Villain obviously not like trade off board should be like 50, 50 when it comes to betting and checking. If he checks to us, we now have a mix. We have some hands that want to like that. This is kind of plan. A is making use of the nut advantage over time they start betting small here like five three like seven three like third pot half pot and we have like hands that want to bet big attack something like pocket queens right away that's something that wants to get the value right now six four maybe like king jack king queen maybe this is where that mix is coming from they want to play a little like on ace queen four not like overbet but this year and now this is again that how i show it like that that this is really going hand in hand and all the nuts need to be like in either that part in plan a or in plan b and then we see that in a way right so let's say we go into the plan of ace queen four right the plan of ace queen four here we don't step 125 but we step would you mix two sizes in practice here yes i'm doing that you can go for the half pot trade-off but i'm mixing two a little to the needs against certain opponents so there are some hands that only go into the small one never into the big one and if you choose only the big one for example you have to skip those but i like to have a high betting frequency here if you only bet small that works out but hurts you when villain is not check raised and i don't think that people are check raising so the bigger sizing is a little more value heavy and the smaller sizing contains more the straight draws and stuff that go crazy later and maybe something like i like to take like king six for example in the small one that is blocking everything anyways something like that so if we go for the big sizing here and then let's say the turn is something like a flush seven, which is a very good card for us, obviously. But after the big sizing, remember, we're more on having nuts or not like some king queen, some king six here, some six four. We're like, okay, we go 125% with the goal of checking back lots of rivers, get max value now before there's an eight and we need to check back our six four before there's a five before there's another heart lots of that and those runouts will come up very very often right if things are the other way around we started betting small seven of hearts okay everything we want to bet is pretty much two pair plus like the king x again doesn't need equity denial here's where we really start like over betting i would say boom not much 75 percent betting we are more here 175 125 we are now making a statement with our straights we polarize here right yes king queen can still be in there king jack king 10 lower frequency but this year is really really it and then we have let's go with big one no fold fold is boring let's get a random brick out not a brick it's 10 is a very good card and then again we have one clear plan and that is this here so really you see how often the frequency just ends up all in in whatever you do it's really making that statement regarding the runoff when was the last time you were all in with jack three of diamonds here on that board starting the flop overbetting the freaking turn bombing it in it's like we see it like it ends up like being 10 frequency here or like king six when were you jamming I mean, maybe it's not best against some opponents, but still, if you give them that problem here a couple of times, that will work out. Let's go back to the Kuhud. I have a couple of questions. We stick, I think, to two different boards. So it will be kind of a storyline where like I asked you for something on the flop, then there is a turn. It's still meaning the same board. I put in the image of the board that you understand it rather quickly with just seeing the image. So because you have a little time pressure. Good luck with that. I'll try to explain what's going on and I think it's pretty clear anyways. Willem checks to us on 543 rainbow. Which sizing do we use most often? Same question as before. Which sizing do we use most often? I don't know why, but I somehow always need to start with a trick question, right? The small one seems very, very intuitive here to kill like King Jack, like Jack 10, but villain has way more ace X and they have that additional gut job. This is why the bigger sizes prefer actually to make those indifferent right away. So sorry for that. I just couldn't help myself. But if you bet small here, it's not the end of this world. It's just that the big one is even better. Here's ace-seven, ace-eight. Oh, ace-seven is a double gutter. Ace-eight, ace-nine, ace-ten, ace-jack, ace-queen, ace-king. That's like the main combos you want to attack. All right. And what's our stabbing frequency in total? So not only the big sizing, there's obviously multiple sizings. In total, what's our stabbing frequency on three, four, five five. I give you a hint. It's a great board for us. All right. This time it was not a trick question. I gave you the real hint. It's really a good board. And he actually just says he steps always. If you have opponents that don't realize how good this board for us is, then they will have a betting range themselves. And therefore their checking range will be even weaker. And all of a sudden we bet a hundred percent correctly. So, right. So it's very easy that villains are not only overfolding, but just splitting their range beforehand instead of checking range. All right. Villain check calls now our 75% bet. And we see the six of spades, an offsuit straight card on the turn. Which size is preferred now? I think we've talked about it. This is is not a trick question so feel free to click on the right thing now the six of spades on the turn all right so we want to keep our range together we still want to bet a seven we want to bet well seven is straight right we want to bet a seven but we want to bet like a six as well we want to bet a random bluff to just fold out random over cards that are still in there. We want to attack a four X, a three X. It's like another range bet almost. We can almost bet full frequency. We mix it between like 33 and 50, but 33 is by far the preferred sizing here. You see like, if you have someone do that against you, you just feel the pain. You feel the pain sitting there with your pocket of kings. You feel the pain sitting there with your check called ace five you feel the pain with every freaking hand in your range that is not a straight let's actually look that up now let's take the time it's worth it so we'll get first of all the three four five to confirm the bigger sizing we want to use here we are big blind stop boom 4.5 and the three right we see that villains should check full range listen to hiachi in the chat very likely that people still keep betting sixes sevens eights nines tens on lower stakes fives four squeeze their range is freaking dead once they check and then we can just bet full range we can bluff king queen even though it's kind of a value hand all of a sudden right like king queen is really just falling out hands that it dominates but still it can be worth it if villain just folds every time and not having check raises right against that here villain should have 15 check raises he has all those freaking sets still should sometimes slow play that like this is how a range should play in the question it was bet half pot villain calls and now we got the six of spades first of all villain obviously there's not much donking going on and this is our strategy here right not an absolute range bet but the six still wants to bet for protection in nigh equity it still has five outs to hit something more or less nutted against over pairs and we want to keep our seven x and everything else together we can just almost bet range here like an ace four is an okay check back just having the right amount of showdown value winning against other ace highs but seven five and the queen of spades range step minus our paired stuff yeah but okay that is the straight part so we have seen that once i mean we are betting ace 10 we're like it's really i think this is good it's a range bet without those hands that actually want to check back that's it everything else let's freaking go and again we need to see okay what do we force villain to be doing build a raising range first of all that includes bluffs good luck and call correctly have fun sitting there with your ace king like good luck after that again interesting let's give us a river break every card that doesn't change the straight should be a brick obviously this is what is happening we polarize we have now what is it 19 in the middle villain is protected we bet only big with a deuce and with a seven and with a seven we go like sometimes big sometimes over bet that's kind of our plan have like random bluffs and we are good to go very very easy but like really keeping things together that is such a big thing for blind versus blind having the idea of we want to keep our range together we don't want to split our range into check and big bet on the turn for example if we bet big on the turn we don't have options for the river actually is it do still a value bet if we bet big on the turn it's close what about our bluffs do we still want to bluff or did we bluff everything out on the turn that now we are running like just paying off like straights it's like no keep your range together and you can still value bet a six against like villains sitting there with 5x 4x 3x random over cards so it's it's absolutely worth it and oh sorry now i got villain check called 75%. oh man and then there's some donking actually gotta go okay so then there's some donking because villain only continues with less over cards more often when he connects and donks like a six himself but we see the same pattern again if villain checks boom this is what we are doing okay let's keep going now the turn is an5 turn ace. Every deuce makes the straight. Every 6-7 makes it straight. What's our preferred sizing? All right, so here, think about keeping our range together. Small pairs don't want a value bet, like there's no equity to be denied. Villain has many ace-ex. We need to attack ace-ex and ace-ex only. We need to polarize here, right? We need to freaking polarize and start saying here, we have two pair plus, if not the straight. Just very, very easy. Ace of spades. Villain has a range check. We have more deuce-ex. And in position, boom, this year, 18.75. We have a straight. We have a straight draw, sets or whatever, right? Like it's interesting how sevens always bet, getting called by sixes and sixes never bet. But the plan plan is okay, we polarize. What would happen if we bet small? I mean, there's some small bet, but the third pot here doesn't achieve anything. We fold out hands that are drawing dead pretty much. It makes sense, but seems so unnatural when one card makes a straight. This one card is a deuce that small blind pretty much never has. Ace-deuce, maybe raising flop. That ace-deuce is not even an open in these ranges, pocket deuces. There we go, right? Okay, try the next one. And what about the 10 of hearts on the turn? Same spot. Villain check calls a 75% bet. We have the 10 of hearts on the turn. Perfect. Here we go. So to answer French Money's question, because it's a good one here. I don't understand keeping our range together for this turn. I'm thinking about, I want to keep all the hands together that I want want to value bet the ace is just such a card that i don't want to value bet anything that is not a straight or like maybe a set or like a good two pair so really it kills like all my thin value bets if the turn is like a six we have seen like for a third pot we can still value bet a six if the turn is an ace we are not interested in folding out queen jack king jack because like if we have an ace it's one more street of value maybe but we don't need to deny equity so what happens is we check back our ace x check it back and then we check back other stuff so what we want to keep together is just our betting range that wants to go for value and we add bluffs so here on that turn card we just go with straights and straight draws this is keeping that range together and traps sometimes the straight as well. Most preferably the lookalikes, like ace-deuce is a great check, for example. If we had another five-deuce, if we had that maybe this year, like we check a five, we check this five-deuce then as well sometimes. So this is it. While now let's see that on the 10, again, keeping together the range means your other turn. If I bink a 10, I want to value bet my 10. I need to fold out ace king. I want to fold it out. I want to value bet against pocket sevens and so on, right? So I have a 10, 10 of hearts it was. And then I need to keep everything together. Meaning again, I don't want to split and bet huge with a straight and bet small with a 10. This is what I mean. Don't split your sizings. Play one size that fits your whole range. And that should go with a thin value, like the thinnest value. Keep it together because you can still go all in on the river. Don't worry about that. We have seen that often enough. So here, what do we want to do? Our thin value is like jack 10, maybe even pocket sixes, kind of a merge hand, pocket sevens, but definitely our 10x. All the 10x that we turn like to bet high frequency. So this is what our nuts want to do as well. If we bet normal now, like 11.25 here all the 10x that we turn like to bet high frequency so this is what our nuts want to do as well if we bet normal now like 11.25 here with the 10 while over betting with a straight let's say i want to go directional in 2e and i write that down then you have a problem because i'm folding against your over bet and i'm check raising against your small bet so keep it together here again let's have a look at what happens with 6-7 in position. We force the villain to fast play. Again, more of the spot. We prepare a great river situation. The villain needs to fast play here, right? His 6-7. There will be flushes on the river. There will be a 6. There will be a 7. He hates life. So 11.25. But we in position can always react, right? Let's give us a random brick. King of diamonds. This is not a random brick. Give us actually like a freaking cool card, like a 10. This is what we are doing. Everything together, everything together. And then on the river, we make the decision what is good enough to value bet and whatnot, right? Here on that 10, it's just 10x plus pretty much. And every 10 is good enough to go all in. Every straight, easily enough to go all in. So this is a little how we do it. If it's a king, we use two sizings because we want to value bet our bluffs that we're a king. Now we bink the river king. We want to value bet them, but it's not good enough for an all in. This is why we split it if it's a king we use two sizings because we want to value bet our bluffs that we're a king now we bink the river king we want to value bet them but it's not good enough for an all-in this is why we split it up into like this year 32.5 85 percent bet and all in with our straights and mix it that way but we kept everything together on the turn that is important okay so you nailed this year let's keep going let's change the board how often do we step the. Sizing doesn't matter for now. All right. Like kind of a trade-off board. So to answer Hiyashi's question about the ace-king, yes, Willen is indifferent already on the flop with ace-king and should mainly fold that. But he has like this with backdoors, the ace-x with backdoors, and he has those like peer plus draw that are in there. All right. Willen check calls this time a half-pot bet. What is our preferred sizing on the deuce of clubs on the turn? So we did bet half pot in position. Willem calls turn is the full brick with a deuce of clubs. What's our sizing in position? All right. So actually like 75 is not really wrong. You can go a little more. We want to bet jack X plus and jack X is just good enough for 125 here let's have a look actually at that jack 75 jack 75 first of all let's have a look at that strategy here we stabbed 45 percent total a mix of small again having that plan preparing for straight cards later half pot same thing maybe a little big bet as well if we go i said half pot villain should check raise a lot on that board because he will lose his nut bunched over time so his ace jack should be out there king jack can check raise as well queen's king's mandatory check raises that weakens his range he sits on all the weaker jack eggs and all the mid pairs and the draws all right and the deuce of clubs villain takes a while checks obviously range and we have a decision to make. And this is this tiny overbet. Like the 75% is like getting close, like 6% that, a little more of the big overbet. But we kind of split. We even check back like a jack four type of hand, jack six. And we go with our stronger jack X. And they want to use a bigger size while we still prepare like something for the river. 175 seemed too big. Apparently it's not. king jack is nuts here villain is not really check has some traps some traps but in reality even less king jack is the nuts here i go for stacks with king jack if there is a river another deuce could 75 more correct on the turn versus under check raising pool i don't think so because the under check raising pool is first of all betting more itself that i don't think that the check calling range is stronger because of the under check raising i don't think that the check calling range is stronger in reality that's the main thing okay so really hammering on that is pretty cool like here going for the stacks with king jack because this is the point where no one can fold a jack which is kind of right in theory but i mean yeah people just sit on a deck all the time where pocket tens or something like that when they do that and they never have the traps that they should have right so if i put in another deuce we just go for a sex which we easily can with the king jack it feels wild but it's not right and then you get like the jack nine call all the time and villain will look it up and see like i played perfectly it's a mixed catcher while in reality his flop structure was messed up and him checking that board is just always meaning i have jack nine i have a seven or i have pocket tens does 125 means polar range of turn but yes absolutely okay so let's see last two questions we went for 125 on that deuce of clubs on the turn and we binked the six of clubs on the river that gives eight nine the straight how often do we go all in Jack, seven, five, deuce of clubs on the turn. And we binked the six of clubs on the river. That gives eight, nine the straight. How often do we go all in? Jack, seven, five, deuce of clubs on the turn, six of clubs on the river. We went half pot flop, 125 turn. Think about jamming river. How often? All right, the 30 plus, I think it's just slightly over 30. If the deuce of clubs, we'll just look it up. Can't show you. I think this is important to see for the last question. We need to go for the last question first and then we'll look it up and then call it a day. It's still jack, seven, five, deuce, six, same action. But we are talking about hands now. We're talking about which hand to do something with and good luck. Just for the record, which is our highest frequency bluff taking the full line, not only the river. We need to go all the way taking this. Is it the 10-9, the busted straight draw? Is it the 10-8 suited, that busted straight draw? Is it the bullshit king-9 off? Or is it actually the ace-4 off that we started stabbing on the flop? Boom. Anyone got it of the top two? I was surprised myself. I know it's not the 10-9 that's like the obvious one that like you don't want to block pocket tens and stuff like that i think like having one card of the straight i went for speed all right so congrats to you guys first of all congrats mark really good job here but let's have a look at that so jack 7-5 and then we get the six of clubs first of all let's double check on that 30 plus frequency. 15 into 12. So river jam is a little bigger even. And check. Let's go with a freaking 40% even. And another 15% over bet here. All right. So obviously 8-9, a big one. We had 10-9 giving up all the time. Blocking 10s is just really bad. And like 10 is such a non-interacting card. The lookalike to the 8-9 is pretty nice, obviously, here. Here, the good thing is with all the King-9, it's a lookalike to the King-Jack as well. 10-8, not taking that line very often on flop and turn. Maybe sometimes 3-betting as well. So not that one. What was the other option? Ace-4, but we don't step that often on flop and turn. So King-9, I was surprised that it always goes for it on that river. Well, not that surprised, but then we go like kind of high frequencies, both flop and turn. turn so like over the full hand this should be the highest frequency bluff getting there with if i didn't overlook some but it looks like it yeah like it should just show a little how tough it is to actually be over bluffing it's like if you don't find those random bluffs but and sure add your freaking king for suited of diamonds like why not and this is not that this is never taking that because this looks just lower frequency because we have three sizings options on flop turn and river it will look the same if we go like smaller on the flop right if let's say we only bet two on the flop it's another frequency we get the same kind of card check and we still have our king nine going for it quite often let's go again 12.5 here and then we have the freaking best card in the deck maybe king nine still going all right so it's kind of in which way it's going all it's just one of those frequencies so yeah it's just really really really tough to be over bluffing everyone has the 10-9 and the 10-8 with the gut shots and so on but actually the king out is three clean outs pretty cool yeah so let's get back to the last slide the key takeaways is, I showed you some incentives to understand those. What is the key? What are the goals in this spot to build the whole plan from flop to river? Keeping your range together is very, very important. That's the second point. Keep it together using the correct sizings. Go always with the thinnest value bets you have on flop and turn usually to just tell you the sizings. If it's four, six, eight to bet every ten maybe even ace eight so i take this sizing to be protected whether we have two times pot three times pot or one times pot left on the river doesn't matter we can freaking stick it in don't end up face up those people that just change their sizing on the turn it's so easy to write down and then just like exploit them to the maximum and then this river play i added a little heart here go big or go home kindness is very very strong here we play hand strength and add bluffs like villain cannot react being capped in lots of spots out of position we can go all the way if our value is strong enough in spots where we have an advantage don't know why jam king nine because the run out is so freaking good for us that we can jam almost everything just 10 9 it was a a bad one to block. And King-9 is an okay one. Blocking calls. All right. You block some King-Jack and Jack-9. Yeah. You have the lookalike to 9-8. You block King-Jack. You block. That's easy. Okay. So I hope you enjoyed that one. We still go big a lot in the future when Rex sees one of those banana barrels. Absolute cool theory. We just do the same with thin value next time as well. Did I say bluff heavy in a second in this coaching? I don't think so. All right, we just want to play correct. I make this example for tournament players always. Say this year is your stack size for tournament players. Let's say we play real poker, like 150 big blinds deep. This is our stack, the whole bottle of water. How tournament poker players play, and I only have like this empty coffee thing, is they only use this amount of their chips. This is like 30 big blinds It doesn't even fit. It's like 15 big blinds, but let's say it's 30 big blinds. Then this is what they are ready to lose because they go half pot, half pot, half pot. And this is just what they like sitting around on, like to not lose my precious tournament life, right? Instead of using their stacks, using your stack allows you to just put way more pressure on people to add more bluffs. That's it. Like, this is my image for that. The people just don't like to use whole stacks. Using your stack allows you to just put way more pressure on people to add more bluffs. That's it. Like this is my image for that. People just don't like to use whole stacks, even though it is theoretically way, way, way, way, way, way better. All right. So I hope you enjoyed that one. Share the notes in Discord. Give me some feedback there. Any follow-ups in the hand histories. Have fun and good luck at the tables until the next one, guys. And Merry Christmas. We'll see each other again in January for the next coaching.
