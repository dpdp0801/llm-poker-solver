### TOPIC: cash postflop blind vs blind check raise as pfa
 Hey Hannes, hey Pavel, hey Gerut, hey, wow, this is a name, Tautvidas, Taka Tiauskas, that sounds very Latvish, Taka here, awesome, is that from Latvia, Lithuania, Mark, just something just pops Ivanauskas in my head, I don't know whether that was a footballer or a winter sports guy, hey Anna, all right, just make sure to join the Kahoot because this is mainly what it's about today. I have lots of questions. Subbano found it. Michio found it. Blind versus blind checkraising. That looks good. Let's make that a PDF. Then ready to start in two, three minutes. My whole computer is a mess. Hey, Mind Control. Great to have you here. I mean, I will put that on full screen a little later. Just that you know you're in the right place here. I'll give you another one, two minutes to join the Kahoot before we start pretty much as always in those type of coaching sessions. So I hope just like I didn't start a thread every single time now after those coachings, but feel free to put any feedback in, in the way we develop the cash section here with all the looms I'm doing, like trying to be a little more reachable than just having videos on the platform. So you probably figured out that there was a little less uploading with that, but I tried to be in touch as much as possible with you guys in Discord and have like doubled the session to have like the standard monthly session that is a little more in-depth as well as a little more, I call it casual session with a guest or just me playing something. Drink next my name is a whiskey in honor of the queen okay okay okay where is the whiskey i don't find it oh there this is the drink it's whiskey i thought there was like a special name or something to it i want to have smileys as well so hey sharon sunrun kairudi in here and it looks like a strong strong team hereoot. It will be some tough questions, actually. I think this is one of the really tough topics that actually the competition I'm playing against on a more or less daily basis struggles a lot with. Lots of mistakes being made here just because it's so deep in the game tree, right? We need to be checking first, then Willow needs to start stabbing and kind of tells us his strategy already, and then we build our strategy and so on and so on let's actually get started I'll bring that Kahoot back in a second I put it in discord you have the game pin still if not just feel free to ask in the chat if you don't have it so far and then we'll start that in a second and as always this is the spot that we know what everyone is talking about or what we are talking about today actually on socials it was out there just playing blinds as aggressor i think milko just shortened that a little actually it is about check raising as the aggressor and since this was like so much stuff and so detailed in a way i really focus on blind versus blind here the most important spot because this happens a lot with very wide ranges in Discord, I still wrote, like maybe I come up with one, two examples for three bet pots as well, or other spots. We'll stick today to blind versus blind. And everything that happens is just, we open raise the small blind, big blind defense, we check to villain, and he starts betting, right? He might have different bet sizes. That's not the most interesting thing right right now but what in general is our strategy to build a check raising range there but i gave you for those that want to go like the extra mile to do like not a homework but to really prepare for that one i told you okay you can watch the coaching i gave together with fedor regarding check raising from the big blind and i called that building nuts driven check check raising ranges because actually there it's about, well, making good hands to beat aces and kings, like really drawing to the nuts with pretty much the plan to go directional and very, very often. And this will be a little different today. We'll have different goals in our check raising strategies and we'll talk a little about that. Yeah, let's actually have a look what we are doing today. Blind versus blind check raising as aggressor. We will start with the quiz. Then we'll actually have a look at what is different between the big blind versus something. Big blind versus button. Big blind versus cutoff. Big blind versus under the gun. And this spot, small blind versus big blind. When we are check raising as the aggressor. Obviously there's lots of stuff different. Then we'll look at typical mistakes. And then we'll look at quiz number two. Quiz number one is already kind of tough. Quiz number two will be a little tougher than maybe you nail it. And if not, it just shows that there's lots of room for improvement. And then depending on the time, it was really tough to plan that one. I'll either have some pile examples we can take a little deeper look into. We'll focus on two boards mainly, and then obviously wrap it up with some key takeaways as always. Cool. Let's get started. As always, just feel free to ask anything in the chat. I won't screen it like every minute, like in the casual sessions, but still, I won't miss out on too much. Yeah, I'll click on start here now. I've seen 25 before. So that one person, make sure to jump back in. You see the game pin here and yeah, definitely worth it to just like test yourself first. Think about it. Hey, true man. And then really learning the most out of it. But we'll start with a casual question that I always start with in this type of coachings. And I want to hear your thoughts first, but it's not necessarily that you answer perfectly to that question. It's just that you give me some input. What are you interested in? What are you doing? What are you thinking in this spot? Like anything that comes up to your mind in this spot actually is interesting for me because, well, as always, I'm like not planning those sessions really through. So I'm happy to deviate a little and answer to your needs. If I see like, okay, maybe what I prepared is going not in the perfect direction, but usually we find some ways here. So yeah, take your time, put in anything that's in your mind. Okay. First nine answers, just like anything, right? Even if you're a beginner, just like, it helps me know, like, what are you thinking about that spot? What are you expecting? And you see on the bottom already the 1 out of 20. A hell of a lot of questions today. All right. I'm going through that as always. Just double checking a little. Check raising strong draws and hands with good backdoor potential. Interesting because this is exactly what we are doing. Big blind versus something. so i'll ask you here right away like you don't need to answer right it's just for your mind what do you mean with backdoor potential what are we trying to beat actually when we play from the big blind we usually try to beat like kings aces queens that type of stuff what are we trying to beat here when we are blind versus blind villain usuallyain usually doesn't have that, right? We have the overpairs. Check raise withdraws to nuts and blockers. Nuts and semi-bluffs in NL2, okay? So really, we want to have equity, equity, equity. The main question is just what do we want to have equity against? Consists of nut-attempts, strong draws, and bluffs. Actually, the sorting works pretty well here. Like, this is all the same. Nice. Redline play, right? It is a redline play. So we're playing wide ranges. This helps you boost your redline, obviously, right? This is like, instead of being passive, maybe, like, great that Tucker is here, right? So he gave, like, big insights, lots of stats in the stats channel, and I made a medium-long loom talk about it, and he just had, check raise at all in that spot. We're like, yes, he lets villain realize 100% equity all the time. If villain bets, he knows he sees the turn anyways. So this is something, right? Redline play, denying equity, very, very important. Boards where we check a lot from the small blind, like two Broadway boards. I'm not checking two Broadway boards often. this is confusing trade-off board the art is important right check raising very little check raising on range check boards we'll figure out we'll figure things out hitting a board for both ranges low boards we mainly check right so obviously the checklist strategy is more interesting on boards that we check a lot on boards where we just bet a hundred percent of our range. Well, Obviously, the check-risk strategy is more interesting on boards that we check a lot. On boards where we just bet 100% of our range, well, we won't get into that spot. So it's not interesting. So we need trade-off boards and we need range check boards. This is where it's important. And maybe if you listen carefully, this is an answer to some of the quiz questions already. So wide ranges, positional disadvantage, stronger range for out of position. Nothing versus nothing. This is huge. We want to win nothing versus nothing. It's tough to make a pair and no limit hold them. So yeah, nothing versus nothing. Winning this is a key. Equity driven, equity denial, and or pushing our pets advantage. Blockers to top a fill on his range. So this is more like on the one hand, we are talking about very wide ranges. On the other hand, we talk about blockers right away. Like that doesn't fit together. A blocker in wide ranges cannot influence much. Blockers will be interesting. We can prepare something to go crazy on the river all the way. Something like that. Board distribution, villain type tendencies, potential further runouts. Here, villains tendencies, very, very interesting because actually like after we're checking we are first of all in a reaction game we need to figure out what villain's strategy is and then we can react again and take over initiative potential further runouts keeping in mind which runouts are good for us which runouts are bad for us as an mtt player usually polarized i wouldn't say as an mtt player what you mean is actually with shorter stacks usually polarized right because if you're playing 150 big lines deep even in an mtt you want to prepare a range for the turn you want to prepare a range for the river play which means just like taking polarized always means you have some full shit it's not a good preparation for turns and drippers right if you're playing a big pop then so with shorter stacks when there's villainous for example just jamming in position versus your check race with i don't know 25 big plans deep well then you want to have nothing to fold that don't know never seen it all right building the pot taking the pot directional in that's the question this is something we could do but we are not necessarily doing we'll figure that out today a bit more mergey absolutely this is what i meant with that so we are not just nuts or nothing sometimes more polarized sometimes more merged never say never and never say always i like that because this is actually perfectly right just doesn't help us much focusing now on playing vulnerable nuts in that line more. Very good. Something that is nuts right now, but won't stay nuts over time. We want to get the money in now. Equity over time. How the range is. You know, there's lots of equity things. That's all that is correct. Obviously, when I see gut shot, I think of a check raise. All right. Makes sense in a way. How does my value range look like? How can I fill it up with bluffs? Again again we have that pattern of value on the one side bluffs on the other side if you watch the check raise from the big blind video we want to put those together and rather talk about like equities versus something we are having because like yeah bluff like this how you see it doesn't tell you in a way how good are your value hands how invulnerable are those and how good are your bluffs right a bluff can have like 30 equity or a bluff can be just like nothing so it's really i want to put that together to really think a little more deeply about it using with big size to get as much money as possible now on low boards partly we'll find out having some hands in c-bet and check raise very often lots Lots of money when we have a clear range environment. Villain stabbing too often as the big blind, right? Exploitative part, reaction game. I like to punish in big blind by check raise a lot against two small bets on a lot of board. Again, reaction game. If villain splits his range, weirdly, a typical thing would be small bet is big bet is they have it well then we can go after them after their small bet exploiting villains who bet big line is main strategy and this year got in last second simplified strat to betting range one third except seven eight ten type of board so that means you're betting all the time so you're not check raising ever i don't get that one but okay, as I expected, lots of room and we try to find things out a little here. Let's actually start with this here before starting the real quiz. So what is the big difference? So obviously now on the left side, you have the small blind versus big blind spot we're talking about today. On the right side, you have the big blind versus, it's meant we are out of position, right? X stands for early position, middle position, cutoff button. And the big difference is small blind versus big blind. When we're talking about preflop, we are uncapped in our spot, right? We have aces, we have kings, we have queens, we have jacks. So this is something something we should keep in mind this is our huge advantage and whenever the board keeps that advantage for us when the board doesn't change too much then it's time to potentially go crazy right when our kings are still really really good when our queens and jacks are still somewhat nutted well that might be interesting for us big blind versus x well we're definitely capped. We're looking for low card boards where we can make nuts and villain not. On the left side, often, if the board didn't change too much, we have a nut advantage right now. This is not always true, but often, right? We have all the sets. Like sometimes we have like less trades or we have the big positional disadvantage. But usually we have solid board coverage with just having the stronger end of the range. We will always have higher equity, not necessarily nut advantage, but we have it often. After defending the big blind, right now back to the right side, we don't have aces, kings, queens that kills our range a bit. So we'll not have nut advantage right now, most spots, but often, especially on those boards with two low cards, Thank you. kills our range a bit so we'll not have nut advantage right now most spots but often especially on those boards with two low cards or three even right then we might have nut advantage right now as well we'll have the nut advantage over time something like queen five six was our main example every seven every eight every four every three even every five or six just changes the nuts because early position or the middle position doesn't have those cards that often will never have those straights so it's more like check raising from the big blind is a bet to the future and check raising small line versus big line in certain spot is saying i have you right now and i want to charge you if you want to catch up it's a very very different very different thing, right? So it's more the check raising from the big blind is very often a preparation for the turn and then see what's going on here. Small blind versus big blind can often be like punish, punish to the maximum, right? And now what is the most important for our strategy and we will have multiple, actually I figured out two strategies mainly from the small blind is that, well, we need to, depending on the board, need to figure out which kind of equity we want to have, right? Do we need to draw to something nutted to beat like villains flop straight, whatever? Are we just like drawing to something that, well, connects with cards that we even have advantage on like we check raise and we are drawing just to an overpair for example right to just beat villains top pair from right now or well is it something else i can't even think of so in the big blind it's a very very clear thing whenever we are check raising we start making like top pairs and over pairs indifferent. Villain always sits there with aces and kings and queens and jacks and tens. So if we are check raising something like seven, three deuce, we kind of want to have equity against over pairs. If we check raise something like queen, 10, seven, you want to have equity against yes, his over pairs and so on and so on. That brings us to all the straight draws, all the flush draws, all the pair plus backdoor draw, right? It's kind of five outers, two trips and two pairs, but actually that might be slightly different small blind versus big blind. Is it after a limp? We're not limping in the cash game world here because rate is too high. We raise as the small blind, big blind defense. We check a board now out of position and villain starts stabbing. We think about check raising. And now this is the slide about the big difference because what people do all the time the same is just like playing those spots similar. And I hope you figure out already that this cannot be right. Something is different. We have different incentives to check raise with different reasons. We have different plans for turns and rivers where we are trying to catch you, right? It's like, actually not that I didn't plan that, but I have to, I have to, this is not that important, but for everyone who followed already a little paint here, we have a pretty clear plan, right? So we start our pot here and this is all in, right right so this is kind of the end of the road where we sometimes try to aim at and now for let's write that down for thickline versus x we often have spots where like over peers try villains over pairs try to get to somewhere here in that like let's say two big bets in there and then check back if the board gets ugly so what we are doing is versus villain's bet we check raise quite a lot to already plan to not allow him to go here we are green here in that spot we check raise a lot and then we like here's the turn card here we already think about okay like how does that improve us new nuts queen five six is the, six. Is the turn a king? That sucks. Slow down. Is the turn a three? Let's go crazy. And then we have this plan. Whatever we do, villain won't get to this point, right? This is, we want to have equity against his, yeah, kind of nutted hands. Or like this type of hands, we want to beat that because they will be bluff catchers. Where now, this is very different, small blind versus big blind. We might have different plans, right? Let's say we are out of position. We start by checking, Villain starts by stabbing. We don't know what it means so far, but well, if we check now, we will just call. We'll check to him on the turn again, either check call, like we again, give Villain the power to decide the pot size. And often we don't want to do that. And now the question is, what is Willem's this here? Is it here? Or is it here where he's trying to aim at? Or is it somewhere here? This can be very different. So actually, we need multiple plans. We need multiple plans to do something. Like maybe we have the nuts right now. we would know over time we get crushed by villain. So actually we charge him now. We can do something like this and actually go like smaller and smaller. Right. So something like that. So this is just something I have in my mind right now where we see, okay, it's lots of differences that will lead to that. All right. So now time to test you a little. Let's start with a quiz. Yeah, I'm not sure. I think I did not adjust all the timing. So sometimes you might have not much time. So better hurry up. Sometimes I adjusted it like some tougher ones to a minute. There are some easy ones. You only have like 20 seconds. So just make sure to read the question like quickly before there are even the answers And then go ahead. Good luck. Let's see. Skip voting. And next. We start with easy true or false. And I'm saying check raising is more important on low boards. Is that true or is that false? Only talking about blind versus blind now. Forget about the big blind spot. Okay, right? Equity denying is very important on low boards. We have something, Will and Will have not advanced over time. We need to deny equity. If not, he over-realizes, right? So I can quote Tucker again on this one. I think he never check-raised like pocket jacks on the type of like 7-5 deuce board to have like a strong check-calling range, but actually like then getting a 6 or a jack or a king or whatever. And the jack was pretty good, actually. Cart on the turn, and this villain realizes equity can do whatever he wants. So low boards are more interesting because we have both hands that maybe want to just fill the pot and go directional in. But we have that big, big, big equity denial part as well that makes it interesting for us to start check raising a lot. Next one. The stronger our hand, the higher our check raise frequency. All this is only true after we checked, right? So if your reasoning is now, but we are betting this anyways, that's not the point. It's just after checking what happens then. So here, this is the big difference I can tell you already to like big blind versus middle position. Big blind versus middle position. It's pretty much how often we check raise depends really on the equity our hand has against something that villain is ready to stack off, which means at the same time, the stronger our hand, if they are not insane blocker we want to check raise queen six five pocket six is like let's go pocket fives let's go seven eight suited let's go right has like 32 percent maybe even more with the backdoor flush draw to value bet for stacks at some point while here amid set well actually there's good stuff happening as well with wide ranges. Do we want to check raise our pocket fives and seven five deuce to fold out villains jack ten that has zero percent equity? Well, we rather have him like hit a jack first, right? So here is the point that ranges are so wide and very, very strong hands are not interested in denying equity. Actually, they want to keep those hands in, that we are rather check raising those hands that are more vulnerable, right? Something like pocket tens that has all the overcards against it, wants to get the money in right now. So here, it's not about the hand strength necessarily. All right, Kaihuri, let's freaking go. Taka cash game guys on the top let's go check raising is not important on range bet boards will there be a slide about check raising on range bet boards or is that not important wow we need freaking 100 percent here range bet board just means by my definition that we are betting every single time which means at the same time we are zero percent checking which will lead to a non-existent game tree and we are definitely not looking in depth into a non-existent game tree all right so some people are clicking buttons here i see it but obviously when we bet every single time we are not interested in what happens after checking because it's not happening Thank you. game tree all right so some people are clicking buttons here i see it but obviously when we bet every single time we're not interested in what happens after checking because it's not happening it's like i don't know i don't have a comparison to that let me think can i come up with something stupid no it's like i'm just thinking about something really stupid but it's like yeah it's like if you go in like 10th floor in a high building and you think about like how you save your energy for like the stairs between 8th and 9th floor. Well, actually, it's bullshit because you take the lift every single time, right? It's like really something we don't need to think about. All right. Next one. I think last true or false. Check raising is not important on range check boards. Do we get 100% here? All right. We found one button clicker. So checkraising is not important on range check boards. Obviously that's absolutely false, right? When we check every single time, we are freaking interested in playing the perfect check raise strategy. Sometimes there are boards that we range check and it doesn't make sense toraise at the same time, right? But this is still, we get into that spot a hundred percent. It's important to know we are not check-raising, right? There are some spots where we check a hundred percent and then we check-raise maybe even 15% of the time. It means like a total, we get 15% of the time into that spot. Slide travel processing the double negative. Yeah. I mean, I'm like, it's a challenge. It's a challenge. So you still managed to do so. Okay. Tucker crushing. Someone prepared. Let's see. Now I think we get away from the true or false. Maybe you need to speed up a little to get the question done in time. But most of the time, I guess I'm fine. A puzzle. Oh, this is tough. I hope you have a minute. Sort those sports from highest to smallest check raise frequency. So we checked already. We are just looking for check raise frequency if villain starts stabbing. To make it easy, we only allow villain to stab half pot. It doesn't matter. Like it's a pretty clear answer here. So the highest check raise frequency we want to have on top, lowest one we want to have on the bottom. Working is so i hope you enjoyed the replay then can give you a hint one of those has zero percent check raise frequency all right so at least nine i mean this is tough right it puzzled with four so actually the easiest one is ace king five of hearts this is almost a range check for it and there's no equity to be be denied and we don't need to fast play nuts because if we have a queen high flush now well it will be the nuts until the river if like the board does not double pair or anything so we don't necessarily need to fast play that either and yeah super super easy we want to carry our ace x king x advantage to showdown that's kind of the plan-10-3, first of all, we need to figure out that check raising is not important because we c-bet almost full range, right? It's like if we put in pilots like a 90% c-bet range, if you tell c-bet board, if you tell me you're c-betting 100%, it's absolutely fine. If you play this 10% check, you will never get to check raise kind of. But villain is just not stabbing often because this is your board anyways. So it doesn't make sense to put like strong hands that are interested in check raising into the check raising game tree. Like not really. So then we got the 9-6-2s. We're like, yes, we want to check raise, but the board is so good that we actually bet a lot ourselves already, which takes away lots of our check-raising hands, right? Pocket tens, pocket jacks, very interested in check-raising here, that actually the 7-5-4 is the one where we have the highest frequency. Now, maybe that's a little fake because 7-5-4, we are using a different check-raise sizing than we want to use on 9-6-2s. That might be a reason for the slightly higher check-raise frequency. Yeah, this is exactly how you play, Tucker. 7-5-4. We'll get to that. We'll get to that. Equity denial is so important. Willem stabs something like jack-9 offsuit here. It's so important for us to fold that out sometimes with a certain category of hands. I swapped top two, 9-6, top. That's good. You can be happy with yourself. It's like seven, five, four is like 15%. Nine, six, twos is like 13%. Queen, ten, three is like 3% and ace, king, five is like 0%. If you have the top two at top two and the bottom two at bottom two, that's almost a perfect answer. And the only reason for the seven, five, four being the top is actually that we use a smaller size there. We will learn something. How do 99 people have this right? Yeah, it's absolutely weird. Mixing up yellow and blue is absolutely fine. Okay, so actually this is quite a good result here. Let's see. Who are the top guys? Hannes, I give you five seconds to take a screenshot, okay? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. All right. Chaka, Kairudi, rudy patience please sebarino where did you go all right let's keep going we have two or three more in that round so which sizing i think i told you now already which sizing do you prefer did you listen carefully we need a hundred percent here which sizing do you prefer to check race on nine six to rainbow those pictures okay almost right so this is the one we want to check raise huge on because here it's yes it's about denying equity as well but actually this is something where we freaking have it right now we would like to be all in right now on the flop villain doesn't have off to two pairs it only has a few sets, very wide range. And well, every turn card makes it worse for us. Think about pocket tents. Can I give you a little hint already? This is exactly the board that we want to overbet button versus big blind, which is actually pretty much the same ranges. We open with 43% from the button in my charts and 43% from the small blind. This is the same range. So this is a board that we like to overbet on from the button. There we have a position advantage. So it's a good idea, even if you're out of position to just get money in now, right? Play with tens, not against his queen jack. Let's fold it out. Play against ace nine, king nine, queen nine, jack nine, 10, nine, nine, eight, nine, seven, and so on. Cool. Let's have a look. Hannah's freaking crushing. Okay. But some of my boys are back. Okay. Now, which of these hands do we check raise more than 50% frequency after checking on nine six twos? How does my check raising range look like? So lucky you, I gave you the full minute. So do we check raise the mid set more than 50% of the time? Do we check raise the two over cards with a backdoor flush draw, backdoor straight draw more than 50% of the time? Do we take something weird like the bottom pier with an ace kicker, like ace deuce of hearts? Do we take something like king nine for value, just like being a top tier second kicker we are check raising pot size we figured that out last question so we are check raising huge can think about what happens next what are we folding out what are we getting called by and so on all right so lots of people are going for the pocket sixes, right? Going for max value against the nine. Actually, that is not true, right? Because it's like we're folding out hands that have 0% equity against us, right? Hands with equity will continue anyways. So it's like protection against like a seven five. It's not a thing. We want to call our sixes here almost always, and then let villain hit a jack and then check raise on the turn right let villain hit a 10 and then still check raise give a fuck about seven eight let villain hit a queen a king whatever and then go crazy lookalike to our six x might be another idea i think the obvious one that almost everyone got right here is the jack 10 of spades can't get better than that right it's the lookalike to tens and jacks which are our 100 check raises here we fold out queen jack queen 10 king 10 something like that get maybe even called by 10 8 10 7 that we dominate i have 25 plus equity against any nine that is calling that's the perfect bluff the jack 10 of spades is like the most sexy one here king nine actually is slightly too weak to go really crazy i mean not really too weak it is fine but just plays better as a check call and it's not interested in going for stacks ace nine is like a high frequency check race but every kicker is there like a big difference because both ranges have it offsuit all of them and here king nine doesn't need to have much protection really because we cover one of the over cards actually like a nine eight suited is more of a check race here really the equity denial part and here ace deuce again it's kind of a nut draw it's kind of a nut draw that's cool and it has equity against calling range it does fine i was a little surprised but yeah it's like a great card you have an ace a deuce is the perfect card anyways it's just so much benefit to fold out shit right if villain steps something like 10-4 suited ace deuce doesn't want to check call against that right villain realized so much equity okay let me just catch up with the chat quickly pick exactly the ones oh wow ace twos ace twos what the fuck yellow is tough okay damn it is ace x calling so often versus check race no it's more about folding out random 10-4 suited random jack-7 bullshit ace twos is not a great hand yeah folding out jack-10 off with ace twos for example is important don't we want villain to realize to verse ace x when we hold ace? Yes, but villain is usually not stabbing a lot with ace-axe, right? If it goes check-check, it's crushing, but villain is not stabbing with lots of ace-axe on that board. So this is why, yeah, we are not actually folding out many hands that we dominate. We actually get calls by hands we dominate, like villain's deuce-axe need to bet call, and the ace and the ace x villain doesn't have it too often if he has it with a backdoor flush draw he needs to call anyways i was never so bad at this quiz i'm getting crushed here maybe i should sign up to compete with fedor's toughest poker quiz i think something is not clear for me we talk about check raise big blind versus x or small blind versus big blind we're talking small blind versus big blind this would be a hundred percent turnaround out of position position. Jack 10 can work out of position on that board as well, but not incredibly high frequency. Pocket sixes would be a highest frequency here. Ace deuce would never check raise, for example. With a weaker range against someone who c-bets high frequency, we would like to keep all the ace-x in there. King nine would be slightly indifferent. So we face a small or a big bet. It's about the structure. So I only allowed half pot to figure out our structure, right? Usually people split up into small and big, but on that board, actually like half pot is a good trade-off. It's pretty cool going over all the incentives, objectives for each hand. All right. Is ace-deuce unique or is it lookalike with deuces and aces? Not sure if we check-raise these often. Actually, deuces we are check-raising because there it makes sense to fast play because villain steps lots of six x and has them very very often and needs to continue this kills our six x as well and we don't need the lookalike because we don't have much deuce x that we are check calling we're check raising ace deuce and king deuce and we don't have much of the weaker ones ace deuce check raise to get showdown or sometimes love the board will change so often every turn card changes this board so we don't have a plan with that right now an ace and a deuce, check raise to get showdown or sometimes love. The board will change so often. Every turn card changes this board. So we don't have a plan with that right now. An ace and a deuce, we're happy to go directional in probably on some king. Maybe we bet again and check all. Maybe we check now and try to realize some equity against villains all busted draws. But it's not a clear plan that we are having here because we cannot plan ahead on a board that is changing so often. But maybe King-9 diamonds with backdoor flush draw opposed to without having the additional equity. It would be fine if we are big blind versus something because the backdoor flush draw gives us equity against what, right? Against strong hands. But a villain doesn't have strong hands here. Here it would be for pure value right now where it's just slightly, slightly, slightly too weak. I think it won't be a horrible check raise. Just a very strong hand here that actually plays good in a check call. Was just looking at different stack death. 55% is actually most used on this board. Then you looked at a different stack death, probably. Actually, let me use that to have a look at that example. Obviously, solve that. It's actually like we have the plan of going directional and with something like tens right now, even though we cannot plan ahead. So we actually want to overcharge the flop. That's the same thing like button versus big blind where we want to overbet pocket tens. It's the exact same thing. We overcharge earlier because later, often we won't have the value anymore. We load the tree. Where is it? These are the ones we're having, nine, six, twos. And first of all, it's important, a 55% in-position size. Okay, cool. I only offered one because I have boards like that and offer two, and it's just a wild mix, which shows you, okay, everything in between will be fine. So first of all, we need to figure out that big size is already the most interesting one here, starting with, right? Pocket temps can check or bet big. Pocket Jacks, that big size is already the most interesting one here starting with right pocket tents can check or bet big pocket jacks that big or check queens kings same same out of position we will always have those mixes because hands are either interested in building a pot or not and when they are interested in building a pot well we have multiple ways of doing so that can be a check race or a bet right so pocket knights actually like this is probably what no one is doing just like betting it here well because king jack is floating right this is what we are trying to play against that type of stuff so yeah and then something like sixes deuces tens jacks we're checking quite often and this year is villain stabbing range so first for those guys that were really confused about the ace-axe, we are not folding out much ace-axe. The villain is starting to step like some And this year is villain stabbing range. So first for those guys that were really confused about the ace-axe, we are not folding out much ace-axe. Villain is starting to stab like some ace-three, ace-four, ace-five, but mainly checking aces back. So we are not attacking that, which helps us to actually deny equity because when villain stabs, he always has like king-seven. It's 25% equity against us. King-eight, same shit. King-ten, same thing. So if villain stabs now and I only offered half pot this is our strategy so welcome to 13 percent check raising tucker and just having an idea but king nine is totally fine to check race just like slightly too weak that's a trick one right it's not over 50 the jack 10 of space here we have a freaking 100 and you even see that it's really gaining ev right there's a big difference between raising 75 raising a little smaller or just calling falling obviously really bad even jack 10 offsuit is fine here right pocket tens pocket jacks i didn't even offer those because it's too obvious they are freaking 100 pocket 6s? Not at all. Let's have a look at 15x my frequency. No, 13. So let's have a look. 15x my frequency, no, 13. So let's have a look what sixes do, for example. And one thing is there, when you have nuts, just think about, are there any turn cards that kill your action, that makes your hand not strong anymore? Yes, a 10 is not awesome because seven, eight got there and you don't have the super nuts anymore but it wouldn't change anything but if you check raise sixes and there is a ten it's the same thing so you need to focus more on the hands that make a difference for each line that you are playing so i'm check calling sixes here turn is the freaking jack of clubs villain keeps betting quite a lot he has lots of jack x obviously he can keep betting with ace nine king nine for value and now our time has come right now we know okay we have the nuts right now but any club sucks any eight sucks any ten sucks any queen villain is not like investing more money with a jack or with a nine so this is the way we want to take we're now maybe tucker for you especially you, especially because you gave, like, in one of the comments, you said, like, you'd rather check-call something like Jax. It was a more dangerous sport to, like, strengthen your check-calling range, which is just what you're not doing. If you check-call hands on the flop that actually have lots of equity against them, you let villain realize perfect equity and do not strengthen your range at all. Actually, you are weakening your range in a way, right? You're strengthening your range if villain bets and then checks back the turn. But for like all the way this year, the pocket sixes check call, this is strengthening your range. Pocket aces, let villain improve to that jack. That's strengthening your range. It's like no equity against it. Let villain hit his over card, stuff like that. All right. So we see the 13% here with a large sizing. And I guess that's it for part one of the quiz. I started doing that little reminder here for myself. So, okay, let's see. Hannes, no one got it correct. Okay, that's fine. Up three places. Mark is the highest climber. So let's go. When so many combos are mixing big c-bet and check raise do you simplify your strategy by always check raising jack ten of spades and always c-betting large with ace nine for example not sure if i want to randomize every time no i'm actually randomizing so i first look both hands and both lines are the same in a way they are just interested in building a plot right now that is important and. And then first, I think about, okay, so check-raise and big bet are brothers. And then, not looking at my hand, I think about, okay, player type. If someone is stabbing a lot, I check-raise everything. If someone is never stabbing, I'm always betting. That's my first decision point. If villain is really good, I'm really mixing. Like I have my randomizer here. You see it next to my mouse. It's an 82. That means passive for me. That would mean actually in the end would end up to check because I look at it on the flop. Do I bet or do I check? Passive means check, but this hand, once it gets checked and villain bets, it's a check raise. So actually then it's's 100% check raise that would be my line right next one 72 okay let's go for the check raise again exactly yeah ben cb doesn't like this no he does like this but ben cb says you should always find a reason to take one or the other right you should try to always find a reason and if it's population tendency right so if i'm talking about my games now it's like very strong players on like cash 5k plus so there's often the spot that actually everyone is just really good and then i start doing that if i play zoom 200 i actually like check raising more against lots of players because they are really bad in that game tree, Even though they are understabbing, it's kind of counterintuitive. And yeah, exactly. RNG is like the theory last option. First thing is understanding check raise and big bet are kind of the same thing. And then villain's player type types you what is more convenient right now. If you invest too much money by stabbing, perfect. We let him step first, take this money. If he is not doing that, not investing enough money, well, we need to build the pot ourselves with the correct green, yellow flag, right? Against the green, yellow flag with something blue in the middle, we definitely like the check raise a lot. Against something with a, let's call it a Swiss flag, we're definitely just like let's go they play all like 38 one style and call everything uh but are not aggressive themselves okay so let's take the quiz aside hannes you got your screenshot i hope right we'll get you later so i i'm i'm like still my bet is on tucker and good old bitter and sebarino jerome you can get them as well hannes really really sucks all right so let's keep going i have no clue what's next year but let's see it will be a surprise if the check race fails it checks through we overbet a lot on the turn the turn will change a lot like this was a board where the turn will change the game a lot but yes there will be over be overbetting. If it's 9-6-2 and turn maybe another deuce, I can see overbetting or another try to check raise. Absolutely. But it's tough because the board is so dynamic. Every turn card changes something. It's really tough to plan ahead. Okay. So now I want to present the two strategies that I figured out, right? When we are playing small blind versus big blind. The one you have just seen, this is your strategy number one. Get money in now, right? It's the pocket tens on 9-6-2s. If you bet small, that would be your worst option. You bet small, villain calls, turn is any card, you hate your life, right? You cannot even go for three streets on most things. If check villain bets half pot you blast it and check raise pot size turn as a queen you can actually still go for stacks because villain never has a freaking queen and well he has some queen nine but for every queen nine he has like a king nine a jack nine a ten nine an ace nine and so on so uh very very easy so this is the strategy get money and now i call it important to play that is we have not advantage right now this is something where villain does not have officer two pairs for example nine five twos nine six twos ten seven twos something like this ten six twos this works very very well ten six three something like trade off boards like7-4 with a flush draw maybe right it's like yes one part of our range wants to go crazy right wouldn't it be cool to let's just get the jack-7-4 with a flush draw we check raise our queen's huge turn we are lucky this time get the deuce and we can go a little crazy all right play for stacks against ace jack river is. We only block bet. Willen calls ace-jack and we got like 60 big blinds instead of 20. So important here is that we fast play vulnerable value hands. Vulnerable value hands are not good to protect our check calling hands. We want to protect our check calling range with hands that can be erased later. If we check call pocket tens now, it will never be a river race. If we check call pocket sixes on nine six twos. Hell yeah, that will be cool later on, right? So that's what we want to do. And same actually for the draws, right? We are check raising our jack ten of spades. Yes, we are check raising for board coverage our ten eight of spades, our seven of spades as well. But seven, eight is kind of a mix. It's not like big blind versus under the gun. We check raise seven, eight, a hundred percent. No, that's a hand that can race later. We want to cover it. We want to protect our range. If the turn is a 10, if the turn is a five after check calling, we want to have nuts. That's cool. So this is the strategy where we want to use huge sizing. And we clearly have the goal of going directional in. Right now, turns might change things. And here's the clear thing that I asked in the beginning. What do we want to have equity against? We don't need to beat kings, aces, and queens. Villain does not have that. And this is where all those top pair draws are coming from into that check raising match. We only need to have equity against the top pair, against villains 9X. That's his strongest hands. With those wide ranges, we can forget his three combinations of pocket deuces. We don't give a shit, right? So it's about his ace nine, king nine, queen nine, jack nine, 10, nine, nine, eight, all those combos, all offsuit combos. So we want to beat that. Jack 10 makes a great draw for that, having 25% to hit a freaking nut hand, freaking top here, turn a river, plus backdoor straight draw, plus backdoor flush draw. That's a freaking monster. So this is the goal. And that fits very, very well to big blind blind versus something actually where we just check raise our set yeah with the large sizing whatever to your example of tens 100% raise yes this explanation of with what hands to protect the range is fantastic great so i hope that that really helps i mean i'm talking often about those cornerstones of your range right so just knowing i check call my six x i check i check call my sixes i have a plan later tells you right away your bluff candidates for later maybe as well right so um protect with super nuts not pocket tens one. Now, actually, I feel like I'm missing questions on strategy number two, because this is coming a little out of the blue now. But I'm just presenting this. Strategy number two. I call it fast play to deny equity. So actually, we are talking about boards where we do not have nut advantage. Now this is very counterintuitive. We want to fast play a hand that has a certain value while not having nut advantage. That tells you right away, we are not going directional in. We have a different plan, but we want to reach that goal rather fast jack jack on 754 actually 754 will be our board but find a better hand everyone can jump in here has a has a great here we go this is it a7 and pocket eights we need to fucking get rid of jack nine offsuit we need to make it fold we need to make 10-9 offsuit fold it has like 30 equity against our hand but our hand against villain's calling range again is doing great right here a7 is not going direction all in but we want to get value from 7-8 from 7-9 from king 7 from queen 7 from jack 7 from 10-7 we want to fold out jack 10 jack 9 10-9 queen 10 and so on on we want to fold out ten three backdoor right so something like that so pocket eights is actually maybe it might it might it's the best i can tell you uh the highest check raise frequency on seven five four is pocket eights maybe this is a quiz question later so uh maybe not i i don't even know five six doesn't need to check raise like it doesn't want to get money in against queen seven it's it's a joker it's like kind of an equity bomb but it's like we can check call react later it's fine yeah ace deuce i think is a bad candidate just like the out to three is is not good because villain makes better straights getting an ace yes but it's it's like now probably nothing we want. We can take on a board where we actually have the disadvantage. So I'm looking maybe coming back to pain small numbers. This year was our, this was like the nine 62 example, right? Let's call that strategy one. And the other one here is let's call that here we are spread to villain starts stabbing so we check we obviously don't see that because we are not investing money villain starts stabbing same sizing whatever and now we are not going crazy we want it just to attack his freaking bullshit over cards and we know already our goal is not here Thank you. whatever and now we are not going crazy we want it just to attack his freaking bullshit over cards and we know already our goal is not here not at all let's kill that again right our goal maybe is here pocket eights we want to get like this check race in and one more street against his weaker seven against his whatever we just want to make sure it's just we are not really stronger than villains range but we still want to find the best way to play our hand best navigation through it right to not let villain realize all kinds of shit right this is the most important one for you tucker here we're like what happens turn maybe we have another 75 percent bet with our pocket eights river is i don't know know, a deuce. And then we even have another block bet. Or the river is a king. Well, king, we maybe have still a block bet. Or it's something worse on the turn and we maybe only bet small on the turn to attack still 7x. Bet small on the river again. And this is a very, very different plan. What do we do if villain jams on us? Always call. Villain should never, ever, ever jam their imposition. If it happens, you're playing a clown and probably, I don't know, right? Villain is giving up his positional advantage. So he usually just has it and we can fold, even though we are close to price him. We say thank you for bad players. Absolutely. Mini-millions're talking 100 big lines this is not true for 40 big lines strategies are different for 40 big lines again you are happy to get in jacks tens and stuff like that this year is 100 big lines plus if someone let's say we are playing a big pot of six big lines building steps to three we make it nine and he jams a freaking 100 big lines let it go wait for the next spot they're not over bluffing against you all right and if they are you didn't lose much okay so understanding that whenever villains are thinking about check raising they have this pattern in their mind going directional and polarizing going directional and well this year has to exist, blind versus blind, wide ranges, this year is fold equity for a very, very cheap price. So actually I called that, I rephrased that. I call that strategy, check calling with fold equity, because actually I don't want to build a pot. It's like check calling, which tells you right away, my main plan is not to blast the turn if i check call the flop i'm mainly checking the turn or donking small sometimes but i'm not blasting out of nowhere so this here is my check call with fold like yes i have pocket eights i want to check call but on the other hand i want to fold out his jack nine so i go for a small check race right So this is how I can like outplay my mind from that. Let's go crazy. Exactly. Kind of check-raise small from big line eight, eight, four with four X. We're not trying to go to action. It's just for full equity because we can do like actually eight, eight, four is different because here we can check race because we have the eight X advantage here. We are check racing without a freaking advantage, but yeah, it's like not killing us because we get in the same problem anyways. Okay, now I think, let me see what's next. Oh, typical mistakes, perfect. So typical mistakes. So what we figured out now through the quiz is we all suck, right? So everyone makes lots of mistakes, but even better is all our competition sucks. And this is why it's great to be good in that spot. We've already figured out it comes up quite often. Range check boards, we have them. Trade-off boards, we check about 50%. Hillen will stab about 50% or even more. So it's a spot that really comes up. And now the typical mistakes for strategy number one is first of all, the wrong bluff selection. Nine, six selection nine six deuce people going for seven eight all the time instead of the jack ten suited this year seven eight fifty fifty it's okay right people but like the jack ten people see that a hundred percent or like not check raising or whatever so usually that is just just value heavy people definitely not having ace deuce what about the king jack suited random over cards with the back door what about a wall that's it right this is just like additions right yeah then what people are doing wrong is fast playing invulnerable nuts people check raising sixes because they have sixes and they want to get it in people having top two pair getting it all in or like yeah i mean the big one cannot have anything that stacks off it's like there is not much left well at sixes against the nine x they should bet mostly on the turn again so you're not winning anything and you can do that later so yeah that's a big big thing that people fast play their invulnerable nuts or even slow play their their vulnerable nuts like tens and jacks and then one thing i see as well is just that they don't go for thin value on ugly runouts they're like here i show you once we have pocket tens. Let's see pocket tens turn is the freaking jack of hearts. Yes. Let's keep going, right? We keep going. 1 35 river is a brick. Now use of diamonds pocket tens is a fist pump value. This is what I mean. People are not going for that because of our huge check check raise, villain almost has no jack-ex. No, no, no jack-ex. So it doesn't matter. This is something we need to realize. We designed his range in a way that he doesn't have it anymore. We are still playing against ace-nine, king-nine, queen-nine. Well, jack-nine sucks, right? But 10-9, 9-8, obviously 7-8, stuff like that. Maybe you can even add a flush draw on the turn. So stuff like that. Okay. So this is what I see as typical mistakes. Now coming to typical mistakes of strategy number two. Tucker, can you tell me the first typical mistakes when it comes to strategy number two? I think you're an expert to answer that one. Here, you do it with not doing strategy number two at all right so not doing strategy number one is not a big mistake because you probably take all those hands and bet big instead if you bet those then you end up with 70 c-bet frequency and you don't end up in that checking spot yes your checking range is really is really weak and that's a problem. But if you bet all those hands instead, it's like, right, the two brothers doesn't change much. So it's a tiny mistake. But in the spot where we check 100%, then not doing anything, that is the costly one. So never check race is the one. So here's number one, it's not existent. Strategy number two is not existent. Remember strategy number two is the check call with fold equity. The small check raise, deny equity. We are not going directional. Second thing they learned, they've seen to check raise certain hands, but they use one hotkey. That messes things up because 754 as our example, in position is protected, freaking protected. You cannot pot-sized check raise your pocket jacks there. You're running into all my freaking nuts and all the hands that will make nuts on the turn and all the hands that have the equity and will make nuts on the river. So actually that means you're just building a huge pot to lose it later, right? Too used, too big, right? You don't have the goal for your for your hand category okay then the other typical mistakes is that people really mess up turns not finding the right block bets not finding the spots where they need to check especially the thin value is what they are doing wrong and what i figured out that people have the mindset of going directional and again that can mean everything wrong turn play wrong hand selection on the flop just check raising all the mid pairs and trying to go directional and we're like they figure out that like straight gets there and they're it sucks again right we're like yeah they just like pretend to have an advantage while actually they are just having a strong hand this time and their their their, they're, they're range is just like more in a defensive mode. Even though we sometimes want to check race in a defensive mode. What's your size please? And check, research you want in cash and what your size and empty T. I don't have different sizings for us for empty T and and cash. It's just a different stack size in empty T you mainly play smaller stacks. So you need to go smaller sizings for a hundred bigs i go with a pot size check race that's 100 pot so let's say if the pot is six big blinds villain now i definitely will make that wrong villain steps half pot right so he bets three big blinds into six big blinds then i need to can someone do the math i suck at that i think actually 18 is the check raise it's really really really huge if you only play like 50 big lines you don't need to go so crazy because you easily get the money in any ways right so it's cash and mtt is the same it's the same strategy same poker but just the stack size if i play cash with 40 big lands it's more like an mtt thread it's the same strategy it's just a stack size thing yeah three is step i try to use more like percentage of the pot because then if someone let's say steps very small and we go like 3x it's totally off It's more like, it's relative more to the pot. So the other one, the strategy number two here, I use a 50% sizing, like half pot. Just realized that the medium pots have been ignored. All the focus goes to big pots when starting and these strategies are left out. That's a good reasoning, right? Everyone sucks in those. Okay, next one is already a summary key takeaway. So we have 20 minutes on the clock. That's the perfect timing, I guess, to finish the quiz another 10 11 12 whatever questions for yeah i feel like i want to have a side bet with hannes hannes you're still with us i want to give hannes a free roll anything you need hannes i want to give you a free roll if you end up winning this one and anybody having an idea of a free roll I can give Hannes? Okay. Erich Frühstück. That's like a 6.5 out of 10. Anyone, anything better? If not, it's the Erich Frühstück. Case of wine. Okay. Okay. Okay. Baby things. Oh, okay. Okay. Hannes doesn't need coaching. Baby things. Okay. We focus on baby things. Let's go. We have a free roll on baby things for hannes if he if he wins that one okay let's go but i need you guys to to defend the that here like it's just not okay that he wins it okay okay we we focus on 962s again which hands check raise more than 25 percent this time versus the half pot bet just really really meaning it's okay to check raise those. You have seen the sim. I hope you didn't forget. More often than 25%. So just it's okay to check raise. Should be easy, right? We've just looked at the sim. Queen-8 with the queen high and the random backdoor. Jack-10 offsuit time, we actually looked at that. KQ of spades dominating all the other stabs. Another freaking deuce, like the Q deuce of clubs with the backdoor flush draw. Alright, almost all of them the Q deuce is slightly too bad here. That's it, right? The Q blocks the stabbing range. It's like, yeah, I mean, actually, this is, we had it with the ace before. Villain is not stabbing ace-axe. This is why it's cool to check-raise that, because we don't have a big domination effect. Here, actually, villain is stabbing quite lots of queen-axe, so we rather check-call our queen-deuce to keep those hands that we dominate in. Everything else is fine. This one was really here to show, hey, check raising is a thing here. Once the hands make somehow sense, it's okay. And this is, again, we look at a spot that is absolutely under check raised. Understanding that those are obviously not 100% check raises, but if we want to go crazier than Pio, this is our spot. Take allton off suit take just all of them and you're good king queen felt way too strong well yeah check call is fine it's not a hundred percent thing we dominate things but it has awesome equity against all the nine eggs that's all we need backdoor backdoor want to keep king jackington they're not stabbing that often this is why it's not such a big factor we are checking that very very often right so it's it's right here it's just about 25 i can show you again this year right villain villain stabbing range this year what you're talking about is actually not stabbing that often king jack king 10 so it's not such a big deal and here it's like obviously we like jack 10 more we like queen jack more because folding out stuff is more important king queen it's just a nice hand category and it's like a 50 50 thing right but again this is you see the reason this is why everyone is value heavy this is why everyone is under check raising if those hands are never taken isn't checkers king queen suited also out ace-x suited backdoors? I don't know whether there is such a specific reason for everything. It's very wide ranges and we have equity, very good equity against continuing range. We're like, actually, those hands for this reason are not stabbing in the first place, right? So falling out ace-x backdoors, they are not stabbing. Anyways, we don't need to find the tiniest reasons. This is like, now we would be talking on like an NL20K level where I'm not like really feel comfortable even knowing stuff. But this is far too deep. We need to increase our check-raise frequency, understanding what equity we need. And this is a fine hand. Understanding that queen-10 is better is even cooler. Okay, next one. See you later, Hannes.es freaking tournament guy winning it now i i i i mark on fire mark on fire now we're talking about the turn we check raise pot size on nine six deuce rainbow villain calls and the turn is the freaking almost brick deuce of hearts remember we have the the ace juice how often do we bet it's not about the sizing it's about frequency how often do we bet all right 100 now all of our freaking jack 10 and queen aid and queen jackaroonies didn't get there we cannot go with the range bet we did not really improve there but it's still a lot it's still a lot right we have to give up like none of our bluffs improved but all like our ace deuce maybe but all of our value is still value hand so yeah it's like we give up some of the bluffs we check some of our medium whatever and uh go linear with the oh no i don't want to tell you like we definitely bet most of our medium whatever and go linear with the, oh, no, I don't want to tell you. Like, we definitely bet most of our stuff then. All right. So let's go next. Now we talked about frequency. Let's talk about sizing. All our buffs don't pick up equity here. This is why we need to give up something. All right. It's a great card for our value hand because villain didn't catch up. Like an eight or a seven would be way worse. But none of our queen jack picked up anything all right mark freaking on fire what a streak in those questions tuck up fighting back let's go now the sizing main oh fuck i think i messed up if it's multi-select, there's only one thing correct. Maybe it's fucked. Is it really multi-select and you have to click on two? Then I fucked up. Is that multi-select? Okay, yeah. But then it's good that most of you somehow got like it partly correct no not some or everyone got it wrong it's it's fine it's fine so like let's do it in the chat if you guys need to go for one of those which one do you take okay everyone who wrote down 75 now gets an added 25 points for for if it's if it's even because it is actually 75 it's more than 2e it's one of those cases where nuts are not won't stay nuts over time right every jack every queen changes things slightly and this is where we want to overcharge on the turn right 2e sizing would mean okay we have nuts that are invulnerable right if there is a hand that wants to go 2e it's probably like ace deuce like it will stay nuts whatsoever right but something like pocket tens likes to overcharge now because it's nuts right now but not necessary later so he wants to overcharge villain bet a little more than 2e now a little less than 2e later but this is very very in depth so everything in that region is absolutely fine and everyone who had 75 gets a 25 25 point bonus in case there is is later it's very very close between two two of you all right next one 2e barino winning with his 2e we would have gotten a mark you clicked on 75 only oh this is up now okay so you should feel ashamed to ibarino but mark you needed to click on two i guess yeah actually actually yeah if you have to click on two it has to be both of the 67 and the 75 so it's fine it's fine okay What about the king of diamonds? Different turn card. How often do we bet on the king of diamonds? Backdoor flush draw got there and the king got there. We improved to something like jack 10, but our ace nine and tens lose a little in value. Frequency again. All right. So we can bet more now because some of our blocks improved some of and picked up equity some of our value is like a little weaker but actually because you need to speed up johanna because we check raise so huge actually the king of diamonds doesn't bother our pocket tens too much i've shown you that with a jack right we were still going directional in with pocket tens even though the jack was like a turn jack and a river break but here we can still keep going so actually the king means we can bet more than on a deuce just like we just improved to king queen of spades king jack of spades something like jack diamonds. Okay. So next one will be a speed one. You're ready, Johanna? Would it be a big mistake to use 100 instead of 85? Yeah, because then you were probably check-raising the wrong hands. Like you should have some a6 as well to check-raise. That should be just a pretty clear check now. But I'm happy to take a quick look. We're running a little out of time. But anyways, it it doesn't matter let's take the freaking king of diamonds check raise a little calls king of diamonds it's actually 87 i i cheated a little we're like some of the worst queen eight of spades gives up i thought that something like a6 is a clear check here so i actually wrong. So it's just the give ups. So I think it's fine. I think it's absolutely fine. Just like this is just slightly over bluffing. That seems cool. And now obviously you have looked at the sizing, which is obviously the next question. What's our main sizing on the king of diamonds? I've just shown you, just shown you so maybe we get the hundred percent now i hope this one is not multi-select all right this one is now not like that thing with all the overcards from the pocket tens like before here's more like equity stuff going on where we actually don't recognize it's just, we go to the 2E here and actually have to, we can't like on the deuce, like something like pocket 10s, Jacks could jam every river card here. It's not the case. Things will change on diamonds and so on. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, here, this is why I asked for the main sizing, right? Something that is a little vulnerable, like the bigger size can exist as well. It depends on, I mean let the solver run forever but it's i mean this is not a difference right it's important to not go block bet now being scared not having value in like pocket tens or so i do not have 67 that's fine right it's absolutely fine 75 just for me it's important to understand the concept what happens in certain cards why can we or should we do things it's not changing ev really like whether you bet 67 or 75 just not go for 30 all right speeding up a little here a tough one sort those hands from highest to lowest check raise frequency on 754 here we got our board we switched to strategy number two highest to lowest checker is frequency frequency on 7, 5, 4. Here we got our board. We switched to strategy number two. Highest to lowest check-raise frequency. I told you already that pocket 8s are the highest frequency. Let's start with this one. Pocket 8s, I can tell you, is the highest frequency. What else do you want check-raise on that board? From high to low. Don't mess up the direction. And Johanna, you have 26 seconds left now. I mean, hopefully you started with the pocket eights on top. That's a good start. I mean, it's a little unfair here. The pocket eights are clear. Queen six suited with like all the backdoors. Just a decent hand. And the bottom is really tough. Pocket queens just don't need to deny too much equity. An ace as an overcard against us, not a big deal. King, not too much. So pocket tens would probably be there, but important as well that pocket fours are not very high frequency. So it's absolutely fine. Who is the lucky winner in the chat? Who got it right? Mark with a freaking streak. Is that enough for the top? Or did you just open up the sim oh ah damn it top five at least still still in reach here okay we check raise small right we figured that out already versus this time the 30 step on 754 how often do we bet on the deuce of hearts turn check calling with fold equity guys all right i i guess i tricked you with a with a 25 35 options there right it's um actually the de a very, very, very good card for us. The problem with 7, 5, 4 is not the four combinations of 6, 3, and 6, 8 suited that Villain has. It's the nut equity over time and nut advantage over time, where the deuce just means you're okay. Nothing got there. And now it's cool for us. We check raise something like all Queen 6, pocket 8s, A7, I can tell as well. Yeah, nice. It's actually like 55 you see is lower than the 65 and 85 we had before. So this is very important. It's like it is lower already. I just tricked you a little with the very low options here, I guess. So let's see what's the next question. Patience, please, here we go. Sorry, I'm, deuce of hearts, no, this, sorry, this is the king of diamonds as well. I didn't mix it. The king of diamonds is the card here. Turn king of diamonds. Oh, sorry, no, the sizing, ah, I'm messing it up. Sorry, guys, this is on the sizing. All my fault, I hope you do it in five seconds. Sorry, I messed that one up. I thought it's like the next question for the turn because we'll talk about the turn king of diamonds in a second, pretty sure. So yeah, here it's the 75. But remember it was a smaller step and a smaller check race. So both of it. This is far away from going directional in here. A very, very different spot. And the deuce of hearts is the most brick we can get here. So it's like pocket eights, ace seven. They are still very, very, very fine. And yeah. Now, Rick, I'm pretty sure we are talking about hopefully the king of diamonds. Maybe I found another turn card. Let's see. Here we go. How often do we bet on the king of diamonds turn? All right, same thing. Is that actually true? This seems really like some... I don't remember. It really seems like some copy-pasting going wrong. Let me double-check, yeah i don't remember it really seems like some copy pasting going wrong but let me let me double check actually i don't don't want to put anything wrong out there so the small check raise indeed the call and then we have the king of diamonds no that's absolutely right so it's right the king of diamonds here does not really it's like here it's kind of a trade-off we check raise those pocket aids this a7 other stuff. The king of diamonds is not that often in our check-raising strategy. It's more like around the 10x, jack-x and stuff like that. We'll see that in a second. And this year, the king here does not really improve us. So actually the king is almost as a brick as the deuce was. So it's kind of the same strategy here. Okay. Three more questions. Which sizing do we use on the King of diamonds turn? All right. So we have a problem that actually the King, this year, we are the check calling with fold equity. The king is the problem because it improves both ranges. Something like king eight, king six, king X with backdoors, king seven, king five, obviously something like that. Just improves both ranges that kills the value of something like A7 while still the board is really, really dynamic. Yeah, so we only have thin value this is just the perfect example of this strategy here we check raise small you put another small bet out there and on pretty much any river card i guess we still put another small block bet in with pocket eights and a7 for example so yeah we need to decrease our sizing because villain is protected now with new two peers with new king x and our main part fuck so many of villains is five is four et cetera i guess with a small sizing absolutely and like villains random eight x as well four x five x i'm very very wrong so far that it felt too small for equity denial it is fine okay two last questions By the way what's the best possible card after check raising seven five four after check raising double it all right the best card which cards are we freaking looking for after check raising what are we hoping for it's a quick one that's a tough one all right it is the nine right we we check raise stuff with backdoor flush draw backdoors backdoor straight draw backdoor flush draw that wants to deny as much equity as possible so obviously it's something like 9 10 that wants to check raise like fold out something like jack 10 so the lower the cart and like the lower the cart the better for us the lower the over card the better for us while actually not having villain catch up to anything good right obviously an eight is is not cool so nine is good here and not putting out any flush draws is good here as well so now i give you another 10 seconds to think already because you can guess the next question. I'm asking you for the worst card here. The worst card. You can think about it already because you again have only 20 seconds I guess but that should be fine. So same board, worst card after check fundraising. No one? Okay. Pairing the seven, pairing the five, making a straight with a six or the six itself that the eight makes a straight. All right, you got this one. So as I said already, no flush draw there is better uh for out of position so obviously we want to have a like we don't want to have a flush draw there but for the answer of the question we want to have a flush draw there because that's really bad obviously two straights getting there at the same time but we have more like a7 type of stuff and some 10-9 and jack-10 bullshit uh this is the worst part the six of diamonds and yeah. And yeah, we'll take another. I will go a little longer to show you the sim there as well. And yeah, let's first have a look. And sorry, Hannes, nothing for you. But Mark, great job there, climbing back up. Tucker, this was your coaching, I hope. And we have Patience, please, on the top. Solid top solid solid solid uh i hope we have nothing so maybe if mark clicked on the 75 in the one question and tucker didn't then actually mark a second right the 25 points would make the difference but i think uh you guys uh yeah it's whatever he wins second here we go we're not done yet philip feel free. Thanks for the warm words. See you next time for sure. But now I want to give, don't show the last three. Is it possible to show? I don't think so. Is it? Does anyone know? I would like to know. I put it off screen, guys. I put it off screen. But let's have a quick look here. Just that, right? So obviously this is a it so first of all the checking entry is very very important because we get into that just all the time and here i offer two sizings where we see the smaller one is the offered one just attacking jack 10 attacking queen 10 jack 9 all that and this makes it so important if villain villain is allowed to stab jack- queen 10 king 10 king that all high frequency if we tucker only check hall against that strategy he will realize a shitload of equity so if you step small here we can check raise either pot or small so the small one is our choice here and let's have a look at the 100% frequencies first. Pocket eights is the one. Ace seven is the one. King seven, slightly less. Nines, tens, jacks. Queens are still fine. We're like, right, the higher, the less important because it is just all about equity denial. I don't really understand the king, queen suited though. That's a little weird, but then it's built around like a little, okay, we can have the nuts, obviously. Some of that six X, we have that seven X. Some of that pocket fours, pocket fives, pocket sevens. We need them. On some runouts, they are the nuts. On some runouts, they are not, right? We can fast play them. We can slow play them, but far away from being a hundred percent. And this is just, well, actually just very strong hands. And yeah, this is how we play that because we've checked our full range. Thank you. far away from being 100 and this is just well actually just very strong hands and yeah this is how we play that because we've checked our full range jack nine all right our bluffs here this is why the nine of hearts is such a good card right this year we have a 10 nine a little we have the eight nine a little 10 eight connects to that jack eight connects to that so this is our main part that attacks this part always think about offsuit combos want to fold this shit out here to not be dominated yeah and then maybe this year you can have a look here the king of diamonds there we see all the block betting happening i had pocket eights here pocket nine still going for value a7 still going for value and now maybe looking at something like a queen of hearts river or something like pocket eights are still a block bet a7 still a block bet right we are still playing against seven eight six seven five six and so on so we have that thin value okay maybe here something to look at as well just having a look at out of position eb right this is what was my question for best card nine of hearts highest ev for out of position and six of diamonds was the lowest for out of position obviously high card nine ten like every higher card getting slightly worse nine ten jack all pretty cool hearts better to not have flush draws for input and flush draws for no one but flush draws put out positional advantage so um something like that where yeah maybe to show that as the last thing here range explorer where is our advantage and there is none there there is none right we don't advantage here, but yeah, we still want to make like, just like the attitudes of our hands. They want to make something happen and denying equity is just very, very important here. So maybe it doesn't change here slightly. Right. So this is against the villain's stabbing range. Right. And there we see, okay, actually we don't see much. Yeah. No no clue you want to make villains life hard absolutely let's have a look at this one here the 962s as the other example where we see here out of this and we have clear advantages not in the super nut area but this year this is the nuts right now but not later area this is the gaps we're attacking I make that a little more clear by checking in villain steps. And I mean, we could check raise. We check raise huge now. Let's have a look how ranges look like here. We have the huge advantage out of position here. Just not the super nuts advantage, but that is enough. All right. So cool. Maybe because I have it here to show again how important it is. This is something now that you could add on as like a little work. Like how does it work on like a paired board? How does it work on like a typical trade-off board like this one? It usually combines two strategies a little. It's not a clear one thing like 9-6-2s or 7-5-4, where it's a trade-off board. We check a lot. I only allowed half pot, which, I mean, any sizing is fine. But to find out the structure, this is good. But we see, OK, some small makes sense. Some big makes sense. Right here, pocket queens want to go big. We can play multiple check-raise sizings. Or we just say this is like no offsuit two pairs. We go for the big one and go from there to have an idea right to have an idea how things look like and yeah to have some patterns which hands right to find the king queen offsuit with clubs for example that is something i would be going for stuff like that maybe a last board the jack seven four mono where again it's a trade off board if we check will will only should step small we're not check raising often on flush boards but how does it look like which flushes do we check a check raise okay not the clearest pattern we take the high card flushes and we take like random ace x ace of hearts x we're like yeah okay right the lower the better maybe to have another thing going for us but um but that would be like step by step so i tried to give you the ideas today with like having two different strategies we want to use and then um we we can uh we can look a little deeper at that and i'll come to the last slide summary key takeaways is for you be aware of the ranges first of all we are not playing big versus race first in. We are the ones having the over pairs. We want to make use of those. Then we need to next evaluate the board and figure out our strategy. I showed you two strategies. There will be a mix existing sometimes, whatever, I don't know, maybe I missed something, but understanding that this strategy number two exists and is absolutely crucial for our strategy to improve our red line in this blind versus blind game is very, very important. And then next, often the board feels ugly for us, but trust me, it's as ugly for villain. So don't be scared of continuing thinly. I've shown you the pocket eights that keeps going on two over cards, just making use of sizings as well really kill villains range there making him suffer and understand most important last point there's more than going directional in check raising doesn't mean that we are in the plan of like overbet overbet directional and there's more to that we were just check calling while having fold equity. All right. So definitely it's what I can improve a lot on in and everyone here. The quiz has shown that. Have fun doing so. And yeah, I hope you enjoyed it. And yeah, as always, leave me feedback in the feedback thread anywhere. Keep discussing. We have good action going in the cash discord right now. Post the hands i'm sure tucker will post some more on blind versus blind um and we can discuss that try out what what works what doesn't and let's see you the next time
