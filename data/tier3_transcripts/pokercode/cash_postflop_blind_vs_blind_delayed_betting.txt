### TOPIC: cash postflop blind vs blind delayed betting
 Hello everyone and sorry for the delay. I just got pretty much fucked up when sitting down at the computer here. So yeah, everything was prepared and I just figured out that the Kahoot disappeared in a way. So yeah, I tried to rebuild it without mistakes. I can't guarantee for anything, but now finally ready to start. so I'll give it some more time for you because I think I didn't post the pin I just see it for the first time to make sure that all of you want to participate, and I highly recommend everyone to do so. Actually, while preparing that session, I figured out myself that it's very, very, very, very close to the last or one of the last sessions we had a big blind after big blind versus race first in when we are out of position and the flop went check, check. It's a little different scenario as not being the open raiser, but the theory works the same. and i think that session went quite well so i decided to keep the same structure and once we really get started i'll show that again but we'll have two quiz parts not too big this time but still you can test yourself your thought process not the thought process but like your first instincts you can test them first then we talk about how I see the spot a little more, have some... process but like your first instincts you can test them first then we talk about about how i see the spot a little more uh have some examples for sure and then um have another part of the quiz to maybe uh see that you well maybe progressed a little already and uh and yeah have it that way so um yeah just just waiting uh i see 27 people in here, only 18 in the Kahoot. So again, I highly recommend everyone to participate here. Just put out kahoot.it and put in the game pin you see here. Yeah, if there are any questions, feel free to ask them in the chat. And then we are probably ready to go in two minutes. So yeah, sorry for all the back and forth pretty much between Slack and Discord. I'm getting used to it myself and just figured out that I didn't have the rights to post in the coaching announcement thread and Discord so far. So I just asked Hannes for help. So this is a little little back and forth there that will be way smoother in January when we are limited to to one thing and everyone is on there. That will make things way easier. So yeah for now I think I'll just give it the extra minute to wait a little that everyone can participate. What is Kahoot? This is just a tool to ask fast quizzes. So just type in this year. Unfortunately, this is German. So this just means participate through www.kahoot.it. Just put that in your browser or your phone or anything, and you will be asked for a game pin. You put in the game pin, and then we will have some quizzes, and you can test yourself and give me input. And this is just the way we use it in most of the sessions. So yeah, I'll start with the session. You have the game pin in the chat now, I hope. Megan, you have another two to three minutes to make it happen before we actually keep going. But now, finally, time to start and to talk about our topic today, which I expect, like every single time I put out the three options, I'm very, very certain to know which one will be the chosen one. This time, I was so sure we talk about raising blind versus blind because it's my favorite topic and I love it and I can't understand how we cannot love it so you guys surprised me but still a super great topic I had a deeper look into it the last two days to get some guidelines going to to understand stuff maybe a little better myself not just it's always a different thing between just like executing something and feeling that you know it well enough to really teach it to others. So it's really like, helped me like to make one step forward there myself. And I think we'll find lots, lots of cool things, maybe little helping guidelines. So this is our topic and yeah, let's get started. As always, we start with the spot itself to just make sure everyone knows what we are talking about here all right very easy we open race from the small blind and we get called we do not face a three bad we were first in everything very very easy then we decide to check the flop and villain decides to do so as well. We check the flop, villain checks back and now we are in that turn position. It's our turn to come up with a delayed strategy and this is what we are talking about today, right? We need to discuss every turn card that might get out there. So as a little advice I gave you beforehand was already double check on the community coaching or it was a poker code academy coaching last year in summer that I started doing about blind versus blind in general. So I started there, I'll summarize that very quickly, talking about mainly three different types of boards. I love simplifications, especially in a topic that is so huge like blind versus blind. We can split it up in ace high boards, king high boards, queen high boards, etc. But that won't help us too much. So I want to cluster them together. Like whatever fits or is played in the same way, I want to save in my brain as like kind of the same thing. And I did that by just the simple strategy we are playing. So first thing, the easiest one, we never have to think about the flop. And we will not talk about those today is the so-called range bet boards, right? Not necessarily 100%, but if that is like 90% range bet, that's totally fine, right? We can see solves, whatever. We can find reasons to even bet full range or 85% frequency, all cool. Thank you. range bet, that's totally fine, right? We can see solves, whatever. We can find reasons to even bet full range or 85% frequency, all cool. Obviously, why is that not the topic today? Because we have no chance to get in the delayed spot. When we see bet ourselves, well, we won't get in the delayed spot. That's it. So forget those ports for now. The second type of port, the other one that is very, very easy because we have a clear flop strategy already is the so-called range check ports. Villain has a huge advantage right now. He will keep it over time or even increase it over time. That can be a monotone board where positions just matters a lot and positional advantage is huge. Something like ace, king, queen, all spades, great range check board, or a board where villain has all the straight advantage. Seven, six, five, rainbow will be one of our example boards today. So those are especially interesting for us today because while obvious, we check 100%. Now it depends on villain, how often he checks. And well, once he does so, we are in our delayed spot, exactly what we are talking about today. And then everything in the middle, I call the trade-off boards, right? It's like we build a betting range, we build a checking range, mainly trying to use just one sizing to keep things simple. And yeah, the so-called trade-off boards where maybe one thing is good for us, another thing good for villain. So it's like, this is where real poker starts. My example today for this type of board will be queen, six, five, rainbow. It's like the five, six connectivity is great for villain, just like having more of that stuff in the big blind. But the queen gives out of position a great advantage. Like kings, aces are still strong. We have the back backdoor broadways it will depend a lot on the turn card if the turn is a four or a seven that's big blinds area if the turn is a king or a jack we are freaking crushing it from the small blind having all our broadway cards so this is something to keep in mind maybe already for the delayed spot there so yeah i, I hope everyone made it to Kahoot now. Last chance to write stop in the chat because I will start it in like 10 seconds or 20 seconds. And yes, maybe this is the last slide before going to the Kahoot. This is how we approach. Stop Severino. Let's go jump in there. So can you show the number again, please? It's in the chat. You chat you can read in the chat but I can show it on the side here so plan for today we will start with the quiz just throw you in the cold water test things out then we'll talk about well the core things of today's coaching bat sizings and the reasons for that. Then we'll try the same thing again, just a short quiz, right? Four boards, four questions, that's it. And then we'll have a look at typical mistakes, potential exploits. I will get input from you and you will get input from me what I think the main mistakes are. We wrap things up, have our key takeaways. And for me, the goal really today is that you leave that session and have a plan like, okay, this is happening. This is the type of board. This is why I'm using sizing X or Y. And I have, like, this is the first thing. And second thing, I have exploits ready. I have an idea what people are naturally doing wrong. What is the reason for them doing that wrong? Well, maybe some lines are easier than others to play. So then we have like prepared exploits. That is what I love, right? Going into a spot and I know, hey, if this type of villain, I go with ABC, let's freaking go. Okay, let's fucking go. I guess that's it, David. Let's start the crew, 28 people in there. I'm happy with that. And um yeah first before really testing you uh as i always start in the sessions a little brainstorming just give me your input did you prepare for this session what did you think about how do you see that spot whatever tell me anything you thought about that spot before entering the coaching so sorry for making in german again the last one i tried to prepare today uh that somehow got canceled wasn't english actually i'll promise i'll do it in the january coaching so the nice snowman is telling you please players put in your ideas and it's just give me input but everything that is written down now i hope i can answer during the. So if you have like one certain question and you put it out there, I might remember it. If you say like, ah, the spot is perfect. I know everything. I'll probably just let you do the coaching would be great as well. And yeah, my back is by the way, still fucked up. So I will do lots of stretching throughout the session and like have weird positions. I might, I might even change between standing desk and sitting right now, I was standing the whole day so I feel like sitting, but I think you can put in multiple answers actually. If it's a, I never participated in the brainstorm myself so I have no clue. I'm pretty sure you can you can cut it down to to like uh fewer words we need we need more twitter generations here or like old people like i am just like using sms where you just had to pay like for every amount of like signs you used. All right. So. Okay. I don't understand that part. Sort things, but okay. Let's have a look. High card's good for a small blind. Low high cards good for a small blind low cards good for a big blind all right in general yes big blind capped right check check means probably last time in the where blind versus blind we talk a lot about out of position and nuts we did that we did that in the in the probing coaching as well where i told you you, hey, to build a pot, which is the only goal of our nutted hands, we have multiple options out of position. But in position, we have only one option, which is betting. So a big blind cap is a great thing, right? So big blind is forced to bet his nuts in a way. Floating equity, okay. Expect population to overpull turns as not checking enough strong hands wow this is like uh i think is that number one of my my mistakes list so yeah lex raises here we got number two of my list uh that looks good range splitting due to wide ranges yes i call that like people playing their hands especially true when we have wide ranges and people are not necessarily sure what they should be doing range wise so they just look at their hand and do whatever they feel like first smaller sizing middling stuff non-violent hands block batting will be a big deal out of position definitely yes think about how many strong hands we checked on the flop sure very low confidence level in this spot as i play mtt as well loving it so maybe you will have more limp pots where ranges are even wider so you're raising and then getting called ranges might even look a little different a little spr as well so try to not take everything I say today like word by word and try to more think about the ideas we are talking about, right? What are we attacking? How does villain's actual range look like, et cetera? People probably weak, right? Because they, let's just say we have a pattern, right? And you are nailing pretty much my observations already. People doesn't balance double checking ranges. Yes, attack. As people attack in position, right? For the other side. Same thing as well. Challenging spot, knowing which boards to continue on. How is our strategy influenced? If it's a range check or trade-off board, it's actually the same thing. Like whether we checked on a trade-off board or we checked on a range check board, the ranges are similarly strong relative to how strong we are on the board so we check everything all our shit but all our not our nuts on a board that is just very bad for us which will end up in like a solid okayish range or we check like the weaker part protected with some nuts on a trade-off board, where overall we connect better to the board, leads to somewhat same ranges. So it just is good to know, okay, what is that? How often do you have which hands? Did you check them all the time on the flop or sometimes bet them as well? So this is something to keep in mind just for your personal navigation. Where are we in the spot? Did I think think okay well it's just thinking about how capped small bets outfit doesn't need lots of fold equity right taking risk reward into account very important here removal after check checking military i'm not sure what that means other position has more sets than in position there will be lots of betting yes not sure whether that is just about the sets and those wide ranges, but actually the statement itself is true. The reasoning, I'm not 100% sure. All right, not perfect. Perfect thing here. I haven't thought much about it, right? Probably just playing your hand most of the time. Happy to learn, protect flop checking range hands that I plan to check raise on the flop, right? We still have them after check check. So usually adding some kind of nut advantage depending on the turn card. And so main things are here really talking about the exploits that we will get to in the end of the session about how nuts, I like that a lot that you talk a lot about nuts, which, well, I do in every coaching pretty and yeah to really see okay who is the boss in that pot and who is responsible for for building the pot and how do we navigate through that okay so yeah let's start with the first quiz part the first one is a puzzle and i'm just asking you how often, just like give it a feel, right? How often should we get in the delayed spot? I have the sim ready. We have three different boards. Pretty much the question is how often does it go check, check? Small blind has to have a check. Big blind has to have a check. Then we are in the delayed spot. Which one are we facing the most often? Put it on the very left or up or whatever the sorting order is. Highest frequency first and then step by step. Just the first feel, right? It's more a question about flop strategy and yeah good luck i think i would fail no pressure okay does that mean everyone everyone is wrong so uh yeah actually the monotone board is the one we should be checking the most, not checking the most, but that is stepped very, very little at as well. It's just the thing that, well, out of position is mainly checking because of the positional advantage of in positional and monotone boards. Is something changing or not? Nuts do not need to get bet here because they will stay nuts over time. It's like even the nut flush gets checked back like 50% of the time. No need to get money in against anything because you can still explode later and rather protect your range. So here, this is a very high frequency check and then actually only like a 15%, 20% step from the big blind. Well, all the other boards like 765 is a clear range check board. Small blind is checking 100% or 98% in my sim. But at the same time, big blind has a huge advantage. So he is forced to bet pretty, pretty often. Same for 554. 554 is here out of position can still bet something. So this is very, very close between the two. If you just mess those up, count it as totally right. And then queen 65, just small blind is a little stronger there. Small blind is like betting 50%. If he's checking big blind is like stabbing 50%. So that's the board where lots of betting is happening. everyone has something. There's reasons to deny equity. So yeah. All right. So we will see those boards over and over again. These are our four example boards. Today, I will work only with examples because it's not as easy. Going to the turn means something happened before that makes, well, guidelines very, very, very tough because there are so many ifs, right? If this is a range check for it, trade-off for it, jack high, queen high, and then we add the turn card and then we have a guideline, doesn't help us that much. So I try to use those examples to have real spots and we have to learn from them and transfer that over to other situations that might be somewhat similar. So this is how this session is structured. And now we got four questions, one question to each one of the boards and they are all the same. I'll give you a turn card and I'm just asking which sizes we are using. So guys, now we have the checked. What is a trade off board? I just explained. I have three board types. When I play small blind versus big blind blind versus big line one is the range bet board i can bet everything as the small blind because i have a huge advantage king queen deuce king king three something like that the second thing is the range check board where big blind has the huge advantage seven six five is one of them right the low stuff. And then everything in between is a trade off board. We're like, I need to really have a checking range, a betting range, et cetera, et cetera. Those names came out of our flop session where I just tried to cluster those boards together to have like certain ideas and not just talk about blind versus blind. So I have three categories to talk about. And the trade off board is just pretty much everything in between. Queen 6-5 is a trade-off board. I hope that answers the question. And now we'll go step-by-step through those four boards. And I give you turn cards. I think the first round is mainly brick turns. Maybe a spade on the monotone board. So be sure to get that one right. And I'm just asking you, which sizings would you take for your delayed bet? Thank you. maybe a spade on the monotone board. So be sure to get that one right. And I'm just asking you, which sizings would you take for your delayed bet? Sorry, guys, no points here. Multiple things can be right. So we have 554 with an offsuit deuce on the turn. Which bet sizes are we using or should we be using on the turn? For using on the turn i said like i looked up the solves and it means like more than 10 frequency then it counts obviously we can take like two percent of anything but yeah this is what counts as right for the question here and for everyone who hasn't been part of like many of the coaching so far the two e sizing means i go all in in a linear way right that just means i bet here it would be like 250 pot on the turn and then another 250 pot on the river so yeah most of you got it right i guess the small sizing is the main the main choice. We are attacking Villain's freaking queen-nine offsuit. Overbet is not a thing here because Villain is protected. Villain has ace-three. He should check back quite some fives. He has not advantage over time with that 3x, 6x, 6-7, 7-8 even. So yeah, pretty clear thing. And looks like you did quite okay. Let's get to the next one. Oh, no. OK, don't worry about that. This is the wrong order. OK. Ace, 9, 8, monotone, we get spade number four out there. Which sizings are we using now? Everyone can have the freaking nut flush. All right. So even 75% is not a thing. Just too easy to react to. Right, 75% means villain is allowed to fold quite a lot. So it's just very, very easy. And this is why positional advantage is so huge on monotone boards. He has spades, he has peers, he has shit. Facing a big bet just makes it very, very easy. 2E, Bela, I just explained it. 2E means linear sizing direction all in. So here in that spot, I think it's like 240% with the sizings I'm using. So, okay. I mean, one person was using 2E on that, like saying villain just doesn't have king of spades. That's okay. But that looks okay here. Custom crushing it. So let's go number three. 765, getting the brick juice on the turn. Again, we are living in the solver world for now, right? We'll talk about exploits later. So it's not about what you think is best to do, but it's like what the solver does against the best player in the world. Okay. 30%, not a thing. Let's go. So yeah, main thing I can give you the small explanation already that here, different to all the others, is villain has position plus what you think you are attacking with a 30% bet is actually forced to always call. because it's just drawing to something that is still a value bet. That's one of the main questions, right? So maybe we do not need the 75. This is just the options I gave in that simulation. Maybe 50% is enough, right? But the problem is like, well, 8x, 9x is definitely not folding on that board. So we are targeting something like 10x as the weakest hand. Maybe queen 10 folds to 30%. But it's already close. King 10, queen jack hitting a river is a hand that can easily value bet. Therefore, it has implied odds. And then a 30% bet, especially in position, is just a very very very cheap price and does not really attack those hands so um yeah we need to size up here 75 is a thing 150 is a thing given that villain has well not disadvantage on that board after checking back we talked about that on the beforehand already in position is forced to bet nutted hands on dynamic boards where nuts change. They need to build a pot now. So if we have such a board and the freaking deuce is coming this time, well, then out of position has the clear nut advantage. It's not like I have 9-8 and want to make use of it just like all the time now. And I go to E direction all in. I'm the only one revering nuts, but it's like i like to size up what is 2e on spr 16 in percent has to be massive like 250 so uh spr 16 means stack to pot ratio uh wait one second so that means we have like i'm so bad with that i'll just do the math for you once right so it's like um actually you can build a nice function of it let's just say okay we have let's take my numbers right then i do not get lost i play zoom 500 so we have we open raise to 3x that's 15 billion, 30 bucks in the middle and 500 stack or 485 stack. That's your 16, I guess. So the math is pretty much, I need to build a pot that will be 1000 in the end. That's my stack in the end. And I'm just like calculating how much the pot needs to get bigger relatively, right? So 1000 right now, 30 right now and 1000 it needs to get. So, this here is the overall pot growth in a way. So, if I take the square root out of that, this is what it needs to grow per street. I can take one away from it because this is what is already in the pot and then divide it through two because each player is putting 50% of the money in the middle if there's a bet and a call. And this here is the bet size, right? So 240% more or less. And you can do that with that function, you can make an Excel sheet out of that and have that automatically. It's kind of a cool thing that you can use in format pods as well if it's just a little too tough to calculate in the brain ahead. So yeah. So maybe for everyone who is just not even understanding the question, it's not that important. We'll see it in the solver. Or if you're interested in that, just scroll back in the video that will be uploaded in two days and just try to follow what I did there in the calculator. Not such a big deal. All right, let's get to the last question for now. Oh, Philip, let's freaking go. Queen 6-5 is the board. We get a brick again. I'm not sure whether it is a brick on that board, but yeah, 3-4 getting there, but that's about it. All right, people love overbetting still. Another thing here. Again, if villain is protected, maybe first and most easy rule uh if villain is protected and that deuce is a good card for villain this counts both in as like turning two pairs this is um turning straights plus the advantage of rivering more straights than villain right the deuce here is a risk because every four and three will make nuts that out of position will not have too much. This is why we are not incentivized to build a pot that often, right? Because then we'll run into trouble later. Then overbet is not a thing, right? Kind of an easy guideline to crush those quizzes. In the second part then, 30% is a big thing here. Targeting now here we can target something like jack nine, jack 10, compared to the six, seven, six, five before. Here, those hands are drawing to something that is not a value bet. They are not drawing to a top pair, they are drawing to a second pair. So, and this is why even a smaller price can kill them, right? If we have something like pocket sevens, we did check on the flop sometimes. Now is the perfect time to bet. Get called by six X, get called by five X, fold out something like king eight. This is pretty golden. Two E is a trap. Maybe, maybe we should keep it in mind for different turn cards. Let's see. It's in my SIM at least. So yeah, let's have a look at the standings. Oh, Kasnei got you. My buddy David in here on top, but this is just the first part. Now, let's dive a little deeper and talk about, right, I gave like some small inputs on those examples, but let's have a look. So now, bet sizings and reasons. This is what I tried to mention, right, Like seconds ago is really with high stack to pot ratio, right? SBR stack to pot ratio, just like lots of stack left. It is not about what we talked about three bet pot last time, where it's like, we can just jam the turn and whatever. No, it's about preparing a river. We are forced to play the river and there are still lots of room for the river right so this is why it's so important to not only think about nuts now but what can happen on the river let's go to that queen five six deuce again river can be a seven can be an eight can be a nine can be a three can be a four a five or a six all those cards for example are shit for out of position. So big, big, big trouble ahead on that river. This is why probably we shouldn't build such a huge pot before and wait for the river card that we know where we are at, right? Not wait, but like not blow the pot up to then have trouble later. So what we want to focus on is those two things. Nuts right now and nuts over time. Like freaking single time it is about the nuts right so the guy who has more of that should be the person well building the pot more or less often they are spots in those wide ranges where we can think about well actually it's like both people have quite something. And then we get to point number three here, thinking about the dice principle. For those who haven't seen that video or aren't unfamiliar with the dice principle, I tried to break it down very, very shortly. It's just, I think, in hand strength, just in a way of the number of the dice, to put it into six categories. Number six is just the total best hand possible nuts. Five, very, very strong. Four, something in between. Three, whatever showdown value. One, nut low. Something like that. And this is just a little helper for me to think about, okay, what do I want to attack? and if i have a six, right, which is I sit there with the best hand possible, my only goal is to think about how to get the maximum from a five. I'm not thinking about villains ones or twos. I don't care. I think about his five. And when villains five is always betting itself, I don't need to start over betting. I try to stack off against the five. This is what I mean with dice principle to navigate. So queen, six, five, deuce. If I have pocket fives, which I sometimes check on the flop, sure, I can overbet, but do I need to do that? I'd have to freaking nuts here. Let's forget about three, four for now. But the villain might have turned a set of deuces. Villain might have checked back a strong queen that he raises now. Villain might have queen deuce suited. Villain might have something else. Villain might river a two pair. He will bet all those hands himself. So there is no need for me to go like 2-E, 2-E, let's go all in. I'm just showing you I have the best hand ever. It's just killing my range in a way. If I bet my nuts big, well, what is happening to the rest of my range? So this is what I mean with navigation. And then we have something like the necessity to deny equity. We talked about it on the 7-6-5. Yes, we need to deny equity. There we had the extra problem that, well, villainous just has nothing to fold, right? Every hand is strong enough to call a 30% bet there. So maybe we need to size up. Maybe on a board like ace-king-queen turns deuce. It's not really necessary for us to deny equity because villain is not drawing to anything. If villain has, like, what would villain fall on the turn seven eight sure yeah but it's fine for me if he sees another card maybe he hits fourth pair doesn't help him at all but he's he's drawing to bluff catcher always thinking about what is villain drawing to with the hands he would be folding to a bet now. And is it worth folding them out for the price I'm getting? We have the queen five, six turn deuce. I talked about pocket sevens, for example. They benefit on the one side from getting value and from weaker peers. And on the other side from folding out something like king eight. Very, very important on that board to deny equity. This is why we will see lots of small betting on that board. We'll see way, way, way more spots, but this is what I want you to think about. Two E as the turn check rate sizing, maybe. Yes, great one. Definitely, if we check again, then this is the perfect spot to say like, hey, let's freaking go directional insert. We are playing for stacks when we have nut advantage, yes. So important things, get that right. How does it look like when we think about nuts? Have that in mind. Dice principle, do I need to go directional and with my nuts or is villain actually helping? Well, then I can, to re-raise i can check to check raise to e i can i can do whatever then thinking about smaller sizes is mainly do i need to deny equity on ace king queen i don't need it right why right fold out seven it doesn't make any sense right yeah, probably not too much of a thing there. But on queen six five twos, huge, huge. And then one more thing, lookalike principle that I mentioned all the time is just for yourself. We will see lots of those mixes out of position. Same thing. Our nuts want to go directional in. I don't care whether they check race or they bet huge or small to then re-raise. Their goal is to go directional in. I don't care whether they check race or they bet huge or small to then re-race. Their goal is to go directional in. And whether I feel comfortable to just go random 50-50, 30-30-30 with all my lines or find the perfect thing, I don't know. I personally like having those things where I know how I play them. I call them the cornerstones of my range. For example, the fives, queen, five, six, deuce. If I check my fives on the flop, I will check them again on the turn because this is what I do with every single five X. Deuces, pretty much same thing, right? Then you have right away your potential bluff candidates to have those lookalikes again. If I'm checking all ace highs in the spot, I'm checking my pocket aces most of the time as well. If I'm betting small with my top pair, I'm betting small with my top set as well. That's just a little helping tool to see like okay, that you know where you are at, that you actually know in game, yes, I am protected in that spot. Yes, I'm having this and that. All right. That's great. I can probably apply this to all. So let me see here. Does this dice principle work in reverse as well? For example, if you have a three, you want a deuce to call, but a four to fold as well. This shouldn't be possible in theory, very, very certain spots, but it's like, when you think about it, you have multiple options. I think it's not possible to find a way that a deuce calls, but a four folds, that would be a fucked up play by Willem, but you should think about either folding out a deuce, making a deuce call, right? Go for a thin block bet for value, or, well, when you have a three and you think it's not strong enough to or you don't want to bring it to showdown somehow you can think about well take a crazy line to fold out the second nuts right try to fold out a five can make sense or to fold out a four right so this could be something in a different situation that you a three can be a block bet on the river with a plan to re-raise as a bluff against a thin value raise from villain something like that right it's it's maybe it's it's really just like a thought pattern that you think about the right stuff i don't want you to end up like betting the nuts in a overbetting way that will only cost the second nuts. That would be very, very, very bad. Okay, so let's get to one of the examples I prepared. So now we wanna just have a look at that, everything I said, just at one specific board. So I'll pull the, where is it? King, six, three. King, six, three with a flush draw. Thank you. board. So I'll pull the, where is it? King six, three. King six, three with a flush draw. I hope this is big enough that we can still read both sides. And this is what I call a typical trade off board. This is the flop play. We check 55%. We bet 42%, only small bet. The big bet does not exist. Again, this is the king is good for out of position the three six connectivity is not good a flush draw out there is always good for in position in a way so yes it's somewhat in between right we see let's have a look at our nuts uh pocket kings we can check we can bet pocket sixes we can check we can bet aces we We can check, we can bet. Pocket sixes we can check, we can bet. Aces we can check, we can bet. Ace king like... This is what I mean with trade off board, right? Like we have no clue. So to get into the spot we are talking about today, we definitely check this time. But we have in mind we have a big mix of things. Villain again has this, has like multiple sizing options here on that board. This time he checks back. And we get, let's say, a four of clubs on the turn. Let's think about that. Actually, before, look, now we have the strategy. Okay, never mind. So what about nuts right now? Nuts over time. The four is definitely a very, very, very bad card for us. The one has three, four, six, four. More five X than we have. More deuce X than we have, more seven X than we have, seven, eight, king four, obviously. So he adds plenty of nuts. Pocket fours. Yes, we have our sixes. We have our threes, but in general, all the, think about offsuit hands, all the offsuit hands we are having, they did not improve. We have queen, jack offsuit. We have queen, ten offsuit, jack, ten offsuit, ace,uit ace jack offsuit ace nine offsuit all that kind of stuff so now we think about nuts right now nuts over time clear advantage for in position therefore over bets are cancelled out of my mind over bets not a freaking thing makes it quite easy so we have pretty much in my sim we have two options left big bet yes but which hands want to bet big it's like yes king queen maybe to get two streets on a somewhat brick river but which river is a brick against weaker kings it's like yes that's pretty much it and we see yeah in a way we can do anything right other hands is more like pocket force we can block bet we can check, wait for a good river to then go crazy, whatever. It's just accepting that villains should play the major role when it comes to betting here. I don't say we are checking. Well, it should be doing like 44% of betting. More than we here even. Even though out of position usually does more betting than in position, right? Doesn't have the option to just check back and take the free card. So this is the first thing here. Necessity to deny equity. Very, very huge. Villain has queen, jack, jack, 10, 10, nine, ace, nine as well. So it makes a lot of sense to deny equity. And we can get that equity denied for a very, very small price. So when I look at those sims, I always try to look at those hands that do something 100%. I don't care about King, Queen, right? There's so many runouts. We have some value, sometimes two streets, sometimes one street, sometimes one overbet, sometimes one normal bet and one block bet. Anything can happen. But one thing that is clear, pocket sevens, they want to get called by 6x, 4x, 3x, and they want to fold out queen jack. If we bet small or queen jack, jack 10 is the perfect example. Jack 10 is folding 100%. 6x is calling 100%. This is what we want to achieve. And this is why pocket sevens need to bet 100%. Everything that is way stronger or something like pocket queens that doesn't need to deny the equity that much can still do whatever, right? This is the beautiful thing of out of position. We have all kinds of options. We can build a pot by check calling, check raising, check, check, and then delayed betting or betting ourselves. So this is something to think about. For each hand you're having, ace six, yes, freaking let's go. Ace nine, ace eight, ace seven are just clear checks. So maybe balance that out with pocket aces. Do we want to bet small? No, because then villain folds jack 10. We don't want that. We want him to, oh, he has 0% equity. Let him freaking hit his jack and get a big street in there. So something like that. So here with dice principle, thinking about the nuts, and now maybe something about the lookalike principle. What are we doing are we doing with our 4x well sometimes we are betting sometimes we are checking what are we doing with pocket force sometimes we are betting sometimes we're checking what are we doing with uh where is it our freaking trap pocket kings sometimes betting small sometimes betting big sometimes checking. So those things here as well. Right. So you see, that's kind of a, kind of a pattern where you just should know and do not think about like, like absolute hand strength too much there. Right. It's more like which hands fit together, understanding that any line makes sense in a way once you choose the right sizings to I see so many people discussing what the perfect play with king queen is here. I would love to stop that discussion in the first second because it just doesn't matter. Important is to check ace nine and to bet pocket sevens. That's the important thing here on the chart. Okay, let's have a look at another turn card. Or maybe what did I write down here, actually? Actually, I talked about a certain hands here. Let's talk about those goals of certain hands. I did that without showing that slide already, pretty much pocket threes and sixes. They have the goal of getting maximum money in against the king-axe or two-pair. right it like they can bet. If they bet big, well, king-axe calls. That's fine. Two-pair raises or calls. That's fine. If they check, well, most king-axes are betting, so they can check-raise. Let's have the bet out there. Threes and sixes are check-raising. Everything makes sense. Pocket sevens, I talked about them a lot. They clearly wanted an equity from those hands and get value from lower pairs. Clear goal. Ace nine, get to showdown, win versus weaker ace X and queen X. Another 100% hand, queen jack. The goal of queen jack is really to river one of the six outs and then have the cooler on our side. With a small cooler, I mean check, check, river, jack of hearts. We put a big bet out there and villain just rivered jack-10 or jack-9. If we bet before, we fold out exactly those hands. So this is not what we try. We try to do the opposite actually. What are our bluffs on the turn? Well, 10-9 comes to mind. That is benefiting of like folding out the potential small coolers. So just that always having clear goals. What is the goal of your hand? If you find something that makes a lot of sense, I bluff 9-10 here because villain folds, jack 99, Queen-9, Jack-10. That's a perfect goal because then if you bet here small, you river your hand, one of your six outs, that's 12%. Awesome, you have a value bet now. Just a block bet, but perfect. Makes a lot of sense. So yeah, let's have a look at another turn card. Let's have a look at the six of clubs, not six of clubs, the queen of clubs. Very, very great card. So first of all, we finally see some 2e here. So hopefully it makes Severino a little happy. We have nut advantage. We are the only ones really having king-queen for frequency we are having pocket queens we are still having sixes and threes villain is not adding new nuts too much plus nuts over time ace on the river is great for us jack on the river is great for us 10 on the river is great for us nine on the rivers or somewhat great for us so we prepare we are prepared are prepared. And everything else is kind of a brick. But now after betting big, do I care about a five on the river? No, not at all. Do I care about a deuce because villain has like some four or five? Not really. So that changes everything. And just because it's not just about the nuts now, but what will happen over time. So here again, we clearly see now we have freaking nut advantage. Villain is not incentivized to help us too much, right? So if we check here, villain will have lower batting frequency. So we want to take over control with our nuts. Pocket aces, ace king, king queen, close to 100% frequency. If they are not betting, aces and king queen, they will check raise for sure. It's like the goal of getting the money in, but here they lean clearly towards overbetting. And this counts for those hands that are vulnerable. King queen is not nuts anymore on an ace river or a jack or a 10 so it wants to get the money in now because it can still navigate through on the river even on those cards that are bad for the hand because they are not bad for our range so villain cannot go crazy on them that's a big big big difference and here how we still protect things, lookalike principle, pocket sixes. What are we doing with our sixes? Well, we overbet our two pairs. We check or bet small with our sixes, whatever. So we overbet some sixes, well, the two pairs, or we check them. So let's do the same with pocket sixes. What do we do with pocket kings? We bet normal, we bet small, or we do whatever. Let's do exactly the same with our pocket kings. What do we do with queens? Well, we overbet, we bet small, or we check. Let's do that with the pocket queens as well. So I have those cornerstones of my range here. Aces, king, queen, and some draws are 100% overbets in my personal range range kings are a normal bet in my personal range queens are actually 100 check for me here right because i'm not implementing that small betting range with that medium queens here i prefer to simplify and just just check them all the time so yeah we never see it in game that's it right we see here, but no one is really ready to go for it because it feels bad to have missteps there. People are scared. Probably over-banning here is printing money for you, but everyone is scared to make something wrong. It feels like the potential mistake is like X amount bigger. Where in reality reality this is just the correct play when we understand it so goal for everyone now next session find the spot to take the 2e over bat sizing the problem is just it's not making infinite more money than like a 150 percent bet but it's maybe a little tougher to play on the river say a hearts. I could ask you now, how do you play your ace king now on a nine of hearts? How do you play your king queen? Most of the people will be lost, right? That like ace king is just a block bet anymore, right? King queen, check call or normal bet. We don't have the overbet anymore, really, right just jack 10 or bluffs but not necessarily the only thing because villain now has nuts himself with the added uh jack 10 right it's like some offsuit combos change we start playing very tight ranges even though it's optimal for us right if we do the same thing and the river is a 10 will be a different thing right villain has less ace jack and jack nine than he has jack 10 right you see like oh well actually he should he should call quite a lot of ace jacks so maybe uh there's this in the resolver i would say in reality people definitely fold ace jack here on that turn against 2e but uh so maybe that is is off what i tried to say here right the 2e i expected yeah that ace king is still a normal value bet compared to the night so it's just the potential mistake that people are doing is is bigger it's fine right to accept that and just say i understand overbetting is the thing i don't feel 100 confident with it so i only go with 150 leaves me more room for the river. Totally fine. cut the 2e off, but use 150 instead of the classic 75. You're not making use of your advantage having aces, for example. All right, so yeah, let's have a look there again. Sevens now have less value, right? So villain added queen x plus he doesn't have that four x that he turned in the example before so yes there's still something about denying equity from 10-8 but it's not necessary like we have less value and run into better hands more often so we probably check down and try to get a block bet out of on some rivers ace nine has the exact same goal aces ace king charge villain for the maximum now before there are more cards that hurt your exact hand strength. That's something like 10-9, cleaning outs, making use of nut advantage, one of the perfect bluffs out there. Makes a lot of sense, right? The Spade just to have some navigation on Spade-Rivers again, blocking calling range as well. So, right, we see just two examples here for very, very, very different turn cards and on one of the trade off boards. Let's see what the next slice, okay, right. Let's just summarize that very, very quickly. I think mainly about two things, about strong hands and about denying equity. This is my guideline here. I see the turn card and I think about the nuts. Is it my job to get the money in the middle or is villain helping? And I'll show that example again. King 6, 3, 4, villain is definitely helping. Definitely. He should, right? I have problems on the river. He should start blasting blasting a little now so i don't need to do all the job queen on the turn oh villain checks back all the queen acts he has no reason to blow up a pot not having really nuts or anything so it's definitely my job so my nuts want to go direction all in now or being some of the super traps right that blocking calling range, that are fitting in the lookalike, perfect, right? And then deny equity. On the four, deny equity was massive. Here, I don't see it as important, right? We see the small betting here, but we see that it's mainly queen X. It's more like pushing our advantage a little. It's like not denying, like it's denying ace-axe. Villain has lots of offsuit aces. I always see this here, folding range. My queen-10 benefits from folding out that, from getting called by worse, obviously, as well. But the worse hands, whether I check-check and take one big bet or I block bet twice, it's the same in the end. My queen-10 does not benefit from folding out 9-5. This is why I think denying equity is not as important here. And we see way, way, way less of 100% hands. Your queen 10 is telling me I can do whatever. So I simplify it away and play without the small bet there mainly. But on the four, it was, we we need to freaking bet small now this clearly always shows you this is clear eb we are making that if one hand decides to do one thing 100 we need this line and um yeah so here we have it right first thing thinking about nuts how to get the money in the middle second thing about the like weaker hand smaller thing obviously we need to we need to balance that out with nuts lookalike principle deny equity how important do i want to have that small bet or not necessarily when you say helping do you mean the turn is favorable for villains range yes or it's like even that just like it's not just i see really as like two people working together to go directional in obviously everyone tries to fuck up the other one but it's like sometimes it's just you need to do the job because villain would love to get to showdown cheaply in general and the other time it's like you wanting to go to showdown cheaply in general then you want to check your nuts just like all the time and it's like really who is how incentivized about like Thank you. like you wanting to go to showdown cheaply in general then you want to check your nuts just like all the time and it's like really who is how incentivized about like by by how much nuts we're having so we can usually see that here when you look at the top percentages range explorer in position out in position out of position we clearly see like okay this is kind of even out here is not taking into account the overtime. We don't see like a 5x as nice nut outs here. So we need to not only look at that but really have that in mind as well. And then maybe have a look at the other turn, queen of clubs, then that will look very different right here we see out of position as the clear clear advantage even on the top plus again taking over time into account what happens on a river 10 river jet right we can now with huge bets we can make villain fold those gut shots mainly so it's like nuts that only we will have all right or same thing villain won't have like five seven on the river if we overbet now so the river four is actually a brick right we can we can design the situation in a different way for us this is what i mean there okay Okay, this is the first little guideline. I guess we get to the... Yes, we get to the second part of the quiz. So now really try to really think it through as good as possible. When villain is protected, there won't be overpats. When villain is protected, our big size will be mainly the 75% size. And then think about necessity of denying equity. Sometimes small bets make sense, sometimes not. What if villain does not help building the pot either by not value betting thinly and or under bluffing and or using too small of a size we'll get to that in the exploitative part now let's stick to payo right now for payo let's try to to get the kahoot as right as possible and then we talk about exactly that so david good luck let's get him we'll take the same four boards again but now with favorable cards for us five five four again we know that board king of hearts on the turn which bet sizes are we using on the turn more than 10 have the dice principle in mind maybe what would you do with your nuts here for example Thank you. maybe. What would you do with your nuts here, for example? All right, so we see some 75% betting but less than 10%. So first of all, overbet could make sense in an exploitative world here. But what are we targeting? That's why I mentioned the dice principle. If we have a five and we check most of our fives on the flop, we want to get the maximum money out of a king. To get that done, we do not necessarily need to overbet. A king will bet itself at some point. So we can check raise huge. Or we can block bet to then re-raise. So actually this year is a thing where we really just take the 30%. It's all about denying equity. Villain has so many hands now. Jack-10, queen-9, jack-9, all that offsuit shit that is drawing to nothing, right? It might be drawing that to a king already. So we really want to target that huge heart, the small bet it is. Okay, see, it's not that easy. It's not that easy. Ace, nine, eight, all spades. Now we get a king. We add a king on the turn. We are playing pile, not in the real world right so i'll give you a hint uh people are checking back enough not people but pio is checking back enough flushes as the big blind all right here we go so to answer the question but doesn't that contradict building the pot where villain might not build the pot we'll get to that exploitative part yes but here we are incentivized like so heavily to put lots of small bets out there on that talking about the 554 king philip that we are betting such a wide range that villain is incentivized to raise his king like this is the perfect thought already if people are not doing that we need to take control of the pot size more and maybe start over betting or check raising or just like betting normal and then over betting to get the maximum right but really that understanding here we should bet we are betting something like ace queen and ace jack for value on that five five four king so villain is really like him having a king is just as having the second nuts that he should be raising and this is why then we take our five look alike not look alike like dice principle wise and just like go small have a protected range and then re-raise again okay i understand ranges differ depending on position but can you deploy the same blind versus blind delayed bet spread in other positions yes absolutely but there it's tougher to evaluate the cards because ranges are very very like narrow right here let's say a five on the turn and knowing okay villain will have a set of fives is a different thing than like cutoff versus button where probably those three set of fives now are i don't know five to ten percent of villains range so this is very very important to really evaluate cards correctly when i play for example in a cash game versus people who flat the cutoff or MP, which people are doing really, really, really face up with like sevens through to nines, right? Or I'm playing three bet only for that reason, to not be face up. Against some people, I can take my freaking aces and check fold on 987. or i check a weak ace on ace nine deuce the turn is an eight and villain starts betting large after it went check check well i know he just has sevens eights and nines so he won't bet sevens big so he does it with eights and then it's like really what i want to say there is we want we need to uh react way more extreme to certain turn cards whether they range or not, right? Then we can go super, super crazy as well. And this year is pretty much the master spot where we learn about all the incentives to have everything because we play very wide ranges. Everything else itself is way easier and you can obviously transfer a lot, like pretty much every thought process. You just need to apply it accordingly. Would you say there's a significant EV difference whether we choose the bet 30 turn into bet 150 river compared to bet 75 turn into bet 75 150 river? Just asking myself that on 554k, doubt we get raised a lot there once we block that is an exploitative thought and then i don't like the 30 150 line at all and whatever you want to bet 150 on the river you shouldn't bet 30 on the turn then so yeah it's just like the small into overbet just doesn't exist when you want to use that line your small that is wrong in the first place. Yeah, that's just like the small into overbet just doesn't exist. When you want to use that line, your small bet is wrong in the first place. Yeah, that's it pretty much. Big into big, small into small. If you like small into small can contain nuts that Billon re-raises. But if that is not the case, you just go like big, big. We'll get to that. So now question number three out of four, I guess, of that part. David fighting back, loving it. Okay, 765. Now we get the king again. We love the king of hearts for that round. What are we doing here? Actually, I'm not sure whether I misclicked that i think 75 might be a thing as well so uh that was let me just look it up uh because i'm really unsure uh that might be a fuck up because of the the kahoot rebuild i had to do quickly 765 check check king of hearts yeah yeah that's that's that one is on me so all of you are pretty perfect with the um with yellow or green right it's we had the seven six five deuce before where it didn't make sense to bet small because i explained it that every hand even as small has like two over cards drawing to a hand that can still value bet. And therefore it's reasonable for them to pay that price. So 30% is not an effective bet size. That changes on the king. I just think about villains, queen 10, jack-axe, ace-deuce type of fence. A villain has like only three outs now or is drawing to a second best hand. So it's like way tough for facing those 30 if the king brought a flush draw does our bet change not much not really it's a little more small because like flush draw always helps the navigation of the in position player so we keep it a little smaller on average and then make up try try to make up for that on brick rivers, but doesn't change too much. So, yeah, sorry for that mistake. 30, 75, both fine. Messes up the, like, yeah, but this is now kind of variance. So might have went either way. David, clicking on the upside of it. All right. So let's get to the last one, the queen six five. I'll give you a little hint. Sibarino will love that board now. We get the freaking jack of clubs on the turn. All right, here we go. So yes, and this is why 2E is such a great sizing for all the MPT players out there. I didn't put out the stack size there. Like here I'm talking about it's 400 picks. It's about 240%. We did the math before. But if you play 40 big blinds, it works the same way. If you play 60 big blinds, it works the same way. It's just like 2e then is not 240%, but it's like maybe 180. Right? So this is what you can work with. And what we see here is that, yeah, the big sizes just do not make sense. We either go direction nuts or we make use of like, we deny some equity, right? The queen jack high here is a little different to our example of like the king six three queen uh because here we can deny equity from queen from king highs and ace highs so even more incentivized to use that small sizing so uh whenever there's i don't know which hand you have that wants to choose like 75 percent just doesn't exist right i'm happy to show you actually. Let's have that queen six, five, and then a jack of clubs on the turn. Okay, I'm loving it. Okay, let's have a look. So first of all, let's double check the whole thing. This is perfect trade-off board. Go check, check this time. Jack of clubs. See the 20%? Let's go. And like the 150, right? If you say like you are not using that and use this one instead, that's fine. But if you have the choice between the two of those, the bigger one, if done perfectly, is slightly better. If if not done perfectly maybe this year is a little more yeah but this year just doesn't make any sense tell me your hand you want to use that here king queen good enough for for two big bets queen 10 in between right it's like maybe queen 10 wants to go like big big to get maximum out of queen 8 i don't know maybe the one hand and then like queen 7 is not good enough anymore it's like really we have the nut advantage or we see here pocket sevens they love betting small even here jack x loves betting small uh just because of what is folding right we get ace x to fold that's three outs and we get something like king-eight king-seven whereas it should be suited as well out there which is big upside for that for that bet size for those type of fans all right so um yeah now that it was like i think that was the last question oh so so congrats to everyone here but we'll keep going so you have seen the one question before that i want to ask here and that someone got in between and that was just write it to me in the chat right we discussed that already and i mentioned a couple of those what are your your, like, what are the main mistakes? Let's try to really break it down. What is the main mistake that people are doing in the big light? So we think about what can we do exploitatively in the spot we are talking about and therefore we need to know what villains are making wrong in their spot. Just put it in the chat here. Folding too much. Okay. So think about why. There are different types of folding in a way, right? Are they just, are they folding hands? They should be be calling or are there other reasons for them over folding not protecting check back range playing two face up and straight forward yes checking back capped not defending capped range on the turn versus bets not enough protection raising all right right. Cap check range. They don't raise enough. So we really have two main things. People bet when they have it, which means when they do not bet, they don't have it. And they are not raising enough. Protection raising for me mainly faces like the small bet. We are betting small because we're either full of shit or we just have like very thin value and against that people should raise thin for value and for protection maybe we talked about that five five four let's have a look at that board as well about the turn play here five five four goes check check and the turn was king of hearts right here we've seen yes the, the big bet is maybe king-queen only. That's it. Everything else is small, and we see how much we should be betting here. Every king. I talked about the ace-queen, ace-jack for value, right? Because villain is forced to call all those weaker ace-acts to not over-fold. We're taking, again, our queen-jack, queen-10 in the checking range to have the potential cooler on our side. But the ones that have the cooler against them, they try to bet now and fold out dominating hands. So we bet small. And here, that's not a protection raise. That will come on the river. But there is some raising already. There's just like some bullshit raising. But that's actually not the good example that I want to look for. Let's take another one. Sorry, guys. let's go to the 765 check check and let's take something cool like the three even right so again small betting big betting and here we see like plenty of raising this is what are talking about here. When was the last time you faced a small bet on that turn? And then you decided to raise your ace 10 off. When was the last time you decided to raise your jack nine off here? When was the last time you decided to raise your king 10 off here? So think about that. We are a group of about 30 people here. We are talking about villains, but actually we can do the same thing and just think about ourselves, right? We are our villains in a way. If we all think alike, then this is what everyone else out there is thinking. It's not like we are the genius group and we crush everyone else. This is what we are trying to achieve. We try to do things better. But if we know we have never done it, we at the same time, no one does it. So yes, this is definitely one of the things. Plus, I ask you again, have you ever done that? I checked to you on a range check board here, my full freaking range. And you decide to, well, at least 15% check back your mid-set. When was the last time you have checked back your mid-set here? I just take the last life of Severino for that. So never, never, never, right? It's just like 10, 15%, but it's missing, right? I mean, I can talk about the 5% of 9, 8 here. In real life, this is a never, right? Obviously fives and sevens, we have a never. Probably we have it even stronger that those always bet big and the shit always bet small, right? So could be even more reads into that. What about, I mean, are there any two pairs? I don't know. Seven, six, checking back. 25%. Right? Like, never, never, never. So let's get just to, I collected a list of three things which fits perfectly to what you wrote. And it's quite face up, right? Because we know exactly what we are not doing. This is what no one does. But we want to adjust perfectly. So the typical mistakes and potential exploits at the same time. Because we know exactly what we are not doing. This is what no one does. But we want to adjust perfectly. So the typical mistakes and potential exploits, at the same time, they always belong together. Number one, people in the big blind playing their hand on the flop. The problem is they are not not protected on the turn when the turn doesn't give them new nuts. So this is why it is so important. For on that check check deuce. This is why an overbet exists here and we know right away what is the exploit now. Invest more money in the delayed game tree than you should. We can do that with two things. We can increase the frequencies and or we can increase the sizings. The only reason to not overbet is, well, villain will bet the hands we are trying to charge himself and then we can check rates or he is freaking protected and we make it easy for him. But what the fuck does villain have? Like why? Against weak players. I can see myself taking pocket nines and bet 2e here i always have the best time just always can do the same obviously with fives and sixes right they don't need much protection so actually i prefer more to check race and then i go direction d2e right if i check here uh villain bats i like we see a mix here but then that depends on like some re-raising but here villain no like i'm going freaking to e river is whatever a king and then the money goes in the middle all right so this this is my plan here at least right as again exploit we invest more money in the delayed game tree than we should in theory okay uh when i timed out brazilians think another way when was the last time you called would be the right question okay uh would have to search i never do it as uh not many people attack that enough later right it perfectly right it is right for us to never protect because people are not going over aggressive but But exactly now in our spot that we discussed today, we want to be that person. I'm not even talking about being bluff or value heavy. I don't know, right? Whether freaking Vamo player from Brazil is calling them with his 6-8 or not that he checked back, like probably calling. But yeah, it's just saying I'm using bigger sizes in general. I'm going for value and i take with my clear value ends i take biggest size as possible so really that example pocket nines against that type of player why not going freaking to e i have the best hand 72 right and then villain sits there with his 8-6, obviously calling, maximizing my value. Okay, adding bluffs, obviously, right? So this is my number one and the biggest ones, right? We can go crazy here. Number two, people are not raising enough versus small delayed bets. That leads to two problems and to two exploits. First, we as the small bind over-realize equity on drawing hands. So usually villain should raise like 15%. Those 15% that he's maybe not taking or 10% he's not taking, we see a river card. And if we played correctly, well, we have something that now rivers a value bet. For example, we see that card, we have our value bet. This is over-realizing equity or just even a bluff getting into another plus EV river bluff situation on certain cards. Again, over-realizing equity. Plus, big blind loses potential value. There are lots of things versus small bets. Those, yeah, Billa called it the protection raises, right? They raise for protection and then have to check back on lots of river cards. It's not a polarized raising. I try to get directional in. Let me try to get an example. Maybe we have one here. one here check check let's get that king of hearts out there we have the small bet i mean not here it's king high sucks let's take it jack and a 765 just sucks right so here 76565, jack-9 is a fine race here. King-jack is a fine race. Then we race. Out of position, have to call my pocket 8s and my pocket 9s. And the river is a freaking king. Then jack-9 obviously goes for the check-check. If he doesn't do that, I sit there with my pocket 8s, pull up. I save that turn call. So this is what I mean with big blind loses potential value. This obviously has to do with the fact which we'll see in the exploit part, right? So first I want to increase that frequency of small delayed bets with hands that are indifferent. Whenever I see in that game tree indifferent, it makes sense, first of all, to deny equity. And if I see like betting checking in the solver, it's like same thing. I just go all the time. I over-realize equity. Well, it's probably if he's not raising enough, he's missing bluffs. And bluffs are usually hands that he's folding. So this is one part where he's over-folding. This is where, Sjövn, I asked you where you said people are people are over folding. We now find multiple reasons why they are over folding already. They don't have their nuts in their check back range ever. That weakens their range and just because of that, they are folding too often on the turn. Not the wrong hands, not anything, but their frequency is off. Then, second thing, they are folding hands that they should raise on the turn. So they are not like making wrong falls, but they are missing the raises. And therefore, this is like they are over folding again. Plus then they are calling hands that they should be raising sometimes. And that allows us to see one more card and potentially catch up. So, yes. And here, the other important exploit is that every single hand, nutted hand, think about the dice principle, that is relying on villain raising. Doesn't make sense to bet small anymore. If they are not raising, right? Remember, our goal is not to play fancy payo, to bet small to re-raise. Our goal is to get the freaking maximum money in the middle. And if we can't rely on villain raising, well, we just over-tag the job, right? Let's freaking go, right? Let's just then check raise instead when we are sure they are betting their top pair instead, but never raising. Or we just over-bet. I don't mind't mind right just like jack of hearts on the turn put them on a freaking jack if he hasn't jack he calls anyways but he's not raising yeah then take my queens and overbet all day long i mean here it's a pioplay anyways but in general we have that on the let's say the five five four right so uh let's let's let's have Let's have have a look at the 554 what the plan for our nuts is so first of all we check the board high frequency villain let's have a look at his fives he should check back with some of his weaker fives five six like half half of the time ace five half of the time probably not happening that's the first reason to go crazier. Exploit, invest more money by increasing frequency and increasing sizing on the turn. Check check, turn we have a king, both players have it. We should only use the small bet. So the question is now, hmm, villain is not protected and villain is probably not raising. Overbets are not a thing here in the simulation because well villain should be raising and he's very well protected with ace five anyways so let's have a look what is the plan of a hand like let's take our eight five what's our plan here we bet small okay villain calls river is a brick nine what is our plan with uh eight five right you see right away uh sebarino here small into overbet pretty much never exists right here it's like small into small would be my main thing small into small and then villain is forced to raise king jack king 10 king queen villain raises small and we have another re-raise with ace to eight five so this is where we clearly see hey this is dice principle at its at its best where when we know villain is not raising his king jack that just doesn't make any sense right then i'm the first one who just says like fuck it if he has a king he has a king let's go 150 here he definitely calls river is a king. Let's go 150 here. He definitely calls. River is a freaking brick. Let's go 150 or 200%, whatever I prefer with my five. And he probably calls his king off all the time. If this is what I think against a specific player, I get the maximum value. Let's go. Why not? So yeah, very, very important. This is number two, people not raising small delayed bets. Now number three, and I have no clue what's that. I totally forgot. Okay, people don't bluff enough delayed as the big blind. So not even delayed, just on the flop as well, right? Every street, their checking range gets weaker. Same thing for not raising. Let's have a five five four we check to him villain should realize how good that board is villain should bet every single time pretty much with jack ten having a spade ten nine having a spade ten eight having a spade if and lots of people in lower stakes are not doing that they nothing, they check. And this is another way how they overfold the turn, right? It goes check, check, turn is a king. We bet small. They look it up, maybe even, and then they see 10-8 is a perfect fold. They play perfectly, but do not even realize that this hand is never in their range because they are just missing the flop bet. And this is we can transfer that over to the turn again if we check the turn to them which we sometimes do with our ace eight then they should start betting again right they have kings they should yeah they can add bluffs jack eight of hearts are people betting jack eight of hearts here in that frequency let's talk about lower more passive players. There are lots of people who are not doing that. What does that lead to? Well, their checking range gets weaker, and the exploit is the later the street, the more you should overbluff to win air versus air. So pretty much if you play high stakes, you don't find many people with airir still on the river. Let's put a brick out there. Again, I mean, nothing is a brick on that board. But let's put another five out there. Five sucks. Let's take the deuce, even though ace-three plays a role. And here, ace-nine would be a block bet for value. So, yeah. So, villains are just like sitting on ace-six, ace-seven, ace-eight, queen-8 queen jack queen 10 all the time on that board we're on lower stakes against weaker players they might even check down their 7 8 so again when we bet small here and thinking about bluffing you see like that jack 9 is not a bluff here i'm bluffing that up but all day long because here is what is happening. And people have those hands way more often than they should. And again, probably not raising enough. That 7-3 being 100% bluffier as a raise instead of being a fold. Stuff like that. So really one thing, and this counts for everything. The later the street, the more you should over bluff. Small sizing, just the air versus air part. And this is more true the wider the ranges are. Okay, I think this was it. So great stuff. What about the flop when villain is not finding the correct stabbing frequencies? How much is that changing our strategy there? I always feel like missing value when I'm c-betting so many cases. that is was big part of the flop session pretty much we are happy to repeat that on all the let's get a trade-off board or even that counts for the range check boards as well we can always exploit but like smaller exploits are definitely possible on those uh we we need less of a reach to do it on a trade report right that i always want to see that as options it's not this does not mean to me king queen should be bad 50 of the time and be checked 50 of the time this me, I don't care what you are doing, both is fine, which makes my life way easier. And then it's up to me, right? If villain is investing more money on average by betting, I prefer checking, right? I want to get money in the middle with that hand. If villain is investing more money by calling than by betting, then I prefer to bet myself, right? I think I get more money in that anyways, right? If you say, Sibarino know that lots of your your villains are just like yeah hmm they are not stabbing right then it's like okay you check your king queen and they are not starting to bluff their 10-9 ever well you're losing a lot of value obviously right so um yeah that. That's it pretty much. See it as choices and then choose the perfect one for each opponent. That's it. And that counts for every street there. Okay. Let's get to the key takeaways. What is important for me? I worked with examples and I explained it in the beginning because we have the problem the later the game tree the more it is it is tough to break it down into certain scenarios right you see i came up with certain turn cards only on four boards i could have chosen different boards right i tried to have very different types that you see like okay this works here this works there but it's the thought process i want you to have your your guidelines ready right dice principle does overbet make sense or is villain betting himself anyways necessity to deny equity who has the nut advantage who should do the job of building the pot thus betting small like do i achieve something really talk to Really talk to yourself. I have 8-9, 8-9 high, but I get 9-10 and jack-9 to fold. How bad can a bet be? It will always be good. Plus then, think ahead. I only mentioned three exploits, potential exploits, they are probably more, right? And they can get more and more specific, more sizing reads, more of villains write down as much as possible discuss it and i want to say slack let's go to discord so have that right see that always as a starting point right to have like something you can do next session right away put out a small delayed bet go for a random river bluff delayed. Go for a 2E sizing when it makes sense, just because you feel like it. All that stuff, test yourself on that and improve. And have your exploits prepared. As I said, I delivered three already. Go a little crazy in those delayed spots. It's a very, very nice spot to have a clear advantage people are not used to to fancy sizings so there's more room for for um just like edges and yeah that's it that is uh what i hope to see uh from you in the in the in the channels uh discussions going on nice nice hand histories going on and uh then i i'm happy to comment on that as always let's see what is uh there in the chat would you say you defend your checking range correctly then versus bets if you check capped Thank you. comment on that as always. Let's see what is there in the chat. Would you say you defend your checking range correctly then versus bets if you check capped as the exploit? I hope no, right? If we are saying as an exploit people are not betting enough, we don't need to protect our range. That's part of the exploit. All right guys, that's it. Have a great afternoon, morning, night, whatever where you're at and um see you in discord and for the next videos and sessions soon
