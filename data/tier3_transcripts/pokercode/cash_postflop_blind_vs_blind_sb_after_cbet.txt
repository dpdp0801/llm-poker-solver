### TOPIC: cash postflop blind vs blind sb after cbet
 There we go. I want to get started right away. I already prepared. So there's add-ons coming for you. There are already some videos for today's topic in post-production. So they will be maybe already uploaded when this year is uploaded. So this will be for everyone. And I think they will be actually great. Let's get started right away. Today, blind versus blind, small blind after seabed. You made the choice. I tried to influence you to get you to my favorite topic, raising seabeds in position there, blind versus blind. You said no, unfortunately. So we go obviously for the turn after CBETing the flop. Quick update there for everyone who is not too familiar with the sessions I gave before on blind versus blind. There's plenty of stuff on the platform, especially one blind versus blind session where Fedor joined me. This is my personal favorite session we had all time because I think it was just very, very good. And there it's about blind versus blind, how to structure things. So the quick thing is that I split up boards here and we talk about like range bed boards, trade-off boards on the flop. And so this part we leave behind us today and actually tackle those boards where we went for a seabed and then see what's happening on the turn this is what i have planned we'll talk a little about where does the ev come from what you focus on we'll talk a little about cornerstones of our range but i think it's always important to have when we have wide ranges that you have something where you know the way for different lines right your triple barrel standard your trap standard your something in between standard to know these are my cornerstones these are my high eb hands i mean with that strong hands that protect that range or that go all the way for certain reasons we want to figure them out to know them in the future in pretty much any spot and then we always know okay we are protected here with this we do that this is why we can bluff and so on then obviously the biggest part today will just be examples i didn't prepare a quiz because turn in that wide range of spots is really tough i could ask you for some frequencies and so on it's tough to get a lot out of it so it's more me talking and getting two examples then running that down we will talk more theory, and we all know that theory and actually playing is very, very different, especially when we are not playing super high stakes against absolute geniuses. I will give you some exploitative thoughts, very easy level, such a complicated spot where we could go into detail, but just already something can help a lot to give you an idea. Then we summarize stuff with the key takeaways, always. And now let's get started. I would say the spot as always, I think I explained it already, but can never hurt. This is what happened in case someone just jumped in. We did open raise the small blind first in villain calls the big blind. We see that villain calls again. We see a turn card and come up with a strategy. This is what we are talking about today. We see the turn card, we have to come up with a strategy. The flop is in the past, that happened already, so we can't jump back and then check instead when we dislike the turn card. We are in that spot, we need to find something. And now let's start thinking about our range. Where does the EV come from? So first of all, I want to explain to you how I see the EV, how I have it in my head in a way. We started with a seabed range, like a variety of hands, just a typical range, right? And now we want to maximize that range EV, which we usually do by just maximizing the EV of every individual hand, right? Because the range EV is just the sum of all of that. But now there are some important hands and some less important hands. And this is something that people get mistaken a lot because this is something in the solver, what is important or not important. Our range EV is mainly from the very, very strong hands. They make the money. While people discuss, should we bluff this year or do this or that? While they talk about decisions that are often indifferent or just very, very low EV, which means, well, the potential mistake you can be doing is just very, very small. So very, very important here is to start with a strong hand. I want you to know all the time how you play the nuts, the second nuts, the third nuts. This is where the money is made. These are the hands that you need. Everything else, well, we have thin value bets as well. They're obviously important as well. Value bets are the most important stuff. And all the bluffs are just additions. Additions to force villain to call down your value bets in the end, right? Or overfold and then the bluffs start making money, but they start from zero, right? They start from zero in the perfect world. And then if villain overfolds, we get to something, but then we talk about very small EVs. All right. So now how we think about that, we think about the full range. We have the idea that we specifically think, want to think about our strongest hands, right? That leads us to something, all the word I use a lot, not equity or just not advantage. And this is what we need to do in our spot here. We need to evaluate the interaction between the turn card and the given ranges that gets there. This is tough already because we don't know perfectly what our range is after c-betting. Like, let's be honest, do we know exactly what we did c-bet and what we didn't? No, we are kind of making something up. We have no clue which hand's villain called on the flop. We have a good idea, but again, it seems so easy, but that villain villain called we need to know what he did not fold and what he did not raise to tell you right away okay what is the interesting things it's like which hands can he not have which hands does he have so here we need to see okay two parts and we have a turn card flying in how does that interact with our range how does that interact with villains range so now on highest EV hands. If Villain has way more nuts than you now, it's an idea to shut down, right? Probably we don't have lots of EV. And now again, I said it already, don't waste any time or not too much time on indifferent hands. Whether you take your medium top here and bet again or bet a little smaller or you check it to take one more street on the river. If you look it up in the solver, it does not matter. This is only exploitative level. If you want to discuss exploitative level with friends, with someone who plays those games, perfect, right? This is maximizing your EV as well. But if we're looking at GTO wizard, at a solver, and what is theory, all those things do not matter too much. All right. So in different tense, in the solver, actually, I need to show the solver. I wanted to keep that for later, but I can't help myself. So let's open up GTO wizard for a second. We study a spot, small blind, 100 big blinds deep, open raises, big blind calls, something random happens. Let's go into our spot and we get a random turn card. And now this is what is the problem for lots of people out of position that we see infinite mixes, right? I'm not interested in that spot. Now we see, okay, big betting, some small betting, lots of checking, but what to do with certain hands. Let's have a look at the top set. We should sometimes bet small. We should sometimes bet medium. We should sometimes bet big. We should sometimes check. Thank you for that, right? It does not really help. Here's obviously, I want to know what I'm doing. And the answer can be, I'm mixing it to protect all ranges because here's nothing the clearer thing. It's something I want you to understand. To be good at poker, it doesn't mean that you need to learn that stuff. Not at all. This just means it does not matter. It's always important when one hand clearly wants to do something. It is important to check your ace king here. This is important. Everything else would be a mistake. It is important to check your pocket force. It is important to whatever. Take the over cards, bet them sometimes. Don't bet them sometimes. Bet them more when they have a diamond. Cool, right? This is what we can understand. And whether that is the perfect mix or a little different doesn't matter too much. So really understanding where EV is made, what is important. Pocket tents, we need to understand that this is a freaking mandatory bet. So this is what it's about. This is just what I wanted to show. And in the end, I love seeing sims where things are mixed. It means I can choose. I can choose. And I love choosing because this is where I can start getting really exploitative without really messing up my game. This just means all the time, okay, I can be choosing what I want or what I think is best. And all the sizes make sense in a way, even in a theoretical world. So it's like exploiting while not really being exploitable at the same time. I mean, that's not true, but it's a different way. All right. So now, oh, there's something like paint games. Okay, let's have that. If I write it down, I think we have to pull up paint. This is now what we need to do. So here, this is mainly meant for evaluate interaction between turn card and ranges. So I said it already. Maybe someone in the chat, Severino, maybe you do it for us. What does it mean if villain calls? We want to break how villain's range looks like. This here is villain's range. We'll get a perfect answer from Sivarino in a second. Villain's range, a four turn card, and we will have our range. Here we go. He didn't raise and didn't fold. So Jerome, this is kind of perfect. If you can translate that into my graph, it will look like that. He doesn't have the shit part anymore because he is folding his shit and he doesn't have his top part anymore maybe a little for protection but especially on dynamic boards you're forced to raise your strong hands before nuts change to get money in the middle right so the top part is off all right so this is now the range we are facing and again the beautiful thing as most of the time as the aggressor is that we still play a linear range we did bet some of our strongest hands here this stuff we have this stuff we obviously bet like some middleish hands as well right everything that is ready to build a pot maybe we checked our weakest and we don't have the very very weakest but we definitely have bluffs if we did range bet we even have the weakest hand so this is our range against villain's range and And now we need to evaluate how that changed having a turn card flying in. All right. So actually I copy paste that and we have a good starting point. This is the range and we need to move things a little. And this is what we need to do in our head here. Villains range after turn card. It's just the turn card appearing. There was no poker action now. This is important. And heroes range after turn card. Let's say we get an absolute brick. What does that mean? Anyone in the chat, what does it mean if we get an absolute brick regarding those ranges here? No nut changes. 2E. That's the strategy thing. I just want to change my picture in the correct way. How do I need to change my picture now? Do I need to kill some lines? Do I need to switch some lines? Do I need to move something? Oh, equity usually shifts. Okay. Same line, Mitranos. Here's the answer I was looking for. Okay. So we have the same lines. It's exactly the same things. Obviously it changed because some draws had good equity on the flop, counting on hitting the turn. Sometimes now they didn't hit. But regarding nuts, think about the high EV hands. I want to think about those. The equity shifts into in positions direction usually because he only continued when he had something. So when nothing changes, he always has something and out of position only sometimes has something. But if he has something, he can have the better stuff. So when we think about the nuts, nothing changed. And this is why on bricks, we see heavy overbetting, right? This year, the middle part goes into a checking plan and maybe going for one more street later. And this year is maybe even two E-sizing. Like actually, there are some spots where we see higher than two E-sizing, which is super fancy. You will love it. And we'll add equity bluffs. So this is how it looks like. Actually, when there's a brick, nothing changed. Okay. Let's say there is a card, a very not changing card. What do I need to do? I don't want to give an example for now because I think we learn it better thinking in general terms. The nuts are changing a lot. A card that favors in position now. Yes, we're Chevy. We're absolutely evaluating who has more nuts. I already said it's shifting into villain's favor. So villain has more now. Right, villain adds a lot of nuts, which we don't. So this is perfect. So let's say draws get there, which means we'll take them actually out of his weaker part. It was maybe nothing. And it's nuts now. At the same time, everything like, let's say this is top pairs, mid pairs, shifts a little down value. Something like that. Right. There is something like an added flush draw to the top pair now. It's a little like that. Incredibly protected. While depending on the turn card, yes, we can have still nuts, but what happened in reality, let's go step by step. The nuts on the flop got weaker this year. Let's say we had the top set, Willem didn't. It's not the nuts anymore. But maybe it's a flush draw getting there. Willem has all of them. I checked some, I bet some, so I only have some in the betting range. Okay, I have those nuts as well. They come from that area, actually. Some of my straight draws, whatever, they got even worse now, right? And the mid pairs, same like that there. So in a way, we end up with a somewhat linear range maybe, maybe having that disadvantage playing against an uncapped range. Very, very different, right? It's like just I'm playing here with some lines, that's it, okay? So this would be for something where a villain is in favor already and you see like okay oh damn it his range looks actually stronger more hands on the right side hmm damn it probably not invest a lot of money and finding a way to get to the showdown cheaply we want to still make use of this advantage here maybe with small bat sizes or so want to be protected if he goes crazy with that tough okay and i'll go back to this one and then let's say we had a brick and we had a not changing card so now obviously there's one thing missing that's the one in between where villain is maybe improving a little let's say he gets some nuts and for us it doesn't change much the time tells play a major factor after checking this is on the very very very incredibly exploitative incredibly exploitative level. For some players, yes. For some players, no. Like the weaker the player, the more it means. That thinking is actually honest thinking and means he probably doesn't have a flush drop. Snap calling means he didn't have an actual decision. It's probably never really strong because he would at least think about raising. This is really an exploitative level in the end. In any spot. Not necessarily in this one. So now I said just the in-between card, villain improves a little, and for me, not much changes. Maybe some new nuts get over here, they get a little worse, and so on, that it's still like villain caught up a little, but we still keep the advantage. These are actually the most common cases. All of the cases, either got it very good for villain, it's very good for us, which means nothing happened usually, or it's something in between, right? Again, those three steps, we will take a deeper look at that, but this is how I see that for now. Okay. So now let's get to the cornerstones of our range. On the turn now, we have the problem that we build different ranges. We split our range again. There's almost no spot where we can bet our full range. That means we need checking range first of all and we need at least one betting range right so sometimes two sometimes just one depending on how much simplifying we want to be doing and this now both those ranges need strong hands again i said that a lot when we were talking about the flop it is not when we have something strong, it is not about betting. It is about getting the biggest pot size possible. This can mean that it could be better to check, right? If we block everything that calls, but unblock everything that could bet, well, maybe that is the case. Maybe we have someone who actually makes good folds, but is hyper-aggressive against checks, exploitative level now, right? Then maybe we are better off checking our very strong hands, right? So sometimes there are things that just work a little into our favor or in the favor of checking to build a pot and sometimes in the favor of betting. It does not mean, and this is a beginner's mistake, that strong hand means betting. So now we want to have those cornerstones to know exactly or a little to have an idea which hands go into which part. And here again, very important that we think about our strongest hands. This is where the EV comes from. We want to have a clear plan with those. If we mess up every now and then hands that have like zero point something in EV, who freaking cares, right So we should be aware of what is not and how do we maximize value with those. There, I give you the little hint with the lookalike principle. For those that don't know the term yet, this is one of my favorite principles that actually is one of the first videos in the general concepts part on the platform. Make sure to check that out because I use that every day pretty much. And this is the first thing that I want to play top pair and top set the same way. I want to play mid pair and mid set the same way. And pocket aces in a way are the same like ace high, right? So having two cards of the same thing wants you to just do the same thing as if you only have one card of those. Because not only because it looks nice and I can call it lookalike principle but because those cards influence the hands that villain has so if we have a mid pair we don't want villain to be betting right so it would be great to find a way that he is not incentivized to bet that often right so maybe put mid set in there because then villain has the same cards if we have top set probably we block a lot of villains calling range so maybe this is something that we want to check a lot as well in certain situations and maybe if we bet every top pair we want to bet this as well so this is something we will be seeing when something like straights and something like flushes are the nuts we can still think about right which two cards exactly are we having how do cards look like like how do we want to playalikes? Like if we have ace king of spades and it's a flush, how do we actually play ace of spades king without the flush? Ace king of spades without the flush. So just to generate some ideas that you have those things going hand in hand. And therefore you need those cornerstones of your range to not be perfectly balanced like an NL 10K player online, but like they are not balanced at all. It's like bullshitting around there. Just people make that up. But you have an idea. You have an idea what belongs in which range. Do you believe good examples would come from playing PLO to better understand the equity distribution ranges for practice? I think that would complicate things. I think we have enough examples in the no limit world and don't need another game to explain anything. Like we can stick in our world and this is complicated enough. This is the last thing that is very important. I just figured that out in a little coaching I gave yesterday that people tend to somehow try to make people fold. Even when they have full shit, they put them on a hand and they try to barrel. We're like this year, I already said, there's almost no spot where we can bet our entire range on the turn. So just think about that way. You cannot invest money with all your hands. So if there is a line that doesn't invest any money, you definitely want to have the weakest hands in there, right? You want to take your weakest hands and put them in the check folding range. So be always aware what is your weakest hand, because this is not that it's a high EV hand, but it's high potential EV mistake if you do something with it. Very rarely we can bet our full range on the turn. Our weakest hands need to freaking go into the check hole. So now I talked a little about how I see the ranges, how I try to evaluate the turn card, given those paint games here. And I talked a little about the cornerstones of our range. And now we'll get to three examples. First example I came up with is jack, seven, five with a flush draw. If you attended the coaching talking about flop, this is what I call the typical trade off board, right? We cannot range bet. We don't need to range check. Everyone has a little something. We have the nut advantage still right now, I would say. Queens, Kings, Aces are still very good on the flop. But the villain has the nut advantage over time. It means, okay, any 6, 4, 8, 9, 7, 5 is killing stuff of us. Do we speak of seeing turns after small c-bet? Yes. It can be like a half pot or a small bet in general. If you want to play those 100 bigs correctly, on this example, you won't have big c-bets. So that makes it easy. So let's say you bet third pot or you bet half pot. Something like that, not bigger, to keep your range wide and have that standard problem. A big bet, well, only exists not in the examples I came up with, actually. That means we want to get more money in now and big bet some hands. Not really. Out of position here, that would be true if that board was played in position. But out of position, if we have something like pocket Queens now, then we want to actually not bet it big because we would only build a pot that we have a big problem in later, right? A big pot to then lose. So we better bet small. Any sizing is fine, but not a big one, right? 30%, 40%, 50%, all good. And wait for the turn. And then we know if the turn is the six of diamonds, like the last option here, then we probably don't want to invest too much money with our queens. And we are happy that we didn't bet big on the flop. If the turn is a deuce of hearts, though, you can ask Severino what he wants to do, right? So now take a second or 30 seconds to think about those different turns and your strategies that you come up with. If you really are with me and you in case have a pen and a paper, that would be great. I have that always here. We can write down for each turn, which sizings we're using. I do that right now. What I'm playing in game. This will not be what GTO Wizard tell you because GTO Wizard is mixing more. I'm simplifying. We can compare that. Right? So I write down two of hearts. I'm playing this one with a check. And I play this one with a depends on villain. Against some people, I only use a 150% bet. Against some people, I use the 2E bet. Let's say check plus 2E. Okay. So this is what I'm using and nothing else. All right. Let's say the king of hearts. King of hearts on the turn. Great card for us. New overcard in the game for us. Straight connectivities for all my broadways, even better. Villain probably didn't improve too much. And yeah, so what am I using here? I'm using a check. I'm using a block bet and I'm using a large bet. Not 2E or something, but can actually be 150. So here I use three things that I do. On the six of diamonds, I again use a check and I only use a small bet. I'm not even betting something like 75%. And now if you were honest to yourself, I'm pretty sure that most of you had in all of those lines, something like the 75% bet or two thirds pot bet, which is considered the standard. And if I just double check on what I wrote down, this doesn't exist at all. Check or 2E, check or 75 on the king for Severino, six of diamonds, check, 33, 55. I think this is too close to each other, the 33 and 55 not making a difference where you can obviously use it, but I would simplify that away just all day long. So now let's have a look. And this is a way we can study stuff, right? Two of hearts, 60, 70, king of hearts, 50, king of hearts 56 of diamonds check check full range it seems like okay so everyone who was with me now or you only thought about it now we can double check right and the board was jack of diamonds seven of did i say spades i don't remember let's say spades and the five of diamonds. And we need the deuce of hearts on the turn, I guess. Okay. So what do we see? We see 60% checking because it's like nothing happened. This is what, what told us in the beginning, actually, when nothing happens, the equity is shifting into imposition because, well, he only continued when he had something. So he always has a little something and out of position still has all that whatever bullshit right so this is why we need to check something we cannot just keep betting everything small bet no half pot i mean maybe some we see the 75 percent maybe a little right something like you see like a 10 9 like weaker like something like jack 10 goes in there. Oh, we can use the 75 here as well. And then what a surprise. It's actually 275% pot. This is cool, right? So this leaves us a pot of 65 when we then have pot size bet left. We just had 275% pot. We have a pot size bet left. And this is exactly taking this out what Danit was writing. We want to get more money in now and bet big with some hands. Now on this turn, this is what you can be doing. But you need to go so crazy big that you really don't create that problem of building a huge pot to be in trouble later. Because if you give Willem that price with a random flush draw and he pays, that's fine, right? If he doesn't't pay well then the flush cards are actually not a big problem or a straight card is not a problem at all like should villain call 9 8 offsuit against the 275 percent bet probably not right so here's a spot that we can see where really we go even crazier than 2e and the first chance doing that is queen of kings how much fun is it to call jack tenders that size even what do you think how often do you call it is it actually indifferent or is it pio always calls down give it a guess a whole chat against our 275 percent bet how is jack 10 reacting because top pairs are never folding fold fold indifferent fold luke i'm not asking for you i know you fold you should you should probably but solver world i fall to again everyone falls in game i hope i hope if we see that fold fold fold okay solver is boom indifferent right so the ones with the blocker to queen's king's aces, they call actually, and the ones without and blocking only draws, uh, they, they are just indifferent. So that's kind of, you see like not a single, it's obviously Isaiah. I call let's freaking go. Okay. So this is the fun one. And we see, this is our major, major line, but now coming back to cornerstones, right? So now we realized, Hey, this is the line we want to take now. What are the cornerstones of that? It's a good question. major major line but now coming back to cornerstones right so now we realized hey this is the line we want to take now what are the cornerstones of that it's freaking queens kings aces right especially queens and kings they need the maximum protection possible and it's not the 150 it's like everyone if you could like it's bad there's no 150 there's like 12.5 you do it with Queens because you've learned that overbetting is cool. River is the six of diamonds and you freaking hate your life. And it's like, yeah, you see like a 10% block bet would be correct. No, it just sucks. Right? So if we do this year of 27.5, we give you enough trouble to see like, okay, we're a random flush draws, all easy folds. So we clean our outs or we get paid the right price. And yeah, so this is something cornerstone of our range. So here for me, important is other cornerstones of my range. Let's have a look at the lookalike principle. Let's have a look how the jack-ex are playing. The jack-ex are this in-between value. You see like ace-jack can go into that overbet. King-jack, queen-jack are already indifferent. They have like one big street of value, pretty much, right? Depending on the river card. And they don't need much protection those year because they cover the overcard as well. So actually they could check and we play with more checks. That would be fine. Or we open up that other sizing, like that normal standard half pot, three quarters quarters sizing and use that bet some weaker jacks get like clear checks and now let's have a look what pocket jacks are doing you see the color just fits very well it's kind of doing the same thing all right let's have a look at the other cornerstone that we talked about already pocket queens clearly want to want to go for that overbet. Let's turn that around. What are actually our hands we want to overbet as a bluff? Well, kings and queens. So what about king, queen? You see that color? That's exactly the main bluff we're taking, especially having diamonds. Queen, X, king, X flush draws, not the ace high ones necessarily. Queen, X, ace high flush draws. Queen, X, king, X flush draws. That fits very, very well to our plan. So now getting to the next sets because they are kind of special deals here who is betting pocket sevens here all day long and be honest with me all right i am i am everyone is everyone is guilty always always always how do you play your seven x you check it always right i don't need to wait for the answers you check your 9-7 you check your 10-7 you check your queen 7 i know it because everyone is right so now here we see actually a7 king 7 are solid bets when we have diamonds and pocket 7s well what a surprise are checking quite often now i could ask you for the 5x i'm not doing that because i know the, but you see that all the 5X are checking and what a surprise, this is what pocket fives are doing. Because what is happening? What? Not for protection. We check it because this is the way for pocket sevens to get the maximum money in the GTO world. When we have a seven, we want to get money from a jack. What is a jack doing? Betting, right? And when we bet, what do we get value from in general from a seven but we block all seven so actually here we have massive blocking effects that if we bet big now yes we get the money against the jack but that's not extra money that's that's the money we get anyways whatever we do but we miss the money that we get from 7x calling and we lose the money that villain is bluffing right what? What would be the thing? We check our sevens now. Villain bets his jack x. We get the same value. Villain bets whatever something and let him bet small and then we go crazy. Boom. Here comes the check raise. Hello. Boom. How many of you are check raising 10.3% on this turn? Are we mixing some the draws into check raise yes absolutely we have other fancy check raises like this year turn nuts blocker is pretty cool this is one of my favorite check raises here having diamonds even better right but just an ace twos of spades or an ace five that's like pretty pretty sexy ones and yeah we've seen in the've seen in the check, the jacks can check sometimes some aces can check sometimes. It's not only making you more money, but it's making you a way, way, way tougher player. Right. If this can come up, like if someone steps smaller, when was the last time he actually had something? Not at all. Right. If someone uses this size, well, a bigger size, let's see. 7.5 or 5. Well, they have their good jack. And actually, this is the way we maximize money, to have their bluffs and value. So pretty, pretty cool. And you start building that. It's tough to know those ranges, right? So you can test that. Run the GTO Wizard for yourself and go with your personal cornerstones. My personal cornerstone is checking 7 and fives you're always on the turn check raising the blocker to the turn nuts and some of the random draws right sometimes i'm just checking nine eight six four on the turn even though you could always bet it but just i randomize a little left and right and then i can just check raise those as well if not it's cool i have a miracle hand on the river that no one is expecting. All right, so this year as far as it goes as an explanation, I see already there's no way we get to three examples, but this is actually the most important one. So, Deuce of Hearts. Let's get to the next card now. Six of Diamonds. I think probably the worst card in the deck for out of position now. What did we write down? I wrote down check and block bet. Let that let's have a look okay we see villain is incredibly strong that rules out any overbet any overbet any overbet any big bet we can start exactly what sebarino was saying like 33 and 55 that's the mix i simplify that to small only and now check our 150 oh isaiah here we go running into the nuts well like a boss the king of hearts okay getting there next i said i wanted to start with that first to have best and worst and then the king is kind of a special card okay so we have some hands let's have a look at hands that clearly want to do something here it's actually pocket queens pocket kings again they want to get some value not let a jack check back or some random stuff or an ace hide just check back realize equity it's not what we want and hands that have like good equity but cannot really check call like a king eight with diamond definitely wants to stay in the pot and now maybe something where you could try and argue for my lookalike principle is not really working and i have to convince you again that it's pretty cool though, is that the whole cornerstone thing with the sets and pairs only makes sense as long as the pair has value. So this was in the example before, actually the pocket deuces, we were betting all the time. We do not want to protect our deuce with a set. Like our deuce is so low EV, we use that as check raises, as overbets ourselves. So the pocket deuces is a wild joker to go overbet. And here we see something like the pocket fives. It's too strong to be a bluff catcher in a way, right? But yeah, we check five X, but it's actually no value. It's like one big blind out of 10 big blinds is ours. That's not something we want to protect, right? We can talk about the sevens. The sevens are still somewhat interesting, but this allows you to still bet that pocket five. Right here, we see what is happening to all our jack-ex. We're checking most of them. So pocket jacks are doing the same. Sevens, kind of the same, right? So it's again, that pattern. We could have a look at diamonds. Let's have a look at diamonds, whether have a look at diamonds whether we find something clear here yep diamond diamond what about the flushes flushes is tough to have something like set and top pair they are not really lookalikes there's a big big big mix we see that the ones with a seven prefer to check a little more often which makes sense right we're checking most of our seven again, the flush is doing that as well. We are betting a lot of our king X and queen X offsuit. So we are betting those containing a king or a queen more often, right? Or both especially, right? And the others are just a wild, wild, wild mix. Flushes and straights are just the wild west. We can mix them with everything, right? We can play queen three as we play queen of diamonds 10. But we can play it like queen jack as well. One of that wants to bet. One of that wants to check. And this is where this mix is coming from. Our hand just wants to get a big pot, in which way it doesn't care about it. All right. Let's have a look at the king. Or let's first check and face a bet. All right. Let's see. Let's see what's happening. We check. We'll understand small. And again, we check a reasonably strong range and again, build a 10% check raise range. Right now our seven say hello. Hello, flushes and straights. I don't care. Let's go. Right. The flushes here. Hello, sir. Let's go. right instead of just that at yourself and leave your checking range super weak as most of the players are doing okay now let's get to the king of hearts and here is what we should be doing i wrote down check plus block bet plus 150 and And here is what we are seeing. We see a mix of 175 and 125 this is what i combine to 150 not advantage not advantage right now ace king aces something like that and not advantage over time if the river is a 10 i'm the only one having ace queen if the river is an ace i have all the queen tens and villain fall it's the ones without diamond on the flop if the river is a queen i have ace 10 so very very very very good turn thinking ahead already future what can be nuts on the river and then obviously the nuts right now ace is ace king and so on and now again we can see the lookalike principle right what are What are all the king eggs doing? They are betting different sizings, block betting, normal betting, whatsoever. Kings are always betting. So it would be wrong to think about, okay, we always check top set. Maybe that's correct in three bet pots sometimes, but not here, right? What are the jacks doing? Well, they are either betting small or checking when they are weaker. Oh, what is pocket doing it's never over betting and again i could ask into the chat now how often are you freaking blasting it with pocket jacks here and i would get lots of yeses i would say and now there's the point again where pocket sevens mix but it's not a clear thing and this is again the case because a seven you see it's already getting turned into a bluff here when it has diamonds it's not high ev anymore i still want to protect it a little i think i would actually check it quite often and it is a thing but it's a high frequency bet and then the five actually does not have much value we use it as like queen five is just randomly going for a bluff blocking two pairs and so on right so the pocket fives are just going for it and again we have our cornerstones in a way right the block bets right thinner value pairing up with the lookalike pocket jacks for example right if we bet small and it's again it's not about being balanced forget this word it's about getting the max value. If we bet small here, we force villain to call more stuff than the jack-x that we block and to raise stuff, right? We get those raises in while having pocket jacks. And yeah, it's just pretty cool. I see reason for checking king-jack as well, letting in position blast with the straws if he's overdoing it versus check. King-jack is just way more vulnerable, right? It wants to get the money in right now against other two pairs and against other stuff. But if villain is blasting too much, absolutely. Right here, it's more blocking than checking because every king wants to bet and so on. So we have it in that line, but would make sense. Well, it's tough to find a villain who is blasting on that board, let's say. But yeah, if they bet, they are 10-9 all the time. They're 9-8 all the time, they're 10-8 all the time. Perfect. What does King-Jack want? Not to bet. Remember that, right? King-Jack wants to build the pot as huge as possible. And if that is happening by checking, perfect, even better. Yeah, I think I actually have to stick to one example. Let's have, I show one more, one more. I thought we have a little more time, but let's go to example number two, King, King three, because I wanted to show you a real range bet for it. Even GTO wizard is range betting, right? Think about the deuce, the 10 and the ace. And I want to show you one brick. Let's go with the deuce and the ace. This is what we can squeeze into the session today. Okay, so the deuce and the ace, and let's have a look here. Didn't look for the suits now, but it doesn't matter. We'll take the deuce of clubs. So an offsuit deuce, and first of all, I will show you flop strategy. This is what we call range bet board, right? Small or half, not a big bet. It doesn't make sense. We're attacking all the jack nine offs suits that the villain is having and now it's the question what are we doing on the deuce block plus 150 kirill why why do you think 150 is a good idea on that turn more check side and 50 two one third okay now i'm asking you a question what is your turn betting frequency with ace king i want to see frequency numbers something between zero and 100 how often are you betting ace king on the turn on that deuce 180 100 0 50 oh here we go we can learn something 20 70 i love it okay so we should agree on something, right? Something has to be the best. Something has to be the best. I don't know. That's a good answer. I'm betting ASKING 100. If you could add why you're doing that, that would be even better. But now the solver is not betting that very often, but sometimes I would say. And we see a clear pattern again. i love those patterns. So first of all, lookalikes. We are block betting like we're checking a deuce. So this is what we are doing with our deuces. Deuces try to stack a king. We don't need to bet to get value from a king. Pocket threes, same thing, small bet or check. Ace-X should be floating a lot, which we have dead with ace-king. Oh, the lookalike with the ace, right. We want to check most of our ace x on the turn right and villains bluffs which means he is stabbing the turn he invests money on the turn is mainly not having an ace so when we have an ace it's more likely that villain invests money this is how we should see it it's's not really hand versus hand. It's just our block effect. We have an ace. It's more likely that villain will throw money in the middle on the turn. So we just check and let him do that. And ace king is not missing out on anything. Ace king wants to stack king queen and king jack and they are betting. Exactly. You try to get a check call. Maybe. It depends on villain size. Let's have a look. Let's have a look. If villain stabs half pot, we can check call indeed, right? So we check call. Let's get a non-straight card there, seven. Check. Villain now bets something more, 30. Okay. 150% pot with every king. and here we are still having ace king in the block bet check call turn line to then check jam the river isn't that cool i think that's pretty cool right so now again cornerstones i wrote it on one of the slides aces is the same like ace x right this fits very often that pattern ace kingking is on the one hand a king but on the other hand it's an ace right so how do we want to play ace-high this helps you a lot a lot a lot a lot usually still king-queen does lots of checking because lots of queen-highs are checking queens are checking because lots of queen-highs are checking while something like a king-nine king-eight is more on the betting side we are these are our main bluffs right so it's things go hand in hand right obviously solver is playing against other solver who react perfectly to everything in our world we can be way more way more strict with that with local likes and so on so i like that a lot and instead of just always having value but when we bet right it's like and actually like the one that people trap like pocket kings is the first one you should always bet there's like no one will be betting if you have kings it's like you play against all the ace highs maybe the other peers okay so that was a fun one and now let's have a look on the ace now your Chad. What is the betting strategy when the turn is an ace? I'm not asking for a hand. I'm asking for the bet sizes that we use. Turn is the offsuit ace, ace of clubs. What are the bet sizes you want to be using? One third, okay, small. 75 and 150, that's not small. 50%, which sounds like I don't know what I tried to achieve with my size. No offense. Block or check, okay? So let's think about that. Everyone has all the aces, right? I mean, we have some of the better aces. Let's think about how much value do you have if you have an ace? How much more value? If you turn an ace, let's say you have ace-jack, turn is an ace. How much more value do you try to get have an ace how much more value if you turn an ace let's say you have ace jack turn as an ace how much more value do you try to get really three streets and smaller size with the best ace x one more bet one more bet one more bet when do you think should we take our bet river here we go right ace jack doesn't need to deny equity let him blast his 10 9 give him a chance Give him a chance to take his 4-5 backdoor. Give him a chance to do something, right? So here we go, Montas. That's it, right? If our ace-axe doesn't want to value bet the turn, the next better hand is a freaking king. And a freaking king wants to attack an ace. And to attack an ace, hell no, we go 33%. Hell no, we go 50%. I don't know. That's just what I guess. But I have a pretty good guess, I hope. I really hope I don't look like a fool now. But this is what we see. Hell no, you're 33%. Hell no, you're 50%. Hell no, the 75%. Let's go with it this year, right? Actually, we don't need to check. We don't need to bet too much. We don't need to bet. We bet our pocket threes. Interesting that we bet the threes and check the deuces. I don't really get that part, to be honest. Oh, sorry. We don't have a set with deuces. I've already counted the river card, and now I get it that we bet a and we check deuces okay so we actually do not read are not really interested in this year right actually i would simplify that away and don't bet at all i don't need to open up this year for ace jack like this sizing's this in between that we have two percent four percent it's just made for this region of ace x so we go good king or bullshit that's it right let's have a look how villain should react we go 125 oh not check here we go 125. villain turns and ace is indifferent it's like how great is that he turns the top here and sees our bat and is just like my life that feels great and yeah just put yourself into that position like you turn that ace villain over bets like oh yes hello pretty cool it's important to understand okay there's no equity to be denied if the turn is a queen different story different story i think because they are still the value and denying equity from an ace here we are way more using smaller sizes a queen wants to bet way more often than an ace wants to do, like queen, jack, just denying that equity from an ace. It's very important because there are incredibly many ace-axe combinations out there. So the ace is just a very, very, very special card. If we bet and villain folds, he probably had 0% equity, which is really a zero achievement. Let's have a look. Again, ace of clubs. We would bet half pot. All those hands that Willen is folding, he just folded 0%. This is something I don't want to achieve. Against this year, we have our one street value. On the river, if we bet half pot now, Will and Coles, let's say we have the strongest ace. Let's get a river, random river, four. We have a block bet. Congratulations. We go half pot and block bet, which is exactly the same like just betting check, check, keeping your range together, betting 75% on the river or even a little bigger let's have a look after the check check river brick and we can bet against any ace we block bet because villain raises an ace or we overbet interesting villain is raising the aces so we don't care so in our games i think we just go with the sizing we want and i would slightly overbet with ace queen to be honest okay i think that was fun we have seen some non-standard boards if you want to look up one more i have this one prepared to go through with you but the time is over already so the king jack three are very typical almost range bet boards solver is mixing that up it just means that if we only offered one sizing it we could get away with the range bet we could bet everything and you can see again i offered the the full brick the very bad card and the in-between card and this will help you just go with the worst go with the best and one in between and you have a good idea how to play those spots and now to finish wrap things up a little exploitative thoughts to not make you check everything right but i want you to have that thought about building pots not about betting it's so easy i have something i want to bet i have something i want to bet i have something like it's like stupid right if villain is a good player he will help you to build a pot and your hand only cares about building a pot so now this is what we need to evaluate the passive villain means we need to go with a batch heavy strategy we will realize equity better by betting and we will get more value by betting right especially talking about our strong hands obviously i'm not checking my mid set if he never bets a bluff i'm just blasting against his top pair obviously right as all of you are doing and this is why it's not wrong what you are doing necessarily if you play a little lower people are usually a little too passive people are usually a little too call happy with certain hands so it's good to charge that right against aggressive villains that on your way up you face more and more, or maybe in your local casino, you have that one special young kid who just tries to run over you. Now you know how to tackle that. Let him build the pot. That's cool. Just put your strong hands in the checking range, right? Then we play a more check-heavy strategy and let the villain hang himself. Okay, so now I hope you hope you this is the most important point actually the best exploit is that you now realized how unnatural many traps are how wrong most of you in the chat were playing and all of you were honest i hope and you wrote yes i'm betting this set i'm betting this set i'm getting that set and same with flushes and straights turn will be the big blind as well. Attack, attack, attack when they don't go for it. They won't have the checked set. They won't have the whatever. And you see how much Pio is bluffing or GTO wizard. And if you know that villain is even checking with a way weaker range and not check raising, how freaking printing must, like all the bluffs must be. All right, key takeaways. Evaluate turn card to come up with a good sizing plan. In my head, that works like that. What we learned in the paint game. Evaluating how that turn card influences things. How not protected is villain? Which parts am I trying to attack? How much money do I want to invest overall with my range? More the small sizing, more the big sizing. How big can I go? Second point is the cornerstones of my range. I work a lot with the set lookalikes and with the flushes and straights, I'm more randomizing, right? But they give me so much like something to hold on. I know I'm protected. I know I have this, right? The aces with ace high, the ace king. Are you aware Severino said said on the king, king, three deuce, that ace king is even a cool check call. We don't need to deny any equity. The king will bet again. So we can delay that and still have the super nuts in that range. How cool is that, right? And now one more thing, especially out of position, that if you look up the solver, don't try to learn the mix. See it as it doesn't matter. If villain is aggressive, you go for the more passive way. If villain is more passive, you go for the more aggressive way. If you don't know, you can mix kind of randomly. There are small incentives to do one thing more with one hand and one thing more with the other, but this is really tiny stuff. So very important here important here to be aware of villains aggression level. I just did a database review of lots of villains I'm playing against and therefore blind versus blind. I can tell you, I have numbers, how often they step versus a check. They were from, I think 34 was the lowest for a wreck and 58 was the highest. So very, very different numbers against the one guy. I never want to check a value hand against the other guy. I want to always check anything pretty much. Yeah, let's go. I hope you enjoyed that one. And I hope you will enjoy actually in the add-ons, I will play a little in the gto wizard drill and we'll take three in-depth looks on turn strategy there so it will be a little four videos just like five to ten minutes you can watch it on the go as a little add-on to round out around up the session and yeah good luck at the tables put in some 275 percent bats and especially when you are the big blind hammer on them all right have a good one guys i'm i'm out for now
