### TOPIC: cash postflop bluff catching
 So as I wrote, I hope you guys used your time well and maybe just like brainstormed a little already for like, how do you think in those bluff catch situations? Where do we face those bluff catch situations? Since you mostly, you guys are playing tournaments and you might've heard that I'm mainly playing cash these days or pretty much just cash. I was looking for a topic where it's not really about like ranges and we cannot discuss with each other. So it's more like a very, very general topic where we just, today it's about just like clearing up minds, like raising awareness for what do we want to be looking at? What can be there? What potential REITs can we have, et cetera. I guess then we are ready to start. So today we will start with a couple of examples and then I'll try to define the situation a little better. What do we mean with just bluff catching? Where do we find these spots? How can they be different or not? Then we'll talk about if we look up things in PIO, what do we learn from it? And we talk about the PIO baseline, how is a river calling range structured in the end? What kind of like jobs are there to be done by certain hands? And then we'll get to the main part today, actually, which is exploitive thoughts and approaches, right? It's not like we are playing PIO and bluff catching is just in the end, such a black or white situation where it's like, okay, we end up calling or we end up folding. Okay. We can randomize something in between, but still our goal is to, oh, we'll talk about that later. What actually our goal is, right? Our goal is to make good decisions and then we'll put some ideas in there. We will collect them together as well. And then we'll maybe have another few examples, not actually hand examples there. I didn't find like within 15 minutes, the perfect ones. So I just like described some. And then in the end to wrap the whole thing up, I really want to give you like, put some structure into it that you leave that session and feel like, okay, next time I'm in such a spot, I don't feel lost because I have a clear plan what I do step-by-step kind of. That's the goal of today's session. And another preview for if I were to give you a homework, right? If I were a school teacher now, and I'm not that, but still I would recommend doing that in the end. It will be, I want to give you a plan as well to know, okay, if I want to work on something that I can do off-game, for example, notes, what can I do right after the session? I look up my yesterday's tournament hand histories and then double-check, like, okay, maybe we can write down reads. It's tough with anonymized hands, I guess, on GG, for example, but we can keep that in mind like when we play those situations. What do we want to write down? Okay, I'm just reading the chat whether something went wrong there and then we'll keep going. We will start with examples. We will define the situation of bluff catching. We will have a look at the PIO baseline, what we learn from that. Then we share exploitive thoughts and approaches. And by sharing, I really mean like we do that more or less together. And then we go through some examples, what can be happening and in the end, putting some structure into it. So we got six players so far. Come on, hurry up guys. Okay. One more minute. Let's go guys. We have been a couple more. Good to go. Okay. I think I don't have have to show that screen you see that on your screen now as well so this is now just let's start with that little brainstorm what do you consider when being in a bluff catch situation i just want to collect like is two minutes of time just collect all ideas that like whatever you might think about right like write down any kind of shit because i will try to put structure into all those thoughts during that presentation so i was just thinking about what i had in my mind so far but i hopefully get to know more now and then i can try to to talk about that as well in like the upcoming 90 minutes nine answers go on halftime we get we get a little more igor what about you come up with something fancy here opponent's range our perceived range unblocking bluffs opponent's tendencies buy in stakes very good so uh what the fuck is that how can i read that now wow igor that looks like a fancy toy game that program you sent me here sorting the ideas okay very good let's just give it a quick view villain trying to push me off nut advantage blockers size of his bed very good does his bedding line bed size make sense icm pressure okay guys we forget icm pressure today we are just playing chip eb as long as I'm around. But very good thing, obviously. River card improves villain ranges or heroes. Okay, how does the new card interact with the given ranges? MDF, we use fancy like shortcuts now. Minimum defense frequency on river. Blocking value, unblocking bluffs. How many stars and bluff villain has? Okay. Type of player he is. Is he a thinking player? So I tried to structure that a little because I'm not really happy with the structure that Kahoot is like not the best poker program, I guess, put in there. So what I see is player tendencies, lots of player tendencies. Then board development is something I see, like does the river card improve me etc sizing obviously what is like in theory some kind of baseline how often should i call right then we see something actually before sizing is like not advantage okay that leads to like which sizing should be used if story makes sense what what is that talking about it's like okay we don't just talk about the situation right now on the river but actually we think about the the whole storyline right which starts pre-flop right it's like when we have face a river situation it would be good to still know whether he open raised to 2x or to 3x or to know whether he bet 20 on the flop or Or was it 60, right? Not forgetting that kind of stuff or having kind of a helping tool that reminds you of that. Then I obviously read a lot about blockers and as well, which I like a lot, unblockers. Equity, okay, is like one of those terms you can always throw out there, but without a special meaning, I meaning i feel like blockers unblocking bluffs stack sizes okay really now we talked about the past you said icm and like and like stack sizes which leads to for me as well okay future game maybe right it's like okay let's talk about tournament if i'm forced to i can do that right let's talk about future again what do we leave him behind in which situation which situation offer we him right we offer him two options pretty much call or fold or race maybe but let's not talk about that where he is doing that to us and it's like okay different stack sizes have different value and it's not necessarily linear on a final table for example the opponent's range put maximal pressure on the board want to put pressure on my villain, the board. I think it's a solid board most of the time. Story makes sense, tendencies, tendencies. I guess that's it pretty much. So here we have a long list, player tendencies, population tendencies, board texture, pot odds, or hand range, how the action played out, preflop, river. Okay, lots of that stuff. I tried to combine those like a little to some kind of keywords like that okay past future like the situation itself player tendencies sport developments it's just lots of things where we actually really face the problem of bluff catching already there's so much and now like i want to start off with like what i see as the biggest risk especially when it's kind of emotional right we are playing a final table we're playing for big monies that we are not necessarily used to we play like whatever right and then one of the big risks is because we have so many tools or like ideas to decide whether we are calling or not in the end that we just do what we emotionally want to do right it's like i freaking want to call it's like my feeling and then i have all those tools and what happens is because i have that feeling i just want to find something i want to find a reason that justifies the. And let's say we have six, seven, eight different options we can look at. But once I find the first reason, oh, I'm blocking value. Nice. That's the best one, right? I'm blocking value, not even considering what I'm unblocking or like, do I block bluffs at the same time? Maybe forget about it, right? First instinct, I block value. So I call, I can justify it. And I i and i think like i'm i mean sucks to really like compliment yourself but i'm one of the best when it comes to justifying i can sell you bullshit hands for like that they make sense i'm pretty sure of that so it's like really this is one of the biggest risks and after today's lesson we want to get a little rid of that at least to have like some analytical mind in the back of all our emotions that says like okay fuck those blockers for now let's first think maybe about other as well important things okay so thanks for all that input here we lost a little blockers missed draws okay top or bottom range of looking at your own range. We didn't have that so far. Has he been bluffing nonstop? Okay, dynamic. Like we get even more stuff here. Kind of dynamic playing the same people over and over again. Press the 50% when unsure. Okay, perfect. So let's continue and let's see what is next. We continue with a couple of examples where I just want to test you more or less. You see the hand, I'll talk you through the hand, and then we'll just do a little voting of like whether we should call or not. And something went wrong there because I obviously tried to hide, which did not work at all. I tried, yeah, I had to redo the whole thing before. So you see that I ended up calling, but still, what would you do? Maybe I was good. Maybe not. We at least don't see that. And this is a blind versus blind situation where I'm playing versus a good cash game player. It's his name is Nick Marchington. He was on the World Series of Poker final table like two or three years ago. He open raises to 3x on L2K game and the small blind so far so standard he c-bets small on that board you can have multiple options here i'm calling with my backdoors turn i bink my top here he bets 75 i call river is a full brick i bet 75 i decided to call what do you think is the play. What do you do in that spot? And try to think that through, like, even, I mean, you see my answer, and it's easy to copy that one. But, yeah, next. Okay, great scoreboard. Here we go. This is the one. Now this is working. I hope you found that now. Call or fold, two options, that's easier. We learn together. The triangle is call and the rectangle is fold. We obviously all call and we just go to the next one. And now we'll go through the hand and then I'll show Kahoot. So as I said, we are learning together today, okay? Okay, so next hand heads up against the same guy. And I'm open raising ace 10. I'm checking back on 983. I'm checking back on a king turn and face again. If we deduct rake from that pot, a 75% hotkey bet. And one fold in the chat from Stuart. Okay, a nice little 40, 60, right? So, I mean, I could talk you through now why I decided to call, whether it's like good, what do the cards tell us? Okay, it's the Ace of Hearts, kind of an interesting card. It's the Ten of Clubs, a key card. Now we can talk about blockers. I could talk about his tendencies, whatever, right? It's like we don't know so far. It's just like let's try out a little more. Let's see this now we are playing a three bet pot i'm open raising on the button dreamy dom zoom 500 regular is three betting to 12 big blinds i'm calling so far so standard he c bets half pot i call turn is an offsuit jack he c-bets half pot again i call river is the six of spades he jams which is like 55 percent pot in the end and i have top pair and i call yeah i guess i'm bluff catching but again question to you we call or we fold all good steward glad that you're here and you're calling okay this time we have just a couple of knits who fold their top here because they know they always have it I can give you at least the outcome of the hand he had king queen offsuit but first of all we could say like okay like does it make our call a little better or worse but if we fold queen 10 we can talk about is this king queen even a value bet like okay so just another one and now coming to the last one which is this one first time i decided to fold i'm open raising the small blind another zoom 500 rack three bets from the big blind i defend i check the flop and he decides to check back queen six deuce rainbow i turn my top here but it's a very bad card for my range i'd say so i check again he checks back river pierce the queen and i'm going for value and he decides to raise to what i don't even know what what what certain percentage that is of the pot but to like some like manually typed in or like scrolled 192 5050. It's like, maybe you see like what I'm talking about right away when talking about the hands, which will be stuff we'll be looking at. And let's see whether you guys call or fold with your freaking top pair here. It's called top two. Call is red triangle. Okay. So here are kind of an even thing. We're again,'re again right what now it's not about whether we call or fold but just i want to take you through the process of thinking maybe everyone for himself just think about what did you actually think through what is your reasoning behind that i will talk about reasons for calling or folding from now on and well maybe we'll we'll discuss those hands in the end if we have some time let's now define the situation so bluff catching for me now right we talk about bluff catching today is just every time for me it's on the river right before obviously we can start bluff catching on the turn when our hand is just a bluff catcher but actually there's one more card to come and makes it tougher because to think that through we already need to like know something about how to continue playing on like rivers how does villain continue playing on rivers do i still have equity against his value range like how often does he bluff and then give up how often does he bluff and then bluff through etc etc so we really to do the basic stuff. We face a bet on the river and we call or fold. So that's the thing. And now it's just first step is to think about, okay, what do we know? What is like the information we can access to make our decision? And we want to make the best decision in the end with the given information. So I just tried to down okay here what do i know so far i know the line he took right important to remember right i said that already how much did he open raise to what was his flop sizing what was his turn sizing it's like was it four way on the flop or not so whenever you're facing that decision you should be like just you should remember and go through that again before snap clicking sometimes that was like one of the new year's resolutions i gave to myself was take more time on river decisions because i like snap clicking a lot which is just like sometimes i rip your hands and see like well what the fuck what did you do on the flop like he sized up there already which could mean something so i want to force myself now for this year and it's like and you can do that from now on it's just take a little more time and think about okay what was his actual line what am i calling you're not just calling riverbed you're calling pretty much a story that starts on pre-flop continues on on the flop, and on the turn. Okay, then next thing is not just the line, but the sizing pattern. You should know that. You see, you should know. I said that already, right? Was it 2.5x? Was it 3x? How much did he 3-bet to? Was it like, did he click hotkeys? Or did he like, did he click 75% on the turn? Or did he size up to like 90%? And now that's like a fancy manually typed in 120%. That's very, very interesting. What does that tell us? Because we are trying to find out something about Villain's range. And we need to work backwards. And what Villain does usually is just he looks at his hand that's what worst players do or people think about their range that's definitely better to come up with certain sizings right so we will talk about something like a sizing i call it sizing triggered by hand which is just i look down at my hand i want to bet a certain amount just because this is the value that hand is. But at the same time, when you work like that, you pretty much reveal the information of what your hand could be. So how I work is more like, okay, I think about my range, which sizings do I want to use in general? And then I give myself options, which is like one or two or three options maximum. And then I look at my hand, where does that fit into? So I'm at least playing some kind of ranges, but, oh, we are not just playing against very, very genius players. And actually when it comes to bluff catching, it's way more important to play correctly against the non, not so genius players. Against the genius players, I can tell you like the first big 25K I played, like Ike Haxton was like one of the idols I had there. And I just approached it like, okay, it's Ike Haxton, like he will have his bluffs kind of. So what I do in those bluff catch situations, his range will be good. And then it does not matter. That was like, does it really matter then? Or like are there other spots where I clearly want to make a great decision? Okay, so that was now talking about sizing pattern. Last thing I wrote down here is just the sizing itself now, because it just gives me like the whole thing of the situation. It's like, do I face a 150% bet, a three times pot jam, or just a little block bet? Totally different spot. And now coming to that, what I wrote down here is what is actually our goal? And there is only one goal, right? It's to find out whether villain is bluff or value heavy. And I want to tell you a very little story. I'm not sure whether I can call out his name, but it was a former flatmate of mine. I had a very, very, very successful tournament player who does some coaching on the side as well. And he like, like whenever he was asking for reads, he had like that weird way of asking. He was asking, hey, there's like this cash player. You should probably know him. And he asked, can this guy bluff? To just like get reads from me because I played him a lot. So can this guy bluff? Where I hope from now what I talked about is like something you can feel it right away that the question does not make any sense. So because I always, which is true for pretty much all good cash game players, I have answer with I had to answer with yes right and then maybe it was even in game right that he like then used that as a justification for calling and when I answer like this guy can bluff which is like the totally wrong question and I answer yes but actually it was like yes but and i would follow up always with like yes that guy but he's clearly value heavy in big spots right and then it's like okay that sucks right so don't like this is a trap it feels emotionally very very bad to get bluffed and it's like just think of the life table we have all seen those high stakes like whatever poker after after dark, high stakes poker, where people like go crazy sometimes. And then they show bluffs. And the one guy looks like an idiot, right? Throwing away like kind of a strong hand. But, well, if we look at the spot, it is just allowed to bluff in poker. It's okay to get bluffed. And that is so important. And we want to shift that thing to like, right, by asking that like right by asking that question in different ways like is there any chance that he's bluff or value heavy that is our only job to find that out yeah so my former roommate ended up calling all the time and that that fancy fedor guy who who is in the chat apparently he was never my roommate but he's like kind of the same team so yeah he was somewhat successful with it as well but it's it's like just like yeah the question just does not make sense so yeah this is something to keep in mind our goal is to find out whether villain is bluff or value heavy that's the only thing and now what we do in the next step is this year if you guys have ever seen me me, if you have been in my Poker Academy coaching, or you have seen it on the Poker Code platform, or you have seen me streaming like at least one time, because I'm repeating that every single time I'm talking about poker, is my three steps of thinking about poker. And I always start with what would be right. I actually just talked about that. It's right to get bluffed sometimes. And then the next steps is what is villain doing wrong? And then what is the right exploit? Today, we will talk a little about the first question and then mainly about the second one. The third one is pretty easy because there's no future game, like at least if we are playing cash game right future game maybe in tournaments there is a little but it's like makes it super easy because if someone is value heavy well we fold our bluff catchers and if someone is bluff heavy we call them right and maybe raise even more like bluff catchers that we cannot call because they are shit themselves right that would be another kind of more crazy exploit but actually we don't need in that situation we don't need to talk about the third spot too much so it's really we'll start with what would be right. So we'll look a little at the PIO baseline. Okay, let's talk about the PIO baseline. It's just a given thing that in a perfect strategy, the EV of bluff catching is around zero. Whenever you look up something in PIO, you have a bluff catcher and villainous is PIO, your EV is around zero. There are some influences, whether it's like slightly plus or slightly minus. This is mainly caused by blockers or just caused by blockers. But then we were talking about something like we're playing a thousand dollar pot and it's about plus twenty dollars or minus twenty dollars but this is well this is the baseline right if villain is playing correctly we'll talk about the exploitive part later and now i want to first think of like how is the river calling range structured to not just say okay i have bluff catcher bluff catcher whatever i have it i don't have it it's like maybe take like a couple of seconds and think for yourself think about your calling range in just any given spot as general as possible how is it structured i just yeah first thought don't need to write it just like for yourself and i'll just continue in 20 seconds and show you how i think about that it's nothing no rocket science but just think about it first before just reading what i write down okay so now i'll just show you what i think about or like how i think about a structured river range right so first thing is snap calls we beat value hands raises when not or like we raise that when we are not facing an all-in even. Like really, really, really, we just freaking have it. Next thing for me is like, let's call it trying calls where I say like, okay, let's be a little more precise. I find a certain value threshold. I'm not folding any hand. Like I don't care about blockers whatever i might even not bear a beat like most of his value hands or like any of his value hands but this is just a certain value threshold that i'm not folding what is that for that means in the end i need that therefore that villain cannot value bet any thinner right so sometimes there's stuff okay he's going's going super huge. So he's maybe just, let's say, wrapping the river set. Obviously, if his range is really like that, then it would be best to just call off something that blocks that freaking river set. But if I only call that, well, maybe I'm ending up with just calling like third peer or fourth peer. And and with that line he can just like value jam some or we get into weird situations where villain actually like was bluffing with the best hand and well we all hopefully know that great feeling of bluffing getting called and then somehow winning the pot so it's just something that hand is just there for for making sure that villain cannot like value bet than he should. And then we get to the next ones, which is for me, what we are talking about today, just the clear bluff catchers. It's like, okay, we have bluff catchers. And those are mainly those for me that are in PIO kind of mixes because they are more or less 0 EV. And then we have snap falls right as soon as we lose to some of villains bluffs well or just have a busted draw ourselves this is just nothing we can do right we have to fold up our hands so this is how i want to put that structure in and just to explain that one more time i wanted to like i come up with one example and what i did here is just run a quick sim. Big blind versus button, three bet pot. We are playing cash game ranges. Sorry for that. And the big blind goes with 30% on the flop on king, eight deuce, turn polarizing his range, 65%, and then another 65% on the river. And this is we're facing an all in pretty much. And what we see here is we have snap calls. We beat value hands. We have freaking ace king. We have freaking pocket eights, pocket deuces, pocket threes that we did float on the flop. We have king eight suited sometimes. Pretty cool, right? So very, very easy. Then we have the crying calls. It's like a certain value threshold. For me, this is something like, King-5 suited, right? We have the freaking top pair. Obviously, it has to do with blockers as well. But this is just for me with wider ranges, that's a little tougher. But then there's a certain value threshold where I say, okay, I'm not holding top pair, right? Because what does that mean in the end? Well, villain cannot like value bet any, whatever. If I just, if I fold my king five and call my ace eight and only call like my king queen and his king jack, well, in the end, theoretically, villain could end up dribbling like pocket queens and make it plus cd, something like that. This is just like, would lead to a weird structure. So this is how I see it. And then the next best hands, those are my bluff catch bluff catchers we're like something like pocket jacks is a bluff catcher pocket sixes is a bluff catcher ace three is a bluff catcher as well it's just a very good one this is why it gets called 100 ace queen is a bluff catcher it beats all bluffs villain shouldn't be bluffing with a pocket pair well pocket queens is just one pip worse than my king five and it's actually the best of my bluff catchers but apparently has the worst blocker given certain ranges here. Like okay seven eight eight nine these are all bluff catchers obviously some like my four five float from the flop is one of those snap folds. Ace jack is actually a bluff catcher as well right it's just like a little over zero it's like a very bad bluff catcher something like i mean five six four five are actually the only snap faults we're having here they are not really busted draws so this is just like the pyro baseline if we think about that and this is another problem that i want to show up today is just if we only run sims like that and see like yeah it's like whatever it's zero ev well it's just you found out nothing right it's like your hand is zero ev against someone who plays perfectly and calling or falling buff catchers is like does not matter at all and with the question chat why jacks to nines are sometimes a call and not queen queen that is just a very very very very very very tiny thing because villain bluffs a little more queen x than he does bluff with like 10x or 9x if we look at the uv i don't know whether it's big enough for you we see that queens on average have like minus seven dollars and we are talking about a thousand dollar pot here and pocket tens have like 43 cents plus we're like okay if villain is just playing a little little different then maybe queens are way better than tense right we cannot know that it's just if we play a pile in that way so doing those sims and not then discussing in the end whether tense is the better call or queens is just a freaking waste of time because you are talking about like gaining 0.0 something percent edges in something where you cannot know what villain is exactly doing so this is just something right i want to have that structure in my in my mind to find those things we're like right ending up folding your king nine here that is there would be a clear exploit right it's like it's giving up on ev that should be there and this is one of those hands that are just calls against a certain pre-range we are starting with i mean here we did not talk about like villains tendencies on flop turn and pre-flop but okay this is like the first idea okay this is how a river calling range is structured and this is why we always just talk about blockers actually when we look at pyosims because pyo we don't have any clear reads or anything and then it's just we're talking about so small things where this is just what is so important for me here that this is mainly useless it makes sense to understand that that sometimes you need to call a zero ev bluff catcher. But whether you call 100% 9s and never 10s does not matter. But if villain knows that, then he can bluff with 9x and give up with 10x. But I mean, this is just, this is bullshit. So actually, what I want to do in-game is identify I have a 0 EV catcher and think about other stuff, right? And we'll get to that. And now this was already for this year, right? For the Pio baseline, we can look at Pio regarding bluff catching a lot, right? And find out certain stuff. But like in the end, it's kind of whatever because Pio designs everything that bluff catches are zero EV. When we play with tighter ranges in the end, obviously some blockers are more important and we have like yeah small ev differences a little bigger than those but like not really big so we want to be on the exploitive side so we guys or you guys play tournaments and as like lots of smart poker players say that everyone is shit in tournaments well we are mainly playing against bad players which is great because that gives us like ev in the end right an edge over the field and now i just gather a little okay exploitive thoughts and approaches what you think about what do i think about again would be better to ask you first but now this is where we are and i split it up into something like villain- greets and board based basis okay this is a typo but right this is something to think about what happened what does villain do wrong given just what does he do wrong with his river sizing does it tell us something does he do something like exploitively on the turn already sizing pattern he sizes up, if he bets 75% on the turn and later more, et cetera. Line tail, whatever. Yeah, board-based stuff is just, okay, how can a board develop in the end, right? And this is something I always want to know the baseline, what would be right for villain as well. what would be villains bluffs and in reality how likely is it that he bluffs that so maybe you have seen the cash game stream i did with fedor where we started off with like a kind of a zero ev catch where we both agreed after that that's like a hand you should always be folding because it was just what was the board he c-bats on ace three five turn is a deuce goes check check check ace three five deuce river is a seven and the backdoor flush draw gets there and villain bets big ace three five do seven flush draw got there like what are his freaking bluffs there are none of those i call the natural bluffs all right so this is probably the next slide start with those board based stuff right so let's just see what's on here any solver will bet the right ratio but your villains won't so the board run out often dictates how easy it is to over bluff under bluff and still remember bluffs are allowed it's fine if villain bluffs you sometimes it's not okay if he over bluffs and gets it through so yeah natural bluffs for me is that if just like every idiot in the world understands that he needs to bluff that if he ends up he calls an open ender goes check check on the turn he has nine high on the river this is a natural bluff unnatural bluff is just what i was talking about in that example ace three five deuce seven backdoor flush gets in there villain bets big after check calling a flop bet what are his bluffs well actually they should be three x and five x that he called on the flop but this is how i wrote it down here hands that would have showdown value on other runouts but are relatively weak now so it's about that absolute relative hand strength that there's lots of talk about talk about so it's really that okay he called on the flop because he has a freaking mid pair and this is stuck in his mind three mid pair bottom pair five mid pair that triggers i have showdown value so now the board changes that all of his freaking air that he called on the flop all his gut shots has something his backdoor flush stroke up there whatever and then well now he has to have that shift of thought where it's like okay my 5x 3x are my worst hands in my range i'm just so far down it's just very very unnatural yes so here's a very good thing that is important for everyone the lower you play the less unnatural bluffs you will find in rec population something to note 100 right the worse%. The worse the player, the less he will understand that. It's just like, oh, I have something I checked, maybe I wouldn't show it on. And at the same time, the lower you are, the more those natural bluffs get over bluffed. So I'll come up with two examples now to just show that. We're here, the first one is this one. I open raise on the cutoff with ace-jack and an unknown player, recreational player, clearly calls in the big blind. So we can talk about whether a small c-bet makes sense here. I went for it against that kind of player and we can think about now that we can already have like certain other reads that I don't even want to talk about that this recreational player is probably not check raising six seven as much as he should that he's not check raising jack ten queen ten queen jack five seven five six in the right frequency something like maybe ace seven ace ten with a backdoor flush draw ace five ace three with a backdoor not flush draw probably not happening so he's maybe calling all those hands turns a full break river even pierce the eight and then on the river he comes there betting half pot so yeah usually like this now some putting some population tendency in there that like when a recreational player has an eight here he's not betting half pot he's betting a different amount so maybe this is a nine or this is five six five seven seven six ten seven ten six jack ten queen ten queen jack or even bluffing king high which is a hand that has well relatively massive amount of showdown value but i'm giving up some bullshit on the turn i cannot barrel everything right and then can i start like bluffing everything on the river again no his king jack should actually win sometimes at showdown what do i do with king 10 without clubs so he bluffed something and i i mean that's what i'm calling any ace high like all day long against that sizing of a recreational player. So this is just like one where it's super super super easy to overbluff and that would be one spot where it's like it helps, you know the baseline, it would be correct for villain to not bluff his queen jack, to not bluff his queen 10 because it's just yeah it's just too high up in his range and so therefore it's super super easy to over bluff and now the other way around other hand now we play against a good player zoom 500 player i open raise from the button big blind calls well i thought we play against croc d so let's say like maybe like okay zoom 500 player i see bad small on that flop where i can probably just bet whole range turn goes check check on that nine so it would be great if the river was the four of clubs but i mean we cannot choose too much for the example sake of the example but now let's think about what are his natural bluffs say his natural floats on the flop are jack nine queen jack queen nine queen yeah queen jack did i say that yeah We're like that nine just improves all of that shit. And now while he's betting big, no, actually king eight fits perfectly already in one of those crying calling hands for me. Like I cannot fold a king here, but I don't expect to win really. It's like, is he value betting king five with a big sizing? It's ambitious, I would say. Like it's close. Is he value betting any other burst stuff? Probably not. So in the end, I'm blocking a king, which is good, but I'm actually in a bluff catch situation. And if we think about it, there are not many natural bluffs. And he's someone who actually like, I think bluffing all ace queens here is like clearly over bluffing but he definitely understood the spot and i would have been i would have been over folding against him here i'm not like i'm not calling any 10 here against most players and it's like because i tried to do that as an exploit it's just like okay he maybe has like some ace highs with a backdoor flush draw that he check called on the flop but that's about it right so he has to understand that all his shit just has pierce now so he needs to find for a bluff something else that ace queen clearly had showed up had the plan of checking down when it called on the flop so it's kind of small stuff where we see okay this would be a stuff as a spot where the weaker the player i can see on let's say in a big 11 on the final table, I can see myself holding king-8 here. So, yeah, stuff like that. And now, I guess, where was that? No, it sucks that I have no clue what comes up next in Kahoot. But, okay. Now, I want to sort those things, and this is what you guys missed already. Yeah, this was the last one. So, one so after that we'll be in line again I made that little graphic here to visualize the whole things so we have learned about a couple of things already that we can look at to find out whether villain is likely bluff heavy or value heavy and the main most important thing really we learned already that the goal is just to find out that not forget that question can he have bluffs does not exist anymore so now i made that little graphic and what that should show is pretty much like a line graph pretty much four line graphs see it as four different line graphs that red line just shows this is zero ev we're like okay i would say whenever we are playing against pio whatever we do is zero ev just playing pio would be just on that red line and now we can think about certain influences and let's see the first black line graph as something that means okay when we look at that when we look at that certain thing that i'm looking for here actually that influences our decision i can make a little ev up right like i can make instead of making zero ev decisions i can find a little something to work around that i'm like make a little plus ev decisions or that i can find out that villain is slightly bluff heavy or slightly value heavy the second thing is for me something where okay we find out that okay we we have an idea that villain is like we have a better idea whether he's bluff or value heavy then one step further and the last one is like okay actually this can really tell us something this is something where it's it's really that yeah that thing where it's like okay we know this guy is bluffing now this guy has it right sometimes we can make those black and white reads so actually the kahoot thing you missed unfortunately because i clicked too early is just sort those things i gave you the four names that I'm looking for and those were, I just write it down here, was sizing tell, was blockers, was sizing pattern tell and was line tell. Pretty much with line tell I mean read on earlier streets behavior. Let's say for example he's jamming the river but we know oh he check raises value heavy this would be a reason now that he's probably ending up value heavy that would be a line tell if we just know he check raises value heavy and now we are on the river facing that jam right sizing pattern tail would be more something what he does like how does he change his sizing so it's kind of they are kind of familiar but a little different and now maybe just we cannot do it in Kahoot, but okay, just do it for yourself. I'll take a one minute talk break and just think for yourself, what is more important? What fits to which graph pretty much? It's like the last graph really saying, okay, we can sometimes make really clear decisions. This can tell us the world. We can know something. Okay. Now we just know he has it or he doesn't. So doesn't so back in a minute guys okay i'll take the time to read through the chat so sick paint skills thank you how often and percentages do you actually make a black white decision in game versus the average player versus the average player is tough to describe because there is no average player right we always have reads if you would say the average player is tough to describe because there is no average player, right? We always have reads. If you would say the average player on a certain stake, on certain stakes, I could maybe give a better answer. But to make that clear with black-white decision, right now I'm just talking about bluff catchers. I gave you my river calling range structure. Snap calls, crying calls, bluff catchers, snap folds. So I'm not against average players. Let's use that term, even though it's not perfect. I'm not starting to fold crying calls or anything. I need a very, very, very clear read. But those 0 eb catchers that if he if he is like playing somewhat okay-ish they will be around zero ev and then i have them then probably some population tendencies around the spot are are enough to just fold all of those zero eb catchers right because then i'm like i'm probably over folding a bunch but i'm 100%. And I know like, okay, if that guy is bluffing, I have my hands that are calling and I find out. Or we can turn that around and say, okay, if the pool was bluffing in that spot, bluff heavy, I would have found out already because I played a gazillion million hands against those guys. So if I know they are not bluff, and this is now when i know i'm they are probably not bluff heavy there is like some yeah this is kind of a good reasoning okay so let's go most important first i hope i said so maybe we're we are reading some stuff here the wrong way around so in my opinion that was I want to say most important is first. So let's just go with looks good. I'm not really so a little EV to more EV. So, okay. Okay. Now it looks better first. Okay. So let's take the one from Maximilian Niedermeyer. He starts with blockers as the least which fits to the graph so that way it makes way more sense which is we talked about that already right blockers can only influence our decision a little but this is often what we look first at right everyone knows that i have blocker block his value i call right not even looking at the other side which is just that's not good right pretty much you look at blockers once you've went through all the others right it's like okay i have no sizing reach i he doesn't doesn't have a special pattern i don't know anything about his lines before and i have like population tendencies that they are playing that spot perfectly okay then you want to hit like okay frequencies with your zero And therefore you can use your blockers to say like, okay, that's one of the little better zero EV catchers or a little worse. Okay. Very, very small. The second one, and there's no clear answer, right? This is just my personal opinion, but actually let's start from the other side. For me, the very, very, very clearest one is just the sizing tail. And if you say the sizing pattern tail includes the river sizing, obviously that will always be more helpful because it's just more information. But I've seen it as a way that it's pretty much what happened before. For me, the clearest thing is the sizing tail on the river. I have notes on recreational players where I have pretty much like other stuff when it comes to reads. I have kind of a template that I write down there. And then it's like half pot equals bluff six times. Pot equals value four times. It's maybe not 100% black or white, but that is enough, right? And I would write that down every single time I see see a bet so actually like i i look at stuff when he played when i play like high stakes and play just a few tables i try to watch every bigger hand he plays versus like other opponents as well so this is something where against recreational players the 50 hotkey is like the favorite one for like it's like either weak value or bluffs for some players it's just bluffs where it's just this is something like that can be strong or the pot button is only value it can be something like that as well it's like okay the pot button is only value so i'm just always folding when i don't beat enough of his value range and then in between i gave the order, actually we can go to the next slide, that one, set sizing pattern tell. It's like the sizing is always something someone really chose. Like he looks when, especially like that's just, yeah, just choosing a line is full grace call, but the sizing is typing in something. It's like, did he bet 120, 105, 150? You can read more out of that. And especially that we'll come to the examples. And yeah, so therefore line tail is for me something, okay, we'll get to the examples. Let's get to the examples. I guess that's actually the next Kahoot. Let's try that. If it's not working and we need to skip something, that's just how it is. But let's try that this year. Scoreboard, great. Open ended question, try to come up with examples for a line tell. I just described to you what a line tell is. It's for example, that was my example. Don't use it, please. Someone was check raising value heavy and now I'm facing a river jam after getting check raised. That is a line tell. Like some other stuff, what could be a line tell? Just examples what you face on a day-to-day basis, pretty much, that you, after that lesson, try to implement in your river decisions when you make them a little more. Okay, Mantas writes, over bets and MTTs mostly value on lower stakes. Yes. And this is a very clear one. And this is a sizing tell, right? just talking about the river size wouldn't be wouldn't qualify as a line tell now we're really looking at something that happened before so calicio neto i guess this is can be a line tell actually like i'm just reading the chat on the side while you guys all answer in kahoot check check shove in certain situations i would say especially when support where you don't check too often let's say you check, check, check, shove in certain situations, I would say, especially when it's a board where you don't check too often. Let's say you check, check, check, shove as like the preflop aggressor on a board that you can see that 100%, like which block did you check on king, nine, deuce in the first place? So this is very, very dodgy if you then start doing something crazy later. So let's see, nine, 10 answers ten answers show answers i want to show answers bet check bet is value yeah yeah just i would say value heavy because again this is kind of a thing where actually it's like what you what you're mainly saying is villain did decide to not keep bluffing on the turn and this is very tough because lots of people have that thinking it's like i'm either bluffing or i'm giving up and from the giving up part there is no comeback this is something that has like people give up on the turn and then bluff the river is It's just not really happening. But you're always improving on the river with your range. Something makes a river set. Something makes a river two pair. Something makes a river top pair or second pair. So those value bets will always exist. But coming up with bluffs in those spots is sometimes tough because you need to bluff something that you decided to not bluff before. So I agree this is a this is a very, very value heavy line for recreational players. Bet, check, call, bet, river. Okay, bet, check, call, and then donk the river. Okay, this is just very, very special stuff is happening. Let's see, barreling small with draws on the turn and bombing a blank river. Okay, overbetting without many bluffs possible okay not understanding that villain has not a big reason to call but still just playing absolute hand strength yes absolutely i think this is this is the rather sizing pattern tell min bed min bed you're talking about the sizing as well so it doesn't qualify geometric is about the sizing as well a very good player's line doesn't make sense makes me think he hit some unlikely hand like okay that's more general i really try to think about like what exactly are we looking for right just splitting that up raising more awareness what happens someone is re-raising check jam always value yeah that's a line tell right it's like he's re-raising check jam, whatever that line is exactly. See that all street seems value heavy, deep stack, low stack. Okay, he's just triple barreling. Value heavy, can be a thing as well. So actually it's a little different than that what I was looking for, but okay. I'll skip that in mind. What were my examples here? Line tell number one one i call read on what happened on earlier street this was that one for example villain is three betting value heavy from the big blind actually therefore i prepared two sims to show that i hope that's big enough my screen fits pretty well just two of those i ran the same spot two times and the spot is big blind versus cutoff three bet pot we have let's look at the left side first king eight deuce rainbow we have this is a pio cash game three betting range with a mix of all kinds of stuff and this is what is it out of position 10 more And he can almost range bet. So we are calling all kinds of stuff when we have something in position. Turn, I want to take a Jack of hearts, say. Villain keeps betting big. And now let's have a look at the calling range. For example, where is it? This one here. Let's have a look at at let's take the jack of diamond jack of diamond we face that two-thirds pot bet or something let's have a look at those evs king 10 does not feel that great anymore right we have a top pair whatever let's keep an eye on that the one without the flush draw still has like 185 177 dollars ev in that 1000 dollars in the middle i think this is a little too small for you but should be fine right so it's like one of those clearly qualifies as a crying call it's like we have a top here it's okay whatever it's not one of those zero ev catchers right those mixes your pocket queens is something like yeah fuck it and you can see it like if if you want to discuss which suits to call or which not, feel free to do so. But you see, we're talking about a thousand dollar pot and the difference in calling, we are between minus 13 is the worst and plus 15 is the best. For me, it's enough to know queens as a mix, right? That like probably queen is that cooler. I like queen of diamonds is a little cooler. Queen of clubs is the worst because we don't block king, queen. Okay, whatever. Like that would be small stuff, but not that interesting for us now. Let's have a look at the right side. What I changed there was my read. We take a value-heavy three betting range. What I did here is, we can have that look as well here. This was the three betting range, just keep to memorize the picture for one second. And the new three bet range is this year. And this is 6.3%, which actually lots of my villains on like Zoom 500 or something are playing. So what I did was I just killed all hands that are less than 50% frequency. So again, putting some reasoning in where I say, it's very, very likely with all those mixes, right? I forgot the queen four suited 1% here to kill that. That's just not happening. Like when was the last time someone was three betting you with king 10 off big blind versus cutoff? It's low frequency. King jack off, it's low frequency and offsuit combos. King seven suited. When was the last time you faced that? Okay, usually you see some of that four, five, five, six suited. And I think that's now, yeah, just my experience, whatever. So this is a value heavy range, but it's not like I made something up. This is what I face every day. And now let's run the same board. Okay. Villain can actually see that range with given that strong range. Okay, I can start folding my pockets. Let's just compare that. We face the same thing. But one time, we actually adjusted to a tighter three bet range, which is obviously true. And this is not just telling you what the problem is just running those sims with perfect ranges etc okay i just adjusted a little and now talking about bluff catching jack of diamonds both times a villain is betting two-thirds and now actually king 10 against a tighter range the one without the flush draw is already one of the zero ev catchers well like this is the clearest thing for me a sizing tail okay something that is kind of a crying call before it's now shit because how can villain ever show up with enough bluffs when he just doesn't start with like shit in the first place right so that would be same thing he check raises the flop to value heavy how can he bluff the river in the end when the flush gets there let's say it's just not possible he's missing those hands so that as a little example and now coming to the second part of line tails that kind of you mentioned and i gave that one a name pretty much referring to a good old sherlock holmes story and this year's I call the dog that didn't bark maybe maybe you know that story that like Sherlock Holmes was just like solving one of those puzzles and it was like there was a crazy dog involved who barks all the time and the neighbors were awake and there was like a murder or something happening and everything they found out was like or Sherlock Holmes was the one to find out well why didn't they talk about the dog it's like this guy is always barking so much when something is happening and that night something happened but he didn't bark apparently because people would have noticed so it was clear that like it must have been like a friend or anything I don't know the like just google the story and this is what I mean with that, that we are little Sherlock Holmeses in this freaking bluff catching spot. So think about what did not happen on earlier streets as well. If you know, for example, that guy likes to size up when he has it on drawy flops. I have, for example, one thing that whenever people do something special, I write that down in my notes. Let's say single race pot preflop ass aggressor bets his ace king big on king jack five. This is a pretty strong read. That big bet, I don't see that too often. So when he's not doing that, what does that tell us? Well, he is lacking big, strong hands in his weaker in his smaller bet size so i can maybe end up calling lighter against that right or i can check race lighter like it's not sad that he never has it he's probably betting kings and jacks small so it's like yeah it's tough but still that something did not happen can give you a read when you you know someone sizes up, not talking about sizings as well, but still fits. It's like when someone sizes up when he has it on the river, but this time he uses his 75% hotkey, gives you more reason to end up calling with a bluff catcher instead of being clueless and just facing a 75% bet. So it's really small differences there. One small question is, what's the 2E sizing on turns in the tree building window? It just does automatically calculate the linear sizing towards all in. So if you put 2E in there and the perfect sizing to get all in is like that turn 71%, that river 70%, the solver does it for you. Okay, that was the first example. Now let's see's see i guess there should be the next question for you guys same thing try to come up with examples for sizing pattern tell we had already a few i mean it's kind of kind of obvious right just maybe something just tell us right this is sharing thoughts when it comes to that population tendencies you're here in such a great community you can talk to each other what are you guys playing like my biggest benefit was always to have players around me that play the same stuff right it's like gaining reads from them it's like hey fedor hey reiner hey whatever like how did that justin bonomo guy call i say it already how against you? Oh, he calls always. So I can guess he calls against me next time too, right? So probably better not bluff too much. Stuff like that. So make use of that. And this is why that is so important. It's just super obvious what I mean with sizing pattern tail now after talking about it all the time. But still share your thoughts. Where is it in the tournaments you are playing? What do see thinking about it okay ten answers again let's see race when flush gets there always value okay so no blocker bluffs on your stakes it seems like right for my stakes that would be something this is one of the spots that is actually like that i sometimes need to catch you this is my favorite one i want to talk about that later using the mouse we want up to squeeze that extra value yes it's like so insane right instead of betting 75 hotkey doing this this sound i hope you can hear it just like did people ever put extra half a big blind, one big blind, one and a half big blind in there to make you hold something? No, they expect you call the same range anyways, right? And they just squeeze out the little extra value. Medium flop, small turn, bomb river. Okay, small c-bets and super connected drawing boards. I'm not sure is that saying there's value or bluff heavy. I don know but it can mean something right that big one represent nothing there's something when there are lots of natural bluffs and people size up that's like one that i face a lot that is just very very value heavy because then oh it's lots of natural bluffs he could be bluffing and then call but when he uses like half pot or three quarters on that on that same structure board texture it's like always nothing half pot half pot 90 pot value yes 100 over bet value exclusively yeah on some stakes definitely right why not use the 75 hotkey block bet on river rarely a bluff well we'll talk about that right it like, how tough is it to bluff there, right? And how often do we need to be good? There's a psychological effect when it comes to bluff catching as well, because you get instant feedback. And there are different situations, right? Let's say we face a 150% pot bet. Well, we need to fold more than 50%. And when we call, well, we shouldn't be good to like all the time. So it's like we win one, we lose one. We get that instant feedback and it feels like, okay, right? So if we win, we feel great because we owned him. When we fold, when we call and we lose, we feel like, oh, we should have folded. But that's like, it's kind of evened out a little. But if we face a block bet on the river, say 25 we'll talk about that in a second we only need to be good like 16.6 percent of the time and that means that well pretty much five times you lose you see the value and all the time the sixth time you win but still you have that emotion in you that you lose you lose you lose you lose you lose you win well or you win one time and then lose five times and you feel like okay maybe next time better not call but this is just really evaluating the the situation how often do you freaking need to be good there right is it correct that well when you're calling block bet it's just correct that you lose always this is what i want to say villain tends to value bet very small river on scary boards afraid to lose value but also not happy when raised yes block bet for me is always out of position this year in position when people size down in position this is squeezing out the last value i feel like always because like this bet is like risking to get raised again like in spots especially when you are capped somewhat it's like the spot that people like bet only within value never with bluffs and then i mean there is no the people when we play different stakes but we just keep an eye try to evaluate it raise that awareness for what is happening like use the community and find the reads that are the right ones for you it's not like like one fits all concept. Okay. Three player multi-way pod with a short stack all in. No. Okay. Yes. Someone is all in. Yeah. And then we see over bets with the two players that are still involved. Yes. Sizing pattern tells for live games is tougher because there are no hotkeys. I'm a big friend of hotkey tells. There is like the rumors about using big chips or not. I never read something into it something into it it's like yeah maybe just like you need to find like what is different to the pattern he usually does if he usually uses all those chips and now does something different from that it means something and it's always sizing triggered by hand whatever but since people are not even calculating the pot correctly in live poker even in the highest stakes you cannot read too much into the sizing you have to read more in like some kind of betting patterns physical stuff whatever but i'm not the genius when it comes to that okay so let's see my sizing pattern tells what's just this year like the the steady upsizing like this is just very very very value heavy it heavy. He shows me he has a 65% hotkey, but then decides to go 85. Why doesn't he take like 65 again? It's like scrolling up the mouse wheel. Villain bets 50, then 40, and then like the last hope 30, there's like obviously thin value or just last hope here. Like if a recreational player, often they don't like giving up either. They are like different types, but it's just natural, like to go for those last hope bluffs. But then what they do is use the hotkey and size down or type in something small, maybe villain folds. It's not like thinking in hands and combinations and ranges. It's just one chance. Maybe he folds, right? Cheap chance. Maybe he folds. I call it the last hope bluff. last hope bluff and yeah this is something just like pattern it's different whether he goes like 30 30 30 and it's just his hotkey or he goes like he starts with something and then goes down can all that can mean something can mean different things but keep an eye on that okay let's see is there one more kahoot maybe for yes sizing tails i mean we had that all that let's still do that the last one what is a classic sizing tail you face i hope we have the time we make a little longer than it was planned but that's fine so clear sizing tails just talking about the river sizing now even if we talked about that guys four answers is not enough just type the same thing over and over again that's fine so we we all get a little more aware of what might be dangerous and find the the good fold next time or maybe we have a bluff heavy sizing tell as well and then we find the the hero call or even the crazy race with shit okay 13 answers let's go pot low stakes always pot or bigger value yes over bets value two-thirds value 80 to 90 bluff this is interesting right this is something that does not go hand in hand with a big is is like stronger right this is could be the the upside scrolling over bets are value they are not balancing it over bad value like always third pot from rec always value that's like for me the in position ones are really the strongest ones pot size bad value half pot often bluff 100 people want to bet they have two three hotkeys as options they are bluffing they take the smaller one odd numbers when usual sizes available two-thirds one half 100 okay over bet two times pot more value heavy okay so we all agree over bets are representing strong hands and mainly people do that when they have strong hands a buddy of mine just ran a what is kind of a population tendency report and they were just double checking a gazillion hands for is it on average good to call down with top here on the river like on zoom 500 or high stakes or i don't know and what's the clearest it's losing money of all times don't shove when draw gets there's value yes agree so all that stuff right this year the 80 90 is bluff i'm not sure all right depends a little i have seen one where it's like the the fake over bet i've seen as like a bluff fake over bet i mean like 100 to 110 we're like we make it look like an over bet but it's actually not one i've seen that bluff heavy from some but now i just want to give you like suggestions, right? What to look out for. And now therefore make better notes, make better reads, make better conclusions. Once it's like, not, I mean, it's not like we meet here and now everyone knows that when they bet this, it's a bluff or value, right? This is just too complicated. And people like, I mean, we're not just playing idiots. That's the unfortunate thing, but all right. There of stuff to be found out okay let's see what did i write down sizing tail clear fishy tendencies half pot weak pot strong hotkey problem villain always uses the 75 hotkey but now typed it in manually at the real difference knowing this guy uses hotkeys but typed in 125 manually you can see it that people use that manually or it's scrolling it's kind of the same thing which always says triggered by hand they do that because they think they want to do something special for their hand why didn't they take the 75 percent button or villain you always uses the hotkey but scrolled up kind of the we see often that is rounded to big blinds. All right, so just if any one of you is like already using some random programs to have like some bet size, et cetera, because this is, I guess, not in the software. I don't know. Make sure to not round to big blinds. Just a little advice, I would say. Okay, so we talked about sizing tell, sizing pattern tell, about line line tell and how like important they can be so so far right going back to this year it's just we know what can be how important so and this is the steps I want to think through I want to know in which spot I am then I want to know about villain do I have something clear if no okay what happened before if no okay what else happened before right do I know anything about that before okay if not fuck it right then I have to play real poker and then we get to think about blockers and stuff because we we cannot make insane ev when we are in bluff catch situations without reads? So we want to play our hands as good as possible and therefore pretty much call the little better ones and fold the little worse ones. And this is what we're getting to now, blockers. Just double checking the chat. Tanks a long time and then bets he thought about his river sizing which equals heavy value yes agree what about blockers this is just a problem that again i said that in the very beginning it's one of the biggest risks just doing what you want to do like emotionally and then find like justification right i want to call and then oh i have blocker like you can either unblock bluffs or you can block value or whatever. And just like whatever helps you with your justification of what you want to do is like the reasoning then we're like before think through the other stuff first right and then make like an an unbiased decision right so really remember our goal the only goal is to to find out whether villain could be bluff or value heavy. And blockers, therefore, are only interesting when they have influence on that ratio. And obviously, the tighter ranges are the more blockers matter. Therefore, when we have special cards in our hand kind of for that spot, we want to play big pots. This is why we like jam 10 times pot with random blockers on the river which we do in the same way with nuts or when we have like a bottom pier in a three bed pot that's often like one of the triple barrels because it's like blocking one of the sets while before still having like two parent trips equity stuff like that so the tighter the ranges the more blockers matter and focus on does it influence the ratio it's not we block value it's not a reasoning we block value and we unblock bluffs in a certain spot this is a reason that this is a better catcher or not right there's not just one side of the metal and now i make a little example and then we get to the last kahoot question and now this is like very very very important this is not talking about bet, right? This is exactly the example I just came up with before. Hero is facing a 25% block bet and we need to find a bluff 16.6% of the time, right? I did the math for you. To call profitably with a bluff catcher, I at least hope that the math is correct. So let's make that 16.6% just an even 17. And the correct bluff value ratio would be like 17 bluffs and 83 times value. So now check out the last question and give me your answer. I mean, they're actually just too honest. I hope you understood this thought. There are only two honest answers, but maybe you think about that because like all the students I had privately so far yeah never thought about that so the question is when facing a small bet on the river what is the most important thing to look at when we think about bluffs and value okay so majority got it right because well blocking value is always great but especially when villain is betting small it's the bluffs that influence the ratio way way way way way way way more so let's have a look at that just a little example i continue here it's the same text there and now we continue here small blocker influence let's say we block both of it just to have a look. Five value and five bluffs. Then it's like, oh, fuck, just that blocking bluffs leads to that problem. We have 12 bluffs now, 78 value in villain's range. So he is actually now super value heavy in the end. I mean, 13% when he should do 16, but because of blocker, it's. It's pretty clear if you look at the ratio 17 to 83, whether you influence those value hands and make it like 85 or make it 75, it's not a big deal at all. But whether it's 12, 17 or 25, this is the major issue. So whatever has less combos is the more interesting thing so when we think about catching it's mainly like one golden rule i'm having especially like three bad pots that fits pretty well whenever i make like a bluff catch there when it's tight ranges i want to have the image in my mind of the hand he's bluffing with if i cannot come up with a hand that i want to see on showdown then i shouldn't be calling probably i need to find like those bluffs i need those and if like because we're talking tight range if he ends up like just having 10 value combos i need to only find like three four or five bluffs if i find those i mean it's super likely that the call will be good in the end if i can't find any it will be Same thing works the other way around. Let's say when we are betting and we think, for example, about overbetting. It says villain folds most of the time against an overbet and only calls sometimes. So there, the less combinations is again, the more important thing, right? So I'm more thinking about, I want to block block villains calling range instead of unblocking his folding range it's like okay let's say on queen 10 something whatever king i want to make sure he cannot have ace jack like instead of i want to unblock his queen jack jack 10 10 9 whatever he might be check folding on the river all right it's like just that little pattern what how actually does the the ratio get influenced given certain circumstances just little math thing but once you get it it's just like keep your eyes open for when you're betting and this is why that question like block bet is always value first of all we have that emotional thing that it's right that it's always value and it should be always value, but always only means like 83% here. And so it's really risky to overfold that because then Willem prints with his loves and we need like for making exploitive faults there, even if it feels like they always have it, we need a good justification. Okay. I think, yeah, this is trying to wrap it up now. We talked about lots of stuff. Maybe one thing that was not in the slides so far is think about, again, my three questions of what would be right? What is Willem doing wrong? What is the right exploit? But you can think about it in the other way as well. It's like, okay, you know what you are theoretically doing wrong you are either overfolding or you are either or you are calling too often by making that decision and think about what would be the exploit against that so if it's just impossible to exploit you i mean why not doing that right this is especially meant to mean like in spots where you want to overfold think about okay how can villain make ev there let's say you are in a three-bet pot and just like you are the caller calling on the button versus a big blind three-bet villain starts starts off too tight and the board just smashes him so it's like and you think about calling down a catcher where it's like well how, how can he exploit that? He firstly needs to three bet trash. And then he needs to go crazy with that trash without having anything in, let's say, even a spot where you're protected somewhere. We're like, okay, it's not happening. So if he manages, it's like, for me, I see that, okay, I have EV here. I have EV to distribute. I have EV here in my hand. And I can either give it to villain's value bets that I know he he will find people see aces and they know how to three bet or i give it to his crazy bluffs we're like okay right if i'm playing against fit or holds maybe or matthias i don't want to give it to their crazy bluffs because they find them and it's like i rather want to force them i only give you the value when you when really have the hand. But against all like those average players, everyone knows how to play value hands. But coming up with the bluffs, it's like, I want to, I see it as a reward. Like, okay, you don't, your value doesn't get a shit. But when you have, when you make a crazy bluff against me, I want to reward you kind of, because I don't think you're doing it, right? So this is pretty much, again, kind of a logic behind that to really, yeah, attack that a little easier. Okay. So let's get to the last slide. Same thing. I talked about the same thing all the session, raise awareness for what your goal is. Our goal is to find out whether villain ised or value heavy. Nothing else in those spots, really nothing else. We are the ones exploiting. We are the ones making the money. It's not like, oh, sure, minimum defense frequency is something that tells us this is how it should be in theory. But once we think about, we try to find out what he is doing, not the other way around, right? It's like, okay, if I have no clue, I don't want to get bluffed. And I play like kind of pyro ranges and use my randomizer sure okay if like i'm playing line is love maybe i try to do that but then i'm playing the wrong game so the games we are playing we want to be the ones with the edge right so we are trying to like find out what villain is doing wrong and then have the right adjustment and And when I decide I want to be bluff heavy because I want to be over-folding because this guy always has it, then I, at the same time, do not have to think about, well, but then I'm exploitable. Well, no, like it's just the other way around. So yeah. And now I showed you that little graph with like those, in my opinion, influences on the EV. And this is, that should really help us with the structure of our thinking. This is what I meant here with putting structure into it. It's just like, start with the clear things. What can make yourself like, what can help you to make a great decision? A very clear read can help you. I would say sizing tails is just the clearest, but it depends on how we mean it, right? We discussed that here so clear tendencies lines pattern tells right people three betting like value heavy from the big blind especially for example because it's just natural to call your bluffs if in tournaments shorter i know the ranges are a little different but it's always like that that usually hands get three bet as bluffs that are natural calls. Ace-deuce, ace-three offsuit, bullshit like that. Well, often people will never forget to three bet aces. But people will call ace-deuce off before they think about three betting even. So this is where that value heaviness comes from. This is just like logic explanation, I would say. We're like, okay, how does that turn over to over to to post flop right check raising is just a tough thing to be doing right again check raising check raise bluffs are mainly hands that are natural check calls open enders gut shots mid pairs bottom pairs okay it's easy to end up value heavy so this is something to keep in mind for later states if everything busts and you were like check calling everything it's easy to end up value heavy. So this is something to keep in mind for later states. If everything busts and you were like check calling everything, it's just very, very, you have all the natural bluffs in the world. Well, it's just very, very easy to over bluff when nothing gets there. Keep that in mind. And then it's like, okay, how can villain exploit you by not bluffing? Again, that thought process. Okay, he's not bluffing, like on 8 7 deuce deuce 3 really tough right so if he does that okay i can like there i want to call too often actually or even raise more if he manages to not bluff all those hands then he earns the eb right so and really that emotional problem i mentioned a couple of times now really of like it's just so easy when you multi-table when you are like deep in a tournament you like you're not like there's always that point where you don't try to play your best anymore because you have a deep run and you just hope that it goes well somewhere and that is something that is just like bluff catching is just such an emotional thing does he have it or not i'm right or i or I'm wrong. Right. We're like, you don't see the whole ranges. You have no clue whether you were right or not. So really try to see the spot as an analytical as possible. And first think about all the information you have. And this is where I gave myself like a new rule. Take your time on the river, especially in those bluff catch spots, spots, think that through that through know the line know the sizings and then make your decision instead of ah fuck already on the turn thinking about i want to call him so badly and then finding any kind of reason i'm like as i said i think i'm like one very very very good at that like fine i have some kind of blocker or i unblock some kind of stuff or he would play something differently on the flop that is value so he has to be bluff heavy here now or just like when you look for reasons to just find the call you will find them if you look for reasons to just find the fold you will find them that's the problem and therefore like there's only it's really tough to stay unbiased and really think about all the information so So I hope, and this is to wrap it up here. This session helped you a little to put aware, to raise awareness for all the spots we can think about and to help yourself a little with structure. What is more or less important? All right. Lots of talking and my water's empty. So let's wrap it up here. See you guys anytime next time. Maybe let's see. We don't know. And yeah, it was great to have you here. And good luck making some hero folds and making the right hero calls the next session. Good luck with that. And keep posting the successes in the Celebration channel. Even if I'm not posting there, I'm sometimes watching and I'm just happy to see stuff. Yep. Cheers.
