### TOPIC: cash postflop calling 3bets
 Calling 3Bets with a plan. We'll talk about 3Bet pots today. We'll talk about, as always, quickly the spot. What am I talking about for all the beginners out there? What is a 3Bet pot? What does it mean that we call? And then I'll split things up into two areas, as I do usually. And it is reaction game and action game. So obviously reaction game is whenever a villain sets the parameters, which is the case when we are the callers in a three-bet pot. That means that villain is the aggressor and we have to stick to whatever he comes up with. But still, villain will check it sometimes and that will put us in action mode if we want to. So there are spots for action game. And this is just a little splitting up things to be prepared for everything that comes up, to have the awareness of the spot we are in, to have the nice little guidelines that we work with in each individual spot. All right. Then as always, it won't be that in that way, like the examples will be in between. There will be examples. We'll quickly talk about potential exploits, typical exploits that I'm using that I expect the field to be doing wrong. And also key takeaways to let you go and crush in the end. And yeah, as always, feel free to write anything in the chat, to ask any kind of questions. Feel free to interrupt me to just like ask me. This is for you right this is for you especially for the people that are in here for the coaching so the the players the the yeah player anything is fine miguel the players that are on the platform don't have that chance so i'm super happy about everyone who is in here already and yeah let's get started the spot very easy calling three bets actually i didn't want to make the title too long it is we are talking about in position so we are not talking about calling three bets out of position today this is another i leave that for maybe another add-on video or probably another coaching because this is a lot of a lot of things happening and a very different topic. It's too much to put that in one. So what happens is we do raise first in, and someone out of the blinds three bets us. For example, we are the hijack, we are the cutoff, we are the button, and then the small blind or the big blind three bets. And what happens next is that we decide against the fold, that we decide against the four bet. We do make the call and see a flop in position. So far, that is something that is covered well by videos on the platform. It is very, very easy to stick to certain kind of ranges. So really everyone who is motivated to get better in poker should easily find a way to play reasonable preflop ranges. And this is the point where I want to start today. so we are not discussing the edges or like the mixes of calling versus certain three bet sizings versus certain positions and so on this is something that you can do individually or just together as a group or just look up things so yeah let's see is it fair to say that when we are calling a three bet we are playing more to reduce our loss get back more than what we lost with the initial race if you want to double check hold a manager that's important for that if you think about your borderline calling hands that you only need to beat like minus 250 bb per 100 or minus 2.5 bb per hand which is your open raise. This is important, but whatever is in the past, as Miguel says here, whatever is in the past happened. We started at a new zero pretty much and we want to make plus CB decisions. It's in the end the same, whether your zero is the minus 2.5 you started with and you start to get higher than the minus 2.5. Well, that's as like saying we have new zero and you start to be plus a b so it's it's a it's a reframing when you do that whole dimension work and you double check how did you do with your pocket deuces to pocket sixes calling versus a three bet in your last 500 000 hands it's important that you are not losing money when it says you lose 200 bb per. Actually you're making one BB per hand, that being said, and that would be quite a decent win rate for those mixing hands, right? Or like now I was talking about a three BB open, which is probably not accurate, but yeah, kind of was stuck in my head. So this is just the only thing that you need to be aware of. Everything else is just like a definition thing and works out either way. All right, let's start with reaction game. All right. So just as things are, as the caller, we have the weaker range on pretty much any board. Yeah. Let's just like quickly for, we always have some beginners. I have some hands, not hands, some names I've never seen. Some of the recs out here. Can someone very, very quickly with like one or two sentences can explain us why we always have the weaker range on pretty much any board, just very quickly as the caller, why is that the case? Sometimes it makes sense to just, just repeat that. Here we go. Chevy half a sentence is correct, right? We do four-bet top range. Will and Dust have aces, kings, queens. Whatever the spot is, obviously, we can sometimes grab aces in certain scenarios and so on. But on average, we are four-betting our best hands. Those are the hands that are missing. While that, like some spots, does not necessarily mean we have the stronger range post flop, it almost always means that for three bad pots. Because assuming we play about 100 big blinds in our cash game scenario, aces, kings, queens, overpairs are almost always fine to stack off. just talking about flops right it may be if it's like 10 7 6 mono it's not okay to stack off pocket jacks that don't have like a spade that maybe that's the case but on average those hands are so freaking strong given that sbr right stack to pot ratio that they are just good enough to stack off so and this means the the person with the more top hands the more over peers is the stronger range overall which means this is the guy who should do the majority of the betting right which is like okay it's the stronger range and we as the caller have the weaker range and yeah that leads to point number two it is absolutely villain's job to build his betting strategy. Everything we can do is reacting. This is why we call it reaction game, right? We react to his sizings and we usually do so by almost exclusively calling. There is always, especially in GTO Wizard, a little raising range, but we are the one that has the weaker range. We want to keep that together some raises are fine some very specific hands but the majority of hands just want to do some calling and see more cards playing in position making use of our position right not raising too much raising kills our positional advantage and for that what we need is absolutely range awareness that we know our range that we know where we are at in our range that we know villain's range if possible and just as easy as it sounds odds and outs we need to react to villain sizing it's difference whether he bets 20 percent 33 50 75 or he just over jams the flop right right? And outs, right? Outs, not just knowing that having a flush draw means we have probably nine outs to hit a flush in the next card, and that this should be about 18%. That's not what I'm talking about. It's actually kind of not irrelevant. Like it's some knowledge that is quite easy to get, but that we understand which hands are good against villains value hands right how good is the bottom pair how good is a pocket pair how many outs do we have if we improve is if is that a good value bet do we improve often to a second best hand are we improving to a hand that is just like beating villains value gems? Stuff like that. Some qualitative ranking of hands and knowing what can happen next. That look into the future. All right. So let's see. I don't see it. Here we go. Does almost exclusively calling apply just for flop or all three streets in general? It mainly applies for the flop does mainly apply for the turn as well but there are some more exceptions yeah there is some more jamming on the turn because we can kill the action on the flop there's some raising in specific situations but only with certain hands it's like if we mainly will face small c-bets a lot in those spots where we should have a raising range and that means that we will defend like 70 percent of our range and maybe have a maximum of 10 percent raising range so really the main part is our calling hands all right shill 11 this is based on cash so 100 big blinds deep right or are we talking generically overall stack death this is 400 big blinds so when i talk about flop turn river positional advantage and so on this is definitely 400 big blinds if we talk about way shorter mpt scenarios there's way more aggressiveness way more equity denial that we can jam flops that we raise certain hands stack off way lighter that it is not necessarily the overpairs, and so on. So again, all the examples will be 100 bigs, but some logics will be possible to apply for other spots as well. What about slow playing preflop calling kings and aces versus tight three bettors? Doesn't make any sense because tight three bettors means that, well, they have it, and then we want to stack them. Against loose three bettors, it would make a lot of sense to trap something like that. Usually aces are a solid trap in some spots when we have low SBR because then villain can have three bets like king, queen offsuit. We want him to hit a king or a queen or just blast. And we are pretty much invulnerable, right? It's tough to make two pair and to beat aces you need to have two pair or better so that makes sense since villains three betting range especially when they are tight contain lots of ace acts kings are not great to to slow play pretty much ever like you see that especially against four bets kings are always just jamming because folding out an ace is like folding out 30% equity, which is a big success also. So kings are only a call, and I don't want to necessarily call that a slow play. For example, under the gun versus the big blind, when kings are already close to being a four bet, like a good value four bet call. When ace king is not just going in the middle all the time and so on. And pocket queens are not jamming. So then they are more just a call, but not because it's a great slow play. I like trapping ace king suited more as we keep dominating ace x in. You should do that with ace king offsuit. Ace king suited is just another 5% equity stronger to build a pot against anything. So trapping ace-king off, or I don't like the word trap for ace-king off, but to call that and especially like keep all that king-queen off, ace-10, ace-jack off, that would fall to a four-bet in, that works absolutely fine. And we can even see it in GTO wizard that let's say cutoff versus small blind. I think ace- fast plays like 25 of the time something like that depends on whether you build jamming range or a normal four bad range only this is some different pre-flop scenarios pre-flop ranges that shouldn't be the topic today anything is fine there and doesn't make a big difference all right so that being said so far we understand what reaction game means right villain is setting the parameters villain is telling us the style he wants to play is he betting big is he betting small probably that tells us that he is betting high or low frequency as well what he is representing and we are reacting and i think yeah i wrote down some decision points that if we are stuck in that position, then I have certain things that I personally think about to have like better awareness in every single spot, right? And my main flop thought process is just about not thinking about my hand, but like, yeah, am I raising the flop overall? Yes or no. If no is the answer that I use personally very, very often to simplify, then I know exactly my range for the turn and can go from there. Just means I let villain realize all his equity, which obviously has a downside, but it makes it very, very easy for me. And then call is the only option. The only decision, like after making that decision that I might play without a raising range, then is that I have one border, which is to call fold decision. And this is usually not a tough one. Some hands are like about zero EV or mixed or whatever. And maybe I can find some exploitative reasons to go either way. And if not, it actually doesn't matter too much what we do with those hands. And yeah, that's about it for the flop. And then we call or we fold. On the turn, it gets a little more dicey. Usually the turn is where people start to size up. Sometimes that happens on the flop already, like especially lower boards where people put out big bets to pressure you. This is the moment where I'm actually talking about bluff catching. And this is now where we need to understand equity. Equity against villain's betting range, against both his bluffs and his value. One very, very clear example is that people overvalue showdown value. Let's say 10-5 deuce, villain bets big. Whatever the spot exactly is. Something like pocket 7s and pocket 8s is absolutely irrelevant now. It's how you call it, indifferent now. It's a pure bluff catcher with two odds to improve. And people rank that sometimes higher than something like 5-6 suited. Like 10-5-2s, obviously pocket 8s are stronger than a 5. This is what I mean with orientation through showdown value. But obviously, if we talk about villain's value range, it is over pairs. And 5-6 obviously has not only two outs, but five outs against that. Very deceptive outs even. Like, who thinks that on 10-5-2s, the six is a big game changer? Right? I mean, obviously, two pairs get there, but it seems like a random card. So something like that is very, very important, where that sometimes even villain is either going all the way with his value, or if he checks, he's mainly on a give up. After betting big, big means polarized, which means he has value or bullshit. And if he checks at some point, it's usually not the trap, maybe some blocker issue where he traps like some sets. This is why he checks, but mainly it's just folding after checking. And that would mean that actually our showdown value does not really matter. And it's more about, do we beat at some point his value range? Or is he checking at some point and then we just win the pot by betting. So often sometimes like just a nut gut shot even though it might be six or five high is the better call against something right because you have those four nut outs against anything while if he checks you still win not by checking back but by betting so something like that is understanding that equity is what I mean here. This is my turn focus or not necessarily the turn, but the moment villain polarizes, the moment villain decides to put out big bets, telling us he has something good. All right. The river, things turn around a little and we should think about a little about blockers, right? Which hands are good, which hands are bad. And yeah, often this is like a little, lots of indifferent hands, but still understanding that one thing that I use a lot and that helped me to not call off too often is just try to think of villain's bluffs. If you can't find them, well, then there won't be many. And if you perfectly know, okay, like blush for it and he will blast all his ace queen and ace jack offsuit in this spot well then it's like not having maybe the flush ace might actually have a positive effect instead of a negative for you so i have a negative instead of a positive stuff like that so that on the river it's just like every bluff catcher can be decent and we look more at little blockers in in that sense then okay but now you see it's very tough to talk about the reaction game because we are not setting anything like we are just reacting and we need to work with what villain gives us and therefore obviously we'll have an example but this is the spot that i don't want to put too much focus on because we are not having many decisions. We have like call villain's bet size or fold, maybe some raising as well. And way more decisions that we have is once he checks to us, then we can do we bet or not? Do we bet small? Do we bet big? Do we bet again? And so on. This is where all the decisions are, and this is what we will focus on in probably five minutes as well. Okay. So I think I've just one example for the reaction game, because it's pretty clear, right? We can just look things up and yeah, make some game, if you make some maybe over-folding exploitative moves and that's it. Yeah. Triple barrels, I guess, under bluff low stakes. I can tell you that triple barrels are under bluffed in high stakes. So you can guess that people in lower stakes find less bluffs. That's absolutely true. Okay. Example number one. What if they bet polar on flop but then the turn changes their hand value a lot? 10-5-2 bet 67 call turn is an ace that also gives a flush draw. Well, then it's the question, do they keep betting do they bet small we need to react to a small size do they bet big they need to react to then we need to react to a big size but obviously our plan if we say like we call something on the flop just with a plan to take it away later it changes then on the turn maybe he does not even have pure give-ups right maybe some like jack nine's backdoor but not really right he has kings queens jacks that's what he wrapped on the flop turn ace makes it a medium strong hand so we need to attack that with like probably biggish sizings but yeah this is now very very specific i try to stay as general as possible because it's it's a big spot all the three bad pots we can't put them all together. But yeah, in general, as long as Willem is betting, we are a reaction game. We need to react to understanding odds and outs. We need to make lots of losing calls against small sizes. That's just how it works. We don't need to win often. And yeah. Now here, I want to go through the decision points once, at least in that example. Again, double check the decision points that I wrote down. There are a couple more maybe. But this flop, I want to talk about raising range yes or no. And then we obviously have that question, which hands are we calling, which are we folding? On the turn, we'll talk about the ranking of our bluff catchers. And on the river, again, a ranking of our bluff catchers. But now we are not talking about about equity there is no equity anymore on the river but we talk about blockers and now i i prepared one example where maybe it's a little interesting what happens from street to street so here very easy example one small band versus spot in a three bad pot king six deuce rainbow and villain decides to bet third pot if you put that in g GTO Wizard, there's some 20%ing, some third pot, maybe some half pot as well. I think third pot was the highest frequency bet size and this is our reaction. Bottom right, you can see the reaction. You see that is what I mean here. What I wrote down here is flop, no raising range necessary. And maybe to answer that question before in the chat, you see that aces can trap sometimes and kings like never ever never ever never because kings just suck when trapping okay and what if okay so everything we do like there yeah you could ask for like is there a single hand that absolutely wants to do raising aces not necessary we see like 20 king queen like maybe 30 like some of the suited king and everything else is a bluff addition like a six five like a four or five like pocket threes no all samey with calling so this is what i mean here with we need it. We can easily, easily simplify that towards just calling about like 75, 77%. And that's, that's a good strategy. And the only thing is, well, the point where what's the, the strongest hand we are folding. So like we see ace queen is a call, ace jack is a fold. Okay. But like ace queen makes one big blind. I think it's too small for you guys now, but this is why I'm just saying that. And ace jack is a fold okay but it like ace queen makes one big blind i think it's too small for you guys now but this is why i'm just saying that and ace jack is like yeah it's still called sometimes so it will be exactly zero ev the ace 10 ace 9 will be depending on the back door flush draws as are the ace 5 ace 4 suited it's a cheap price we see a turn let's see what villain does we still have positional advantage and everything else everything we are folding like like jack nine ten nine ten eight nine eight that obviously didn't didn't connect with that board at all and maybe some pocket sevens so very easy that flop on a board like that right very very tough to make a mistake here we see what comes next we sit there in position let's say i really have that image like we lean back here let's let villain do the we stay in here when we connect have a cheap price we'll see what's going on and then so we will play a turn and i'll come back to that point if you have flop questions there i see some guys are typing don't worry about that we we have time for for that example and now this is the moment that typically people polarize we get that queen of hearts on the turn so we have a flusher out there now we have uh straight draws going on gut shots all the peers are kind of shit and yeah villain decides to bet 50 70 to 75 it's a mix here in that spot i think actually the the linear sizing would be something like 63 or something something like that. So if you want to take one, maybe that's your sizing in that sizing plan of GTO Wizard. And now it's important to understand the ranking of our bluff catchers. I named it. So here, what I made is a list from best bluff catcher to worst bluff catcher. And yeah, I think everything like the weak king for me starts being a bluff catcher because villain is not really double barreling big with something like ace queen. So this is the point where we only beat bluffs. Obviously a king is great because it blocks the main value that villain might have, right? If we have a king, he has less ace king, less king queen and so on. So obviously there's no chance we fold a king and a king has very very very very decent ev here then the next one next best bluff catcher is a queen and a queen has very very solid equity against any bluff because villain needs to hit a straight or an ace and if villain has something like jack 10 hitting a jack or a 10 doesn't beat us if villain has something like seven eight of hearts a't beat us. If a villain has something like ace, 5, well, it's just the ace that beats us if he gets there. So queen is pretty strong. A 6-axe is actually the next best bluff catcher. And this is important once we talk about equity here. Obviously something like jacks, 10s, 9s is better than a 6. We can see it here, like something like pocket jacks have an EV of 0.05. Something like 7-6 suited and this doesn't contain any flush draws has an EV of 3.47. The reason is just the outs that we are having. Five outs, that is 10% of the time, we're improving to two pair or trips, which means we beat aces, we beat ace king, and well, the trips beat king queen, but that's about it. So yeah, this is just a, we beat a large chunk of villain's value range. So 10% equity to beat that is just way better than 4% equity to hit that. I'm not even talking about jacks and tens that villain makes straights when we hit sets and so on. So this is the ranking very very important now sevens and eights well are also shit even worse maybe blocker wise they are more interesting but they are obviously worse than jacks or tens because well if villain has jack 10 even a jack or a 10 is enough to beat those sevens and eights it's just way more over cards it. So it's very tough to bring those 8s and 7s to showdown and end up winning. All right. So let me double check the questions here. What if we no-clog range bet for villain? How much more raising do we make? Almost nothing. Like he almost has a range bet. If he bets his shittiest hands, there's still no reason to raise that. Like he add more of his 10-9 of clubs that he should then, that is probably mainly a check fold. But against those hands, we don't need raising. Raising is always a thing when a villain does have equity. We don't want him to realize that equity. So raising happens when a villain has high frequency straight draws, stuff like that. So King-6-deuce, you you will almost see no raising on something like king 10 deuce you will see raising maybe even more in king 10 7 then you have hands that is worth to charge right if not just waiting this this picture again leaning back in position is always better for you as the in position player now let's's just quickly, because it's a great question and I don't have that on the slides really, where like I just do not talk too much about the raising range because it's not that relevant for the overall understanding. Small blind versus button, recall, let's have a look at a board where there is not much equity going on like the King King 6-2. We can quickly see that this is almost a range bet. And with almost, we see like, right, if you note lock it, he's forced to bet 10-8 of clubs. That won't change anything. So we can bet like this is the third pot here. This is exactly the one I showed you, right? This King-Queen is just raising to fold out all the ace acts while chart like stacking off against anything else this is why ace king is not raising now we change one card this year to a 10 and oh we see even less raising okay but deuces are because we don't have deuces right i make it a six and then we'll see some raising or a five i don't want to add extra gut shots and we see that pocket five start raising all the time because pocket fives don't want to see an ace not a queen not a jack not a nine right on king six do the sets they want to get more cards flying in here give villain a little something right it's like here this is the reason or maybe i mean king jack or like something like jack 10 with a flush draw yeah now we see okay it's a different different game tree regarding villains bet sizing this is why things are changing but he uses more bigger sizes as well let's make it king 10 with a flush draw just think about not raising pocket fives now you just hate like this is you're really losing money here by not raising not much it's still okay to simplify but yeah lots of cards just maybe a little little interesting thing is like tens like calling because they are still an upside right villain does have nine eight seven sixes the the set under set option is great for tens not for fives this is why this is a slight difference but as a general rule if villain's offsuit part does not have any draws you don't need raising that's a very very simple golden rule to have let's have look like that maybe what is that ace like very easy one ace six five villains offsuit part doesn't have any draws going. Well, he's anyways, not here, small bet. And we don't need raising like 6-5 to get it in and so on. Exactly. So M-I-M-L, Raka, it's just always, what are the good things happening and the bad things happening, right? So 6-5 is so natural to raise. Every amateur raises the flop two pair here. But why? Let villain suffer with his freaking, what does he have? King, queen? Let him hit a king, a king, jack, and so on. If against ace, queen, the money goes to the middle, no matter if there is the queen before you raise or after you raise. So the equities stay the same. Obviously things change if the turn is like a bets, you call, turn is the freaking jack of spades. He adds lots of draws, get this freaking face out of the way. He bets, which sizing does he go for? He bets big now, sit there, six, five, no spades, wants to just freaking jam. Sorry, you don't see that really, but yeah, right now it's like no question anymore, right? Ace, jack, actually it it's not a jam it's a race, but yeah, stuff like that. So it's really that equity against us. So when there is no equity for villain, then there is not really raising necessary. Okay. I hope that is clear. And now that ranking here, understanding just the quality of love catchers regarding equity. I especially talking showdown value hands here something like ace queen here has still 10 big blinds 9.5 big blinds in eb okay cool let's go to a river then any wishes for a river card wet one here we go right i didn't go that wet but I had the flush going there to talk about blockers. So now I got more specific. You can see that in that list already. And what happens is Smallbine bets third pot club. Obviously, he bets 50% on the turn and he jams the river. And we need to now understand whether we have, we call super light pocket eights on the turn or pocket jacks on the turn or ace queen with or without a heart a king with or without a heart we need now to make a bluff catch or not and we need to evaluate how good our hand is we beat we beat bluffs we lose to value this is what it is yeah nice very good answer by omg kai hudichu to help horsepower here yeah and yeah now we want to take a look and this is now coming back to what i said before in general is you should know when you make a bluff catch which hand you hope for villain to have if you don't have any idea which hands he could have well then you probably are making a very bad bluff cash so i want you now to write in the chat the hands you want villain to have to see him triple off here that makes sense obviously that he does high frequency right it's like i don't want to see like i don't know pocket sevens here because i don't believe in them Something he does high frequency and gets there to the river with and decides to barrel off. Jack ten offsuit. I hope for him he doesn't three bet. Okay. I had thought ace of hearts hands would be a bad bluff catcher in general because a lot of their bluffs would have ace of hearts offsuit second card. So interesting to see ace, axe, king of hearts in there at the top. Ace of hearts, jack, ace of hearts, ten, ace of hearts. So everyone gets the right ones, right? I'm sorry. off-suit second card. So interesting to see ace-axe king of hearts in there at the top. Ace of hearts jack, ace of hearts ten, ace of hearts... So everyone gets the right ones, right? So ace-jack, ace-ten with the ace of hearts or at least the jack of hearts or ten of hearts are obviously the highest frequency bluffs in villain spots. So everyone that we think can find those bluffs, we need to do some bluff catching against. And this tells us the whole list here list here. Ace-X king of hearts and this is Emil Raka gives us the perfect explanation here is actually the better catcher than ace of hearts king. People think with like about blocking the nut flush but you are also blocking the nut bluffs right so like something with the ace of hearts is not necessarily bad but it's kind of irrelevant right. The king of hearts is a beautiful one with the ace of hearts is not necessarily bad, but it's kind of irrelevant, right? The king of hearts is a beautiful one with the king of hearts. You're only blocking value hands. No chance you block a bluff with the king of hearts. So ace X king of hearts is the best one. Why here the ace of hearts is slightly positive as well is because a pocket aces with the ace of hearts are a value gem. And this is, this is an additional block you're having with that one. while aces without the ace of hearts, a value gem and this is this is an additional block you're having with that one while aces without the ace of hearts i think are not even a value gem or very very close so yeah ace king gets jammed itself this is why all the ace kings are very very very clear calls like ace king especially having one heart is just a very clear jam so this is why all the ace kings are calling and are better bluff catchers if we just look at the numbers. But actually then the next best bluff catcher is freaking pocket nines with a heart. Right? Like now in the overall picture you don't see it, but pocket nines with a heart are a bluff catcher that makes like 2.4 big blinds or so. And yeah, actually let me me see. Is that the, oh, this is, I didn't update that. This is not the right picture here, right? Obviously you still see that we could go all in, call, fold. This is still the picture from the turn. I didn't update that. I didn't want to show it. So we'll just do it here. Sorry for that. But small n versus button. What was the board? King, six deuce. King of spades, six of hearts, deuce of diamonds. Yeah, deuce of diamonds, queen of hearts. Bet third call. Bet half call. River was the three of hearts. I'll just kill myself for a second here. villain gems, 70% pot. What we see here is all the ace kings are calling. We see the ace of the the one with the king of hearts has actually an EV of 17 big blinds. The one with the ace of hearts has only nine big blinds and the one without has like five six big blinds. So this is now the difference just because of the blocker. That's very, very interesting. Then we see something like pocket nines with a heart, winning almost 2.5, almost three big blinds with the right suits, while something like a king 10 is indifferent. Okay, now Emil Raka, I'm definitely curious why pocket nines is a better bluff catch than pocket nines. And similarly, king nine versus king jack, king 10. Is it because their three bad bluffs have a lot of nine x like king nine queen nine no just look right above in the chat what's written down there you have your answer in the five comments above your post we want like within pocket nines and the nine of hearts we block value hands. 10-9 of of hearts, ace 9 of hearts, and so on. But we unblock ace jack, ace 10. So here, let's have a look again. Always frequencies are made by offsuit hands. This is villain's bluffs. This is villain's bluffs. There is no ace 9 offsuit. So having a 9 doesn't kill any bluffs, but it kills jack-nine of hearts, ten-nine of hearts, maybe even nine-eight of hearts, even though it plays differently here in theory. King-nine of hearts, ace-nine of hearts should check here as well. Like not necessarily that, like people are maybe not doing that. So this is that, right? And this is also why pocket eights are better and then tens are slightly better somehow and then it's the king x and then in the end we like jacks are really bad actually and the ace queen is like very whatever right actually here i did see it's like they are the same but like the ace queen with the ace of hearts is not necessarily better than the ace queen without. So it's slight, slight, slight differences. But looking at the absolute numbers here is really, really interesting. Let's have a look at the call again. The pocket 9s almost making three big blinds. Pocket 8s, zero. Pocket 10s, zero. Pocket jacks. Even with a jack of hearts, like losing three to five big blinds. Like really really horrible and then like kingdom indifference so it's like saying that all the hands are indifferent when villain bets like that all the bluff catchers are indifferent it's just not wrong it's just wrong so it's important to find the ones that make sense where it's just impossible for villain to have a bluff with that pop nines okay we't call them the turn that often. But still, we can understand that on the river, I think. All right. So this is a beautiful example for reaction game. Understanding the turn, understanding the river, and so on. All right. And yeah, I would leave it like that. Just training, training, training, training. GTO wizard drills here, calling down those spots spots so yeah you you will see in the you will see that in the add-on that will be posted soon actually i was lucky enough to get a good run and have like i think i played 20 21 hands without a single mistake in like obviously there's action game as well but it's a spot that is quite easy. It was my first, I was playing to let some ideas flowing. That was the first one. I still messed up there sometimes. Then I was in the flow and then I recorded one. And yeah, so this is, yeah, pretty nice. And this is actually something I want to say is not that I use 10 years of experience. I just use simple rules and you can do that as well. Okay, let's switch over to action game. Already 45 minutes gone, but I like to dig deeper in those examples. I love the questions. This is what the coaching is about. And if I need to kill some of the examples of the action game, it doesn't hurt me really. So yeah, action game. Since we explained the reaction game already, action game is just the opposite. It's every time villain is not really going for his betting right he checks to us this has mainly two reasons a the board smashes us sometimes this can be the case especially when we are deeper maybe as well and then we should target all that shit with small bets but then villain has pure give ups because we have the stronger the stronger range all of a sudden or the stronger nut part and so on option b is that villain it is his board but still he decides to check and not range bet or anything then his range is usually centered around medium strong value that he decides to he doesn't need to deny equity but, but he can check like, for example, ace king four, he can check his king queen, a weak ace, something like that. This is something we want to target with big bets to put pressure on those go all the way or do nothing. This is what it's about here. These are the two options. We need to figure them out. And obviously there's lots of mixed spots in between where everything is possible but understanding these are the two main reasons we are looking for to find bet sizings and betting frequencies is very important and just tells you in most spots what the right thing should be all right what are the decision points in the action game on the flop and on the turn this made on purpose, I wrote down the same thing. What are we attacking? Once you know that, you know exactly what you should do. Let's make an example. I'll stick to small blind versus button. A villain small blind, you call on the button, villain checks to you on ace king for rainbow. are you attacking when you're betting just write down some hands villain checks on ace king for rainbow and he decides against the range bet that he could go with a tiny sizing what are you attacking if you're betting gut shots backdoor flush draw name hands name hands down the combos. Tens and jacks. Queens, all right, those ones, right? Queens, jacks. You see? Like we always get the same answers. You're very different people, probably sitting on other continents right now. And we get the same answers. And then you can ask yourself, what is the hand that is most likely that villain has it when he checks the board like that. All over the world it will be the same hands. So actually this is a great spot for exploits because they are usually not mixing that much, not protecting that much and so on. They have what their first instinct where it says check. Lots of people have pocket queens when they check on ace king four a weak king and so on so i remember a seal i think i told that story a couple of times where that happened while peter was walking by in like 2014 he's like how you're not freaking triple barreling here and i was like like every hand or what yeah sure every hand they call or they call fold or they call call fold's like, which back then was just absolutely right. It didn't fit into my logical thinking of poker because I assume people build a range. But no, they had certain hands. This is something we can make use of, right? Just like you can close your eyes and triple barrel and I can tell you, you are making a hell lot of profit. Probably you hate it because once in a while you run into aces but still on average you should make a lot of profit because they always have a king or queens and jacks and they're never calling it down obviously all right so you know what you're attacking other thing board is four five six what are you attacking four five six rainbow here we go shredder got it right it right. It's not ace-king. It's not ace-queen. It's not the backdoor flush draw. It's the freaking all the overcards to 3-bet. You have pocket 8s. You want him to fold his jack-10-0. Very important. His jack-10-0 has 25% against high frequency of cards you are having. So it's really anything that would freaking snap fold to a nothing. So knowing that can tell you okay you don't need a big sizing here which sizing do you need that he folds jack 10 on four five six maybe we want him to fold king jack also right so here i wrote it down as a general rule that works every time we do bet size exactly i think i wrote that down like 10 times already in the coachings. Focus on targeting the weakest hand category villain has that has relevant equity against our value hands. Jack 10 on 4, 5, 6 has relevant equity against a big chunk of our value hands. Absolutely. And this is why it's important. Well, maybe Queens and Jacks on ace, king, X, not that much. But it's like we're building a more polarized range. It's kind of a different style there. But it's important that you didn't tell me that you're attacking 9-8 suited give up on ace-king-4. ML Rekha, think again about it. We want to fold out jack-10 and queen-jack on 4-5-6. What is your sizing? If you're German, you're freaking schießt're german you're freaking cheese with cannon if you're not german i'm sorry i can't translate so we decrease to 20 to 25 yeah all right we could go even smaller right i can tell you already gto wizard is using 20 the higher we go the bigger the chunk is that we attack of like ace kings ace queens as well well. Obviously, it's like linearly going up how much better those hands are, how much we are trying to fold out. But if we really go with that rule, we want to only attack the weakest part there. This already makes a lot of sense. Okay, let's get two examples, right? This is just all we need to know. And this works for the turn as well. Once we're just putting the first bet in. It's like the first bet against a check is usually where villain has give ups, some of them have equity, we try to attack that. If there are no equity hands that are quickly giving up, we start polarizing, have our value hands and add bluffs and can be value or bluff. This is when we use big sizings. All right. Example one, very close to the, just say like six, five, four, this one, seven, six, five. Small blind checks to us on the button. We attack, I said it here, non backdoor flush draw broadways. You see how much the 20% sizing is preferred on the right side. Now this this is the correct showing here. And we see like 9s, 8s, obviously the sets, 10s, jacks, ace, jack, queen, 10, jack, 10, like very high frequency. We bet an ace, 5. We bet an ace. That's like, let's go. And on the bottom left, I show two villains folding range. Very important here. Again, we focus on the offsuit part. So this is why I said non-backdoor flush draw broadways. All the offsuit hands don't have a backdoor flush draw. How high do we need to attack? It's, as I said, like linear or a kind of fluent line. Like ace-10 should sometimes still call ace-jack. We don't even know how people react. Some people already fold ace-queen sometimes to that. Some probably not ace-king. So it's like there is no right, no wrong. You can go a little higher and maybe gain some more folds. You can go a little smaller and probably get some less folds. But the focus is on small. Get out those offsuit hands. Focus on offsuit hands. Once you play earlier positions, then something like king- king queen doesn't exist anymore at some point and you're just playing against a queen is king which it's interesting as well because then a turn jack 10 and so on tells you something and yeah or you it's more face up what people are having so here the 20 to get all those snap falls is very beautiful. Can we min-raise on these boards for someone who range bets to get in a similar spot? Absolutely. Yes. If you range bets, it's like way too much. And then a min-raise makes sense because he has that, we deny equity. Absolutely. That can make sense. And we have an advantage. We're just telling him, in a way, sir, we have have an advantage but we could also call and just like outplay him even more i will get to another gold rule that i'll just show that here i can tell you the the little rule already that helps a lot as if a villain should on that board use a big size okay he, he should range check here. So maybe let's freaking change it slightly. I was looking for a non flush draw, non straight on the board, like this. Like 10% polarizing here. It's more like 10 jacks getting in a little or we can change it to something like even more clear, it's more of the big betting happening right like 20% of the big he should polarize and not give us that that lean back advantage of seeing more cards while we can react on a dynamic board so yeah he's making a big mistake with only small betting already and he's investing way too much money with something like king queen king jack so you can kill him on the streets or you can kill him right now but then again min race is the perfect answer because here's the reason why you're betting small if he bets everything and you know he's betting king jack here well that has equity against your pocket eights and you kill it with the min race sure right perfect right and the gold golden rule I want to come up with is actually your sizing should always be the opposite sizing of the one that villain uses the most. So if villain should use lots of big sizing on 7-6-2s, you should use a small sizing. So if villain uses lots of small sizing on like a range bet board, you're probably well there's no check happening so this kind of sucks right this kind of sucks then you are probably using a big sizing so this is just something to keep in mind usually one guy wants to have the one sizing the other guy wants to have that sizing if you don't know your size you can think about whether you know villain sizing you should take if If they range bet smallness, Solver will raise range. Alright, Kai who do you rent more sims on that? I'm 100% sure than I did ever, so that's beautiful. Exactly. Alright, cool. Let's get another board out. Small blind checks to us on the button, on ace king five with a flush drop. And now we can see again what our reaction is. On the right side right side this is what we should do this is pretty much the board i asked you for already and we are absolutely ask ourselves what are we attacking and here again we are not attacking villains 10-8 of clubs we don't care about 10-8 of clubs it doesn't have any value in that spot so we attack medium strong value and therefore we need a medium sizing directional in that's like 33 is actually enough to go directional in but like 12.5 is what we slightly prefer with most of our ace kings ace queens maybe even ace jack we just don't have too many value hands pocket fives so yeah and then we see on the bottom left again this is villains folding or continuing range the blue side exactly what you said before he hates his life already with king jack pocket queens pocket jacks pocket tents they will navigate a little around hearts we fold out something like pocket eights pocket sevens right so yeah this is a good thing this is why we should bluff a lot with like five six four five type of fans pocket 3s, stuff like that. And yeah, it's a little relative what is a big size or a small size in three-bet pots. But here you see Willem can do lots of small betting. This is why we are more on the big betting side. Oh, here we see some 75% betting even. All right. So here the weakest part that has equity against us is something like queens, jacks, tens, nines, eights, sevens, and so on. Okay, quick example. I'll keep going. I'll answer the questions if they come up or if you're already typing. Example number three, let's talk about a turn. So let's say under the gun versus big blind, villain c-bats on king, queen, deuce. This time it's big blind versus early position. So this is very, very tight and different ranges. He checks to us on the turn. And here it's important to not use any small sizings, right? So here, what is villain doing here? Like he either has give up that does not have relevant equity. What can villain have that he's giving up here with? Ace-eight of spades? Of clubs? Six-seven of diamonds? Like yeah, we don't need to attack them. So what else might he have? He's coming from the big blind, so he doesn't have tens, nines, eights and so on. So actually what we are doing here is targeting queen-x right away. And we don't care about that shit. I didn't put in the folding range here so it's really ace queen and queen jack they were all pretty much indifferent or the big blind specials like a queen four suited that they should have okay let's get back to other questions okay not even yeah kaiuri is still explaining the the spot they are on boards where people are betting too often in spots where we have an advantage this is like bring the money put it in in my hands here and we need to just pick it up put it put it in the pocket like anything anything you do is is good there he will just suffer later on later streets there okay so here very easy understanding what are we attacking it's not like yeah he's giving up and then he's folding so we bet small no it's like it doesn't help you to fold out seven six of diamonds it's like no it's like here's a spot high cards are out there there's no equity denial so we are using big and polarized sizings direction all in another one opposite example here a big blind should bet big on that flop he does so 75 even%, even again, big blind versus under the gun. And then on like a very, very good card for imposition, the big blind checks to us on the turn. Now villains give ups like ace king or like a king jack of clubs, something like that. They absolutely have relevant equity. We might have any kind of pocket pair. We might have whatever flush draw, and we can actually attack them with a tiny sizing. So when you see again, bottom right, we bet small with a very high frequency with all those hands. Exactly. Opposite sizing, right? If villain keeps betting on a seven, like let's say he has pocket Kings, he could keep going. He would freaking blast it. Right? Like charge our nines, tens, pocket eights, queen, jack of diamonds, stuff like that. So here it's really the opposite sizing thing. Well here actually on that card, maybe there's some small betting here. It does not work perfectly, but we can still have some pocket pairs that villain could protect with a smaller size. All right. Actually I thought I'd take some more time here on those examples but they are they are quite clear and let's get to the exploitative thoughts it's it's not too much of a thing here because it's so it's more more like spot to spot so i only wrote down some very very very general things right we can break it down like with the with the what if villains put out too many bets on boards that actually hit us well this would be like lots of stuff for exploits right there already but obviously that doesn't fit into one slide here so what i wrote down here is very important is that we need to think about villains actual range not a gto wizard range right so if we want to attack villains give ups for example when he three bets from the big blind against some people we are talking about the ace eight off suits and the king four suiteds in the world against some people we are just attacking ace king and ace king only not so people are usually too strong i say that every single time it stays like that because it's still this is how amateurs play. So if we're playing lower stakes, 3-bets from the big blind are just strong hands and that tells us okay like they won't have any c-bets and then give ups as well. So hand in hand that kind of thing goes with over fold versus two strong ranges. Again what we said before on the three hearts run out, what is important is can you imagine villains bluff? If you think about calling a bluff you want to have an image of the hand you want to see in your head. Is it the busted offsuit straight draw? Is it the ace-axe of hearts thing? Is it whatever? Is it tougher to find bluffs? Do you think villain can find those? Do you think he can over bluff by any chance? Often the answer is no and often it's just like yeah but I can't fold that because it's a top pair and this is not a reason to be calling. We have seen that in that three hearts spot, king-10 was indifferent and obviously the the GTO wizard is finding the bluffs. Okay, overfalling, knowing the actual range, knowing the bluffs that villains should have is very very important. I think that comes up on the key takeaways as well but I might mix things here. All right and then when we come to action game it's really important. Lots of people have face up medium showdown value. I asked you, what are people checking on ace, king, x, or what are we attacking? And we got like four out of five people wrote down queens and jacks. Four out of five people, when you face that spot, will have queens or jacks. So this is, yeah, how you can attack that lower frequency, but big siz sizings choose your hands and attack them or exploitatively hammer on them when you know it's just this hand category they are having and even better when you know which point they are folding those probably against the first big bet people are just folding queens and jacks i guess and hope so for most and then there's another like i call it the team check means give up so last note here team check is give up you can't go too crazy with small sizings i'm using like seven percent bets personally in in four bet pots for example we're like you can tickle them like you know they are full of shit they are giving up like they bet big once six six No, like there's a type of player who will never check jam here. They will freaking bet when they have kings, queens, aces, just because they want to get the money in the middle. You can like, you know, they have two over cards. You can try whether it's 20%, 15%, 12%, whatever you think you get any more money, or you can just hurt them the most or still have the best risk reward if they end up check raising at some point so high frequency small sizing and if you know check means give up you have additional information on later streets so you can float lighter actually all right you know your river bluffs will be better because they are not trapping and so on so this is another idea here that we can put in let me read the chat quickly i made the mistake on a big mtt yesterday bluff catching when it was obviously wouldn't have the guts to bluff on that board yes typical one most players tend to under protect their checking range and bad boards for them making our small bet when checked to even higher eb allowing us to increase frequency over gto absolutely yes that's right just like the first decision is yeah the first decision is is this board good or bad for me and the same works the other way around if the board is really really great great for them and they check king 10-4 they either have top set or pocket queens and then it's like they may be called down so actually when it's a good board for them and they check we should even more slow down usually and when it's a bad board for them and they check we should even go more crazy because all this very very often face up hands if i overfold on earlier streets cause of sizing or other reads there will be runouts where i under bluff compared to solver villain perceives my range different and catches light does he lose in the long run assuming no one just in the future yes you under bluff the river he calls you made money right attacking turns after villain range bets and checks turn is super important put them on pocket nines on king six six queen and use your pocket fives and barrel them off knowing that we have to call range bet is only half of the truth bv implies that we need to attack on turns two absolutely but this is really gives you great feeling i really enjoyed that gto wizard drill i recommend everyone doing doing one of those if you have gto wizard if not watch mine a couple of times and think about what you would do in in my shoes i try i hope i played slow slowly enough that you can follow there and yeah pace up medium showdown value low frequency but high pressure that all like that means i want you to bet big but selected but if it's like five six seven you can bet small with all kinds of shit you can take your ace jack your ace queen your pocket eights everything if you decide to bet big because you need to like let's say villain checks on king queen four maybe you don't want to take every seven eight nothing but you take your four five suited you take your ace five suited with the backdoor flush draw but then like when you put in a lot of money you need to select a little better which hands you are choosing maybe some hands that make sense blocker wise maybe some hands that have like additional backdoor equity going on something like that do you have a share link for gto drill i don't think so but i can show it show it to you. So maybe you tell me where I can... not here. Where is it? It should be still in here. What did I do here? All settings. Three red pot. We have under the gun hijack cutoff button. GTO is opponent is small blind, big blind. We are in position. That's it. That's all I did. 500 rake. You can do 1K GG rake. You rig you can go low lower rig changes the the structure only slightly let's let's play three right why not right this is like you've got 25 minutes of that hijack versus small bind ace queen no nothing this is a clear fault pocket queens 943 our board we are mainly using the small size even though pocket queens is one of the first hands incentivized to bet slightly bigger what do we do we stick to the small size make things easy he raises we could re-raise now it's the first hand we want to stack off maybe even all-in is a thing we can call both will be somewhat fine i'm not sure which raise is the the best option i'll click the call button and hope there is no six of spades now and now i'll put it in against jacks and tens hope for the best and the turn i should only call okay i messed up but yeah that's kind of the logic what's the flop can we re-raise no we are not re-raising but it's it's only an inaccuracy ace 10 what is that board type are we betting small big i think it's in between We could use a bigger bet against jacks, tens, nines. We can obviously use a smaller bet against some ace, jack of clubs, king, ten of diamonds. So everything would be right. If in question, we usually take the smaller bet. I'll click the check button. He checks on the king again. Now I want to get rid of some pocket jacks, some eight acts, some pocket seven seven, stuff like that. And we can, I don't want to, this is tough ones I got here. I don't want to go for the bad fold. A big sizing sucks because of that. The small size I can easily call check raise, but the small size doesn't make any sense. So I'm really not sure with this one, but I click this sizing and now I think I I think I have a give up. So here that was kind of a tough one. Flop, small is fine, we find reasons for bigger, whatever and so on. Okay this won't be that tough. But we could do the same now. Do the same and think what do you have with queen 10, what with whatever. Villains bluffs, what are villains bluffs? Let's say we have a bluff catcher in that spot. What should villains bluffs be? Let's say we have king, jack of spades or we have ace, queen of diamonds. Knowing that is very important especially in game when you think ace 10 I doubt he has it from the big blind. So ace king I think is the the one especially the one maybe without the ace of spades tens nines do not exist from the big blind oh i recall he should bluff tens nines no no no tens nines are never in the big blind range and never betting flop and turn if they were but right stuff like that ace king it is we can look it up and you will always get that right he will have gto wizard will have the perfect hands right so let's quickly look it up here high frequency you can look at offsuit we look at ace king the one with the out of ace without the ace of spades i said so that makes me kind of happy another bluff is ace deuce bullshit wild one and then the ace of spades I said so that makes me kind of happy. Another bluff is the ace-deuce bullshit wild one and then the ace-king suited without the spades is one of the best. And regarding bluff catchers I thought about the king-jack of spades. I said that for a reason that we look at that random ace-queen, king-queen can be fine-ish and that's about it. it and i take up there okay so all right so this is a way how we can how we easily can improve here all right high frequency betting board we could have a raising range obviously this hand always calls turn we need to react to odds and outs all right against the big size with that queen out that's really shit would be would be an easy fold. Against third pot, there's no way we are folding. Check, and I think this is actually a check back, even though it hurts a lot. That's a very, very, very important reacting to those sizings here. So it's just, you can help here. Five, six, seven, he puts out this tiny-ish size. From the big blind, it's a different thing. He doesn't have king, queen offsuit. He can actually bet that very high frequency. He has those king, eight suiteds, queen, four suited, and so on, but pocket aces. We're going to go ahead and get started. tiny-ish size from the big blind it's a different thing he doesn't have king queen offsuit he can actually bet that very high frequency he has those king eight suited queen four suited and so on but pocket aces we're not doing anything if he bets now i can see actually a race and now i think we're just this seems fine but i go the slightly bigger one just because it's aces and i want to have max protection and rip it in so here this year is probably range wise the best size but just aces prefer that it's more like something let's say a new ace eight four two outer plus backdoor straight small sizing no no chance we go anywhere and we'll have a very easy turn decision i thought against the bet now here seven is really 7 is really tough to get them to show down, but we have 5s and 6s as well. I think they are mainly checking, hitting, and now raising small, I hope. This seems too much. Fuck. They get me here. They get me. I can't just call. Got him. All right. So I hope you will enjoy that one. There will be more hands of that where I discuss a little deeply. And then it's like, once you get it like this and the queens, I can live with that. Then you know, okay, this spot, people can't hurt you. And still, obviously, we did not exploit anything here so far. And yeah, that should work out then. And yeah, let's get to the, to the key takeaways then. And now I was happy to, to go a little 50 minutes longer and yeah. The last one was great. I actually got most of the same decisions. Perfect. Key takeaways. Again, pretty much the same thing like last slide, just repeating it again. Focus on villains, actual range. This is now the exploitative thing. Don't play GTO Wizard when you're playing NL5. Understand GTO Wizard, yes. Consciously overfold in the right spots, consciously overbluff in the right spots, consciously hammer on them in the right spots. In the reaction game, focus on equity versus value hands. A gutshot might be better than a pocket pair, even though you have no showdown value, right? This is very, very important. You carry, you play mainly call only, you carry things to the river, and then there is a decision. You want to make strong hands there. And then know the bluffs they should have. This is really the strongest. If you can't imagine the bluffs a villain has, then well, fold. A big game changer. And then action game, the golden rule I put it here, use the opposite bat size that villains should use and yeah, that will help you and just like know what you're attacking. Once you know what you're attacking, you won't mess up. All right, I hope you enjoyed that one and yeah hope you do as good as i did luckily in the in the drill and then you crush them some three bad pots i think i said it in the drill but now i want to put it out there as well because yeah i hope it's not too much of the things these days but like last year maybe two years ago already there were quite some gto wizard cheaters on the highest stakes. They were playing and all they did, they were actually quite shit in lots of spots. All they did was playing perfect GTO in three bad pots. Perfect ranges preflop, perfect. And they looked up every spot in GTO wizard on the side, which now you shouldn't do that. I mean, you shouldn't do it back then as well, but now they catch you easily and they had incredible win rates, better than the best players out there. This is how important three bad pots are. So yeah, just something, it's absolutely worth training them and not messing up. All right, cool. That would be like a computer cheating test. Yeah, absolutely. Cool. See you for the next one.
