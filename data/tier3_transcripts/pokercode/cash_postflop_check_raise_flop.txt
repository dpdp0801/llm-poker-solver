### TOPIC: cash postflop check raise flop
 So I'm going to start with the introduction. I'm super excited about today's session. Most of you know him already, Stefan Sontheimer, one of the best German poker players out there. I actually want to ask you later about your start because I am not actually sure that I know exactly where you came from. I believe you started with cash games and then basically just grinded your way up. Like the only person out there who just went from just straight from zero to money with no bigger downswings, I believe. Like Friday was a downswing. say that but yeah yeah not the typical not the typical uh donking around for two years uh losing money um players talking about the american story i won a satellite to the pca i got second in the main event now i have two million in my bank account decided to play 100k and win the next one yeah exactly not the not the american player story but the reason why I'm super excited to have Stefan today is we basically got to know each other really early in our career as players and spent a lot of time together also talking strategies probably the player I learned the most from over the years especially because he thinks very very different about the game than I do, always very logic-based, very strategy-based, preparing everything before he gets into play. And also I think one of the strongest person I know in memory and applying logics in the game. So when we were working on our huds and analyzing opponents, this has been super fun in Canada back then. I remember these sessions and just working with the tools and trying to get as good as possible. And this makes the two views on poker of mine more exploitative and intuitive and his just more with numbers and underlying strategies. So I'm very excited to host you today and have you here. And thanks a lot for your time. I appreciate that. And maybe you can say a bit about what you have in store for us today. So, yeah, sure. It's a pleasure to be here. And, I mean, you asked me for how I grind up. I started with 53 bucks on NL2. And the downswing was Black Friday and then I had to start back on NL5 I guess after Black Friday and then like we went there smooth. I guess we met when I was just like grinding Zoom 500 talking about Canada times. So that's my background. PokerStars and you like probably pushed me 10 times to finally play those high rollers live as well so um yeah um that's it and uh yeah now i just switch over and i will share my screen today um because i prepared a little presentation shout out to our latest coach class who gave me his that i could copy the style a little that always helps and uh i have no clue what they're asking me here um i'm just trying to share my screen let's see you should be able to yeah let's do that and here we are talking about what's the topic today it's like i want to come up with one of my favorite topics to just present where i feel like lots of people i coached um kind of had an aha moment or if you want to call it like that um because like the pattern of thinking is interesting for me there and i call it building check raising ranges deep stack i'm a cash game player i haven't been playing a tournament in a year just that one thing that I got got in for free I gotta admit and well it took me 20 minutes to bust that one off so no tournament poker today here but whenever I do a coaching it's all about the thought process I don't care about like just showing you charts learn that by heart that's a different way of learning which i accept and totally agree and i had to do it myself for like shorter stacks as well but the deeper we get the more we want to understand the game because it's just yeah the most important thing so today we are talking about building check raising ranges deep and the plan is to talk i call that not driven because we really like check raising with the plan of being all in at some point or like structuring our range that way. There are other spots where we are talking more about denying equity and stuff. So I just made that little hint there. So, yeah, I guess I'm good to go right away. I have no clue what this next slide will show us because I just, I didn't try it out. So, I'll just do it on the go. And lucky me, I got an agenda here. And, yeah, I'll just show you the ranges we work with today for like our one main example I'm having. Just showing that one quickly that everyone has an idea how freaking nitty us cash game players are, but like don't be scared or like don't think like oh what a bullshit, because it's not like torment rangers and defending all kinds of shit in the big blind with that big ante, it's still the same thought process and you should still learn something from it. It's just, well, we'll apply it in my game to make sure I'm not doing too many mistakes. We'll start with a little CBAT quiz. I've heard that you guys liked that when class did that. Then we'll talk about building those check raising ranges. We'll talk about potential exploits from both sides when we are the guy in position who can c-bet or when we are the guy who is like in the big blind defending and check raising. Like how to like play versus certain mistakes people are doing when c-betting. Then next we'll talk about turn continuations. There will be another quiz. And in the end, I have no clue how much time we will have left. And we'll talk through some hand histories maybe. So it will be mainly me talking, but I'll try to make it a little entertaining for you as well. Please participate in there. I'll have Fedor to back me up whenever I have questions I can ask someone directly to. Maybe he nails it every single time and I look like I'm just telling stuff that is super clear. Or maybe we would all love him to mess around a little. That would be more fun. And yeah, I can't tell you. So Fedor, you're ready to go? I'm ready. Let's go. All right. So, I mean, these are the ranges we're working with today wow this is tight i'm i'm playing six max cash game no ante right so these are actually solved ranges for zoom 500 uh rake so actually rake plays a role as well you guys when playing you don't have rake anymore you paid before so that's fine as well um but you see on the right side the opening range where like something like jack 10 queen 10 is not really in there um deuces threes fours fives like increasing frequency but like not really there right i'm always looking at the borders when i try to understand ranges low suited connectors not like that nice but yeah we're talking about like 18 percent here something like that and on the left side we see the big blind three batting range uh no big blind defending range um obviously you see lots of fans that are high frequency three bats so this is why all the suited uh broadways are missing here the parts that people are typically missing because everyone is three betting too tight up out of the big blind let's just say it that way and you see how much all that defending range is built around the suited combinations because well we see the tight range range on the right on the left king 10 off folded pre-flop i had to learn it after playing those high rollers as well playing with anti playing shorter but it's not making money unfortunately so these are the ranges we're working with but doesn't actually matter too much because we'll talk about the thought process but maybe keep them in mind a little just the borders i was just talking about so i would just start off with the open sizing did you did you say that uh just two and a half x yeah okay so um yeah let's just start with that and um everyone take pen and paper or your notepad on on the computer and we're talking about c-bet frequencies right we know the spot now maybe it's not a spot you are ever playing with non-anti but you can still give it a try you have seen the ranges i want to just like guess those frequencies maybe um i didn't even talk about sizings i had in my sim like small and big sizing like 30 and 75 as options um but actually on those that doesn't matter too much, just like overall frequency, the order is important. There's nothing close. It's super clear which one is the highest frequency and which one the lowest. So yeah, you take your one minute to try and nail it down, maybe even write the frequency on the side. And then we'll listen to Fedor whether he nails it or not. I guess that's a good time to start with. And if you want to you can obviously post your list of numbers in the chat. So if you want to have some accountability posted in there, you can compare to others. One more thing for you, Fedor, because that presentation is like super bugged and it does not run when I use two screens. I only see what you guys see right now, or actually I see less. I see just the presentation. So Fedor, you are responsible to interrupt me if there's anything in the chat. I don't see it. I will do. I'm the chat responsible person, so I will make sure. Perfect. So when you feel like you're ready, you just start off with your explanation, like starting off with the highest frequency board, et cetera. This is interesting, for sure. I can already say I don't find this so easy. Especially given the ranges, I very rarely play with exactly these type of ranges or even close to that. That's super interesting. Just keep those in mind for the low jack, those ranges, what I talked about. So we are lacking that jack 10, queen 10 type of stuff. We are lacking that deuces through to fives heavily and then it's just well the opening range should be kind of the same like in a tournament like an 18 range whether it's low jack for you or you open that from nine max under the gun i don't know i've seen someone uh opening pocket threes every now and then from very early positions and hitting sets against myself Hey Fedor. High frequency bro. Yeah For sure randomized Okay Can you just for a second show the ranges, just flick to them for 15 seconds again so I can see again? Thanks. for everyone who wants to think about it again. Thanks. Actually, I'll get a pen and a paper to write down what you're saying in case here. Because I can't write down somewhere. Okay. Oh, this is interesting. Let's start. I mean, the number one is easy. The highest, the highest highest frequency board. Yeah. Thank you. start. I mean the number one is easy. The highest frequency board, yeah. Don't say that please. I feel like I'm setting something up. Yeah, you're definitely setting something up. So I personally, my thought process in the whole thing. So the first thing I thought about is from experience of shallower stacks and um the situation where opener has a wider range i remember that a board like these paired boards um depending obviously on which which high card there is or which card is paired uh pretty high frequency c-bets with a small sizing so i would probably go so my first thought was board three and board five i would prefer board five um as my highest c-bet frequency mm-hmm so why board five over board three um i would consider that I mean now I thought that I would defend more 10x ratio wise then I would open but I didn't have enough time to actually look very specifically now at the Rangers this would have been one thing but if you said now that king 10 is not a defend from the big blind and you're not defending it from the big blind then i probably like that uh to see but quite frequently as well but this would have been one reason i remember there's some spots where it's like certain paired boards where if the defender has a lot more of the paired card in this range, you don't see bet it as frequently as Schroeder. Sounds good so far. Let's say, okay, those two are highest frequency. Next one. So now if I look at the other three, one thing that I find relevant is the nuts advantage on like nine, three, four. So if I don't open threes and fours, I don't have sets or like there's a set advantage, especially if ranges are rather tight given the opening size and the defending in the big blind with no entities. So the sets definitely make a difference so deep in my opinion. So I would probably, if I think about these three, then I would go rank the fourth board would CBET that with less frequency and CBET the second with a higher frequency than that. So this is one of the first things I look at that is what's the like not distribution of these three boards and then obviously a big relevance is the high card as well whereas nine four three there's more stronger hands below the absolute nuts in the openness range given that a lot of the defense like a lot of the really strong hands are three bets. So like nines plus basically, or tens plus. So there's definitely gonna be some part of the range I wanna be c-betting with a large size, but check quite often too. So that would be my thing on the board number four. So I would rank that quite low. Queen 6-5, not very made up mind on that one. I would probably choose a rather high frequency on that board, but I don't have a very clear logical explanation for it and queen 9-3 I would also c-bet quite frequently. So if I would have to choose, then it would be 5-3. 1-2-4. All right. Sounds pretty good. I mean, lots lots of things i hope just like for you guys that like all the thought processes that like fedor was talking about are are like happening in your brains right now as well just like we had so many words and we will come to that about like talk just about sets right about like talking about over pairs as like next best hands right so you nailed it down to like range part by range part um like the peers he was talking about appeared boards he was talking about his experience i guess like with a like high frequency small sizing i only offered 30 maybe a smaller sizing is even better just like attacking villains huge no hit part but we'll get to that so uh you almost got it right fedor the 10 10 5 is obviously better than the king 5 5 but the other three um are really the way you kind of said it right so 10 10 5 is really just like that high card thing where you said okay 10x relatively is just like better than five like five five four four four under the gun um and just the thing of a pierred board where like nothing hits the so the guy who was like uh ahead before stays ahead and can make use of that and one big thing and we'll talk about that a little more later is just what can happen next what can happen next can happen next? And this tells us, okay, whatever can happen next on queen nine three is way better for early position than the stuff that can happen next on queen six five. And nine four three, actually what can happen next is pretty bad as well for under the gun. Plus the problem, he actually has kind of a nut disadvantage right here. I agree that it was why I was pointing out those like that set problem so clearly right and this just should tell you a little about like how strong reads can be for example right if you know someone someone's rfi when playing deep stack in tournament that should tell you already whether someone does have deuces threes, fours, fives from like certain positions, or he might never have it because this totally changes that kind of board. Just like those nut combinations. Okay. I hope we've seen some good answers for you guys as well. But I'm pretty sure there are some. So yeah, let's see what's next. Actually, I'm surprised every slide is well. That's a good thing. Okay. So next question for you, Fedor. We want to talk about building that check raising range before we really talk more about where all that, like, betting comes from. So we talked about C betting. Now it's about building a check raising range. And actually, i i could have asked you but i'm a little scared that your answer is too good so i actually answered here myself already um from like my experience when coaching people they always tell me okay i ask them how do you build your check raise range take me through your thought process and they all the time say okay i have my value hands and i have my like bluffing hands right so um yeah i would just like maybe everyone just takes a minute again um to really write down for that board what are your value hands what are your bluffing hands and um maybe think at the same time about like what is the problem with that pattern of thinking right it's like okay value hand is six five a value hand probably is ace queen a value hand to check raise with i don't know pocket sixes for sure what are the good bluffs obviously we have something like seven eight we have something like a backdoor flush draw i don't know right flush draws open enders gut shots backdoors that's like just the usual answers i'm getting asking that question um and yeah just um just like take take that one minute to really write that down what you have in mind what fits in there for that board right queen six five was one of the boards where you have seen i just show again that it's just like like solver frequency is just 59 and it's only a small sizing never a big sizing allowed um and yeah it's like one of those boards that i'm super interested in and we will work on that a little more today because well fedor said it already he doesn't have something like no theory behind it but he would see that with a very high frequency which i'm sure is working well in praxis but it's actually far away from gto uh like i mean 60 i would just assume you probably bet it like 80 um and i know some people who do it for 100 which is yeah i think i think one of the big issues is when your theory comes from experience, basically. Yeah. Because if people don't really construct proper defending ranges against the CBET, then there's not really much incentive to find a better strategy. Because with your exploitative strategy that you initially started, you already are at very high ev spot exactly that's what happens very often i observe is it's like oh i queen six five if i look at it in theory i'm like okay it doesn't really make sense to see that high but if i can just see that for a quarter pot or a third pot and people are just not check raising or check calling enough then uh seems to be one of the best exploitative strategies right but now that being said you say like okay it's good to make something that we now can see or maybe even have known before that it's just like like far away from gto probably like from like a solved strategy and we know lots of players are doing that and there are way more or types like that that we can pretty much play the same so this is why we're talking about check raising today and we are in the big blind now and we know villains are doing something wrong and we want to know we want to know about again like my pattern i'm always talking about is like we want to know what would be right to then understand what villain is doing wrong and as the like outcome know what the exploit against that is. That's the goal of the session. And I hope like when the session is done, we all know how crazy we will go on queen six, five to take that already, to tell that already. So I guess everyone is ready just writing down those few things. And I guess that's on the next slide. And I just wrote some hands down right really where it's questionable right value hands sixes fives queen six suited queen five suited five six suited uh well we have no five six off because we are freaking nits playing cash games you might have it that might be something okay but we don't have queen six queen five off and for that five six off we have way more stuff that is just offshoot shit so usually like the ratios are kind of the same it's something like also one thing i want to jump in quickly here with is to everyone who most likely playing tournaments believes you know oh i just see that 100 in this spot i think it's always good to know the theory and then like that you're able to even understand it's like oh oh, theoretically it makes sense to just see that 60% here, but as an exploit against the population tendency, I'm see betting more. I think it's always good to have that backbone of knowing where the theory is at. So I'll ask you, I'm just talking about the value hands. Are you ever check raising ace queen here for value? Not often. No. Okay okay what's your reasoning for that um it's a good question i i feel i love sentences that start with i feel i love it i mean actually no i was just thinking about what I'm saying no I actually do check raise it um and I check raise wider than that too and I check raise a variety of different hands um that are not on the list but but um I just feel that especially in high stakes right now that people are like c-betting turn very frequent on these type of boards because there's so much fold equity on turn a lot of turns at least or like a mix of enough picking up enough equity and fold equity that I put a lot of my check raising hands in my check calling range, but A screen, I actually do check raise most frequently. Okay. So yeah, interesting, first of all. And you said, like, obviously that list is not complete. You know that, and I know that, but it's pretty much the obvious stuff I was talking about before right value hands bluff hands i just wrote down flush draws open enters gut shots and kind of king jack suited stands for the back doors which can be different stuff as well and this is just always still talking about what it's the the answer i always get when i ask the question about building a check raising range so i have to assume that this kind of thought process has to be the same for lots of you people too. And now I already put it down here. Then we try to bring those two things together and say like, okay, we need to have a ratio. Like one value bet gives me so many bluffs or something like that. Where I don't want to like ask even trick questions. And I could ask you in the chat now what is your ratio there, bluff to value. Some people would tell me two bluffs one value, which is like okay from a very very very simplified toy game when we check raise pot size this is where that comes from and there it would be right, but here we are playing with equities and the whole problem of seeing the world like that is that you neither take into account how much equity your pocket sixes have against Willem's calling range and you don't even think about how much equity your bluffs have against Willem's calling range. So it's really a spot that we need to find kind of a new idea and now it's the time, the time has come where I want to talk about that we really we talked about flop c-bet i made that quiz all right so peter was mentioning lots of the lots of the terms that we see right here uh then we i just asked like check building a check raising range just like without even talking about it before because well that would have like now the way i will talk about it will will hopefully help you to know like what what i want to aim at when it comes to check raising and um yeah i just like that the one question i'm dropping is just which are the factors that tell us which players should be interested in in building a pot and i even break it down to in building a pot of a certain size. So actually what I see the whole process when like all the bedding patterns from flock to river, or even starting pre-flop is kind of a road with a goal. And one of the goals is like the last one is like the all in goal, right? It's like, and so I see every bed or every big bed or every check race and every step as like a couple of meters or like one step further to that direction all in. And obviously it's a step into direction playing for half a pot, for half all in, like half stacks. Or playing for, well, I want to build like a pot that is just a little bigger, right much like pot controlling and this is what i want to um make you think of like which direction do i want to go with my range in general and um yeah just again take a look at those at those um terms and think about okay how does that influence either your bet sizing and your bet frequency what is like really what is like your main force that tells you to build a pot to start betting at high frequency or to check raise at high frequency um and again phil or you're the man you you got to do it so uh what's like what are your main drivers if we just say like okay queen five six yeah or nine five nine four three right you said even some terms like okay you have more sets or you don't have the sets i need to you need to deny equity a lot or whatever just just take those words and maybe let us let us participate in your thoughts that just come up Yeah, so in this specific spot or in general well you can take examples if you take examples take the queen five six or the nine four three but it's more general okay so in general um what i'm trying to visualize is the equity distribution i don't actually think so much and oh there's this term on this term also i not advantage i i don't count like not combos or thinking percentages for me it's more i see both ranges as a curve that um that work against each other kind of so if there's a certain part if i see the hundred percent hands basically for both parts and i'm thinking of drawing a line of how they perform against each other of how often which person has how much equity against the opponent's range basically with with how many hands or percentage of the range of that they have and so in this specific spot that's how I always try to then build my betting patterns according to that so if for example now I see the stack size as a multiplier. So if it's very, very deep, then it's very relevant. These, let's say, 5% of 100% equity hands are extremely relevant because they can be leveraged more. So I would then have to adjust more for this specific scenario because it makes up such a big part um so in this case for example in the queen five six scenario um where in a more short stack scenario um i maybe uh see that a bit more um or in wider ranges I see that a bit more, but now in this scenario, I feel like I cannot see that that much because there's some leverage that the big blend has when, when it's deeper stacked, given the ranges that we have. So that's why my answer was like, I think it gets see that not so often in theory. And so that's how I always try to think about a variety of different boards. So if I think about the check raising range here as well, I'm trying to think about which hands are naturally interested in building a bigger pot and then kind of think about which parts of which equity part basically can substitute that or can support that incentive and also play fine in that type of range. I'm not sure if that's... I gotta stop you here because everyone who is watching that video later again just stop it now go back one minute and listen to that again because it was by far the best answer i've gotten in all my coaching career right so it's really nailing so many things down right he was explaining how nuts and deepness like stack death how that really like depends on each other right you use the word like it's kind of a multi multi multiplayer actually i see it the other way around like meaning the same thing but just as like in as like how i understand is like uh i ask myself what counts as nuts we're like for 200 big blinds it's probably just like top three percent counting really as nuts. And they matter. And for like 100 BB, it's like top 5%. For 50 BB, it's top 10%. And for, let's say, for 20 BB, it's pretty much top 30%. We're like, well, all of a sudden, any queen you can like see kind of as nuts. And this is where kind of a small explanation for why those like the shorter you are, the more aggressive all the stuff gets because like on both sides pretty much 10 or 20 percent of all hands count as nuts kind of and and can be well leveraged in a very very small way although although i think it depends on the advantage of the equity because let's say your opponent has five percent of hands that just have 100 equity um then it's not necessarily changing with how deep you are but it more depends on how how much equity how many percentages of your hand actually have yeah that i think is super important that i often am not so good like it's i think it's really difficult often to to say how much how many better hands are there that your opponent can have and how many worse hands are there that can still it's really about that full range distribution and planning ahead it's not just that you can say like okay let's double check those ranges take the top five percent right we can do that for queen five six and for under the gun we are talking about well partly fives almost all sixes pocket queens that's not enough though we gotta add kings aces ace queen and this is where he has advantage over the big blind big blind has five sixes okay queen six queen five six five it's not enough so he gotta add king queen queen jack but that's not the way we want to think because those hands will be irrelevant when playing for really like nuts for when playing for all in because well we want to think about what will be nuts when there will be more cards which will which hands will really be interesting in the end and there we have all the draws we will see the advantage of the big blind a little more and um yeah what i want to like what i always want to think about is really that not what does it mean like those nuts i just described okay don't take the top five percent top ten percent compare them it's not interesting right now right so i would just define something like not equity as having equity versus villain's strongest range part so actually like that queen five six is our spot today and if we let's say check raise against that we know that well our equity is interesting but villain does not pretty much have any draws he does not have any three four any four seven any like maybe low frequency seven eight but the other way is not interesting this is why that spot it, it will be pretty black or white, just like very, very clear situations, pretty clear decisions. So I'm splitting that up a little, and nut advantage right now, really you can decide which hands are interesting. Fedor, when ordering those c-bet frequencies, he even said like 9, 4, 3, we have no 3s, we have no 4s, big problem. Let's just talk about nut advantage right now. And the other part would be nut advantage over time. We can take that board as well. Any five, any six, any seven, any deuce, even any ace. Kind of kills it nut wise for early position. The ace not too much, but just knowing, okay, like pretty much half of the runouts, big blind will actually have a nut advantage. And this is something that, well, people keep waiting for that and slow play until they are at that point. But actually, well, that's something we can plan ahead. And now coming back to the board we're talking about today, queen, five, six, rainbow. Well, under the gun, just think about which he is. Actually, he has like slightly nut advantage right now if we just compare top x percent versus top x percent but over time he's getting killed right any deuce any three any four any five any six any seven any eight any nine and we can just imagine how early position is bking when he's forced to play for stacks because then that's exactly those cards where ace queen is a pure bluff catcher pocket kings is a pure bluff catcher and pocket aces is a pure bluff catcher as well right so and this is i asked you before are you check raising ace queen there in that spot right we can check raise it like not just like to build a more like balanced range we could say to build more of like a more linear range to be prepared for different scenarios on the turn and not just be super polarized um but actually well it will happen low frequency and this is the main reason because it is not about what is good right now if If we think ahead and we know on average how the boards will run out, and we know which cards come how often, we can already plan to like our ace king, ace queen. How often will it be a value bet for stacks? Like how often? You need the deuce-deuce run out. And then it's like, do I rather check call against air or do something something else like really that check raise that bet for stacks well happens probably 20 of the time once you hit one of your five outs which i would consider the ace or queen to be um and this is really something i want you to think about um it's not just nuts right now it's mainly nut nut advantage over time. And the deeper we are, the more important it is. Okay. So, yeah, I'll just drink a sip of water on that to let that sink in. And now we want to come back to our board and do pretty much the same thing, but not with value and bluff. Just another way of thinking, because I don't want to split them up. It's not about, okay, seven, eight is a bluff. I don't care. Ace queen is a value bet. I don't care because when we do that, we are just talking about right now. I want to know, well, I'm planning ahead. That's why I called it like nut driven check raising ranges, really play planning ahead. My advantage in the big blind is that I will have way more straights on certain runouts and I want to leverage them and I want to leverage them right now. And like doing that, I want to have that, that thought process of, okay, everything that is interesting for me, when I take, when I taking the first step direction all in is how likely is it that we can value bet our certain hand on the river for stacks right we can check raise that bet all in right maybe we need some overbets depends all on the sizings villain uses for a c bet we use for our check raise etc but now we can put those two things just into like one kind of linear pattern we can sort that so now that's Thank you. raise etc but now we can put those two things just into like one kind of linear pattern we can sort that so now that's just i want you to do it again right we're like in the end we have one list of hands that are i would call it potential check raises and we can sort them by how likely it is that we can value bet reverse for stacks with those certain hands right in the very end, there could be like actually we could keep and put our whole range in that order. And I'm just thinking about what the last hand would be. Probably some kind of, I mean, Jack four suited, how bad is it? Jack four of hearts has a backdoor straight draw. But like just in theory, we can we can have now use that thought process to come up with kind of a list. Okay, so Fedor, on you again. I kind of make you work today. So how would you list those things? Just like you can snap it through, right? And you guys just, you can do it for yourselves. Maybe Fedor gives you 30 seconds of an advantage and then you nail it down. I'll give you a hint. We'll start with pocket sixes. But then really think about that. Where is your order? How likely will it be to value bad river for stacks? It doesn't have to be like scientific thing, but just like your feeling. Is that enough of a head start guys? I mean so my first thoughts are sixes and then fives pretty pretty good one pretty good so far so good um i'm actually not so um not so heavy on the queen six um and the queen five more so but also not that much on that. I'm very much like the four seven suited and the seven eight suited. Obviously open enders an advantage, especially with backdoor flush draw over just a gut shot. You're talking about playing for stacks for value, not how often you all in, right? No, we can value bet the river for stacks. That's the only thing. Maybe including a little how strong that value bet is, right? We could maybe value bet queen six, but it's just like probably getting like having 60% equity against the calling range at some point. So it's really about like if a value bet queen six but it's just like probably getting like having 60 percent equity against the calling range at some point so it's really about like if a value bet is better like seven four you named it like just like drawing to the stone cold nuts uh that's obviously like we can include that there a little i mean one thing one thing in these scenarios um obviously you can now think about okay when is it a value bet so obviously all the open enders back to flush draw are kind of the same except that there are some blockery effects in play so Obviously, you can now think about, okay, when is it a value bet? So obviously, all the open-ended respect of flush draw are kind of the same, except that there are some blockery effects in play. So it's probably a bit more likely he continues with 9x than it is likely that he continues with 3x, which is zero. So he doesn't have 3x in his continuing range. So it's just more likely that um that we make certain straights but in general um i would pick like seven eight over something like three four because i think there's also um there's also reverse implied odds in some sense where i rather make a straight with like four seven then the straight with Three four for example, because he will probably come to you I mean you don't really open eight night soon it under the gun, I guess but low frequency super low frequency But I think this is something relevant And then as for the gut shots, I mean, I think what plays a role too is like, besides that is flushes are always obvious value bets, backdoor flushes, backdoor trips happen very rarely. So this doesn't really matter. I mean, besides that, I don't really see much of stuff that is relevant. I personally would include some more pairs like 6x and 5x. I'm not actually sure how often that gets check raised in theory but I intuitively I would do that. Okay so that's pretty good. I'll just see what's next on here. So because this is something we're adding in here I just made that list where okay I gave queen six queen five just like from the way I asked the question like I just put it ahead of those open enters but it's really something to think about and it's so important because well everyone would say queen six suited is a super clear check raise here but actually if you see this first step direction all in and you think about you think ahead how often can you value bet that well queen six is it a value bet when the turn is a king on the river for stacks right when villain has pocket kings and all king queen offsuit combinations same on an ace same on a five same on any period run out it obviously sucks right run outs like seven eight or eight nine something like that happens so it's like it's kind of tough we're like five six for example it's probably the same value right now but actually has good blocking effects right because villain has more ace queens and we are blocking the sets that we are losing to a little more than with like queen six queen five so actually five six should probably be ahead of those i'm not like convinced by my list i just wrote it down pretty quickly but this explanation just really shows okay ace queen is really really far down there it's like really low chance that we can value bet that on the river for stacks hundred big blind steep and now it's really that the way you put those open enders in order right it's that's just that like okay seven four is clearly the best right three four seven eight is actually close three four you said like okay villain does not really have seven eight so three four for check raising and barreling is a little better because sevens and eights are part of villains call and fold at some point range um but it's it's like kind of drawing to the nuts but not like a hundred percent right seven villain might have some eight nine suited or should have some plus. Again, there could be a seven, nine, seven, eight run out just like decreases that value slightly. I really want to think like more precise about that instead of saying I have an open ender, it's okay. And now you said already, right? These are just hands. And I want to say we need more, right? If we just use that question, you named those already, those peers. What actually is 6-4? And when we think of like chances to value bet the river, or I'll take 6-3 as an example. Hitting a 6 makes us the freaking nuts. But hitting a 3 makes us the freaking nuts as well because villain obviously doesn't have 2-4 or 7-4. So really that, okay have a pair i can play it as a pair but against under the gun what is a pair of sixes worth nothing right villain doesn't have even half deuces threes or fours that then might check down so actually my spear of sixes is worth kind of nothing and six three suited can be a five outer to the nuts plus a vector straight draw plus plus a backdoor flush draw so that brings us to like let's say 27 percent to value bet the river for stacks something like that sounds pretty cool right and that should be actually better than some of the gut shots and obviously we can include again hitting a six or hitting a three is not like the stone cold nuts right hitting a three on the turn river is an ace well villain has nine combinations of ace queen that beat us and he has three combinations of sets that beat us so it's kind of okay uh not like 100 value bet when we hit our outs but it's really important to think about what changes things right six four suited makes a little mores, but therefore the two pair is a little worse because villain might hit a straight when we hit our two pair. That's six, seven, same thing. But just thinking about those, super important. Next step would be okay. Not even cards that are making nuts on the turn, but something like king, seven suited. big door straight backdoor flush ace seven same thing right maybe it's just 10 to hit right how much the king is worth or the ace's worth is not like relevant for that question but overall obviously it's still good to hit a king or an ace like we're not planning to value bet those four stacks but i mean obviously there's value in that another three outs or even thinking about something like what about those top pairs right um queen four i think the chance that we will be able to value bet it on the river for stacks is higher than with ace queen just because of the backdoor straight draw and uh well the two pair is actually better as well like queen seven um because it's just not such a good card for billum um and just like thinking about that and um yeah now we have that whole big list of hands that when we see the checklist spot like that all kind of makes sense and We are thinking about really that we are going direction all in. We are thinking about nuts. We are playing for stacks. This is where villain can get hurt. Under the guns, advantage is kings, ace is ace queen. But once they are not nuts anymore, we're fucking him. That's the plan. Okay. So this is now my first takeaway that is super important is just knowing what you're drawing to and i add that exactly there right what i was just talking about you're not check raising because you have bottom pair you're check raising because you have a bottom pair with a clean three outer to like a two pair you can value bet right not one that makes villain lots of offsuit straights for example right plus you have a backdoor flush draw plus you have three two straight for example all right so stuff like that and really thinking about okay will i be able to value bet it for stacks again that example king seven suited on queen five six backdoor straight draw backdoor flush draw plus okay the king is kind of cool i can value bet it for right instead of saying i have an overcard in those backdoors it's just i have that part that i can value bet for stacks at some point and the other part is like okay to play like a medium-sized pop so that equity is worth something just like gives you way more awareness really give your hands the right names be precise with what you're having and that will help you in game so much and even on like less interesting boards i wanted to say but like boards that look a little worse for villain uh for for the big blind let's say king nine deuce right um i mean obviously five deuce is the way better check race than an ace deuce because your five is freaking clean best to pair out in the world right um nine seven freaking cool check race maybe if we just take that rule and i guess now is the point where we just look at the pile range once uh i guess that's the next slide, maybe not, but here we are. I hope you still know the list. Let's take a look back. We started with sixes and fives, queen six, queen five, but actually I said, well, probably they are lower. And the other, all those open enders we're starting with, gut shots, et cetera. And what we see here is exactly that list list and we came up with that one just like without using piu at all right it's just we can even think about the frequencies right it's not mix the higher the hand is up in our list the more frequent we check raise it right sixes and fives were in the we're on the top queen six queen five somewhere there five six makes it to 100 almost well but more for like not just the quest like i mean as well right the blocker effect is part of the question as well like can we value bet the river right we block sets we unblock ace queen so it's just more likely and then coming to those open enters, seven, four, seven, eight suited. Four, three suited, just always, right? We're coming to the gut shots, right? The more nutted they are, the higher frequency. Deuce four is a gut shot to the freaking nuts. Seven, nine, eight, nine. Well, it's a little worse because of the blockers, but still gut shot to the nuts. Something like queen seven. Well, we have a top pair, which means a five outer to two pair in trips, plus backdoor straight draw, plus backdoor flush draw. These are high frequency those with a backdoor flush draw. Ace queen, we talked about that one already. Super low frequency. And then, well, something like ace four, king four suited, suited backdoor straight backdoor flush draw over card and maybe did we see like some super just backdoors like king 10 suited like that's not the ones we need at high frequency but yeah so this is like maybe hopefully the first little aha moment that we say like okay we came up with that list we didn't even look at piyo we just used logic with understanding what does a check raise mean what is our plan behind that where is the advantage that we are aiming at and this is just nuts nuts nuts and i say all in all in all in and um well that leads to that and we can do that for every board now i hope i could give you right now king five four eight six five jack whatever seven five and you can come up with check raise strategies and then you can compare them that's your first homework now yes i'm giving homework uh you do that you make that list you double check on pio and you will see you freaking nailed it this is what will happen which means okay now you've learned how to set up in those spots a kind of perfect check raise strategy and well the worse the hand is kind of to check raise the lower the frequency is but now next we want to talk about is exploits so what we see here is most importantly to me that it's just this this is the freaking baseline. We talked about that before, three steps. First, we want to know what would be right. This is what I consider to be right against the right frequencies, against the right CBET frequency. Second is what is VILUM doing wrong? Third, what is the right exploit? And we can obviously talk about that, that if we are playing against fedor who just wow hey everyone that he is c betting too wide on that board i mean what are we doing when we are check raising right i don't like our goal is not to get up to that freaking frequency of 19 in that spot our goal is to know that baseline to then decide whether we find a reason to stay tighter than that. We won't find one, by the way. And, or we find a reason to even go crazier than that. Going crazier can mean two things, just increasing some frequencies here, or to add new hands. So it's really, this is why it's important for me that there is no end to that list, right? To that list we can write down, there is no end. In the end, there might be pocket deuces and it's a freaking two outer to a set, right? Actually, it has a backdoor straight as well. So it's like, it's not like it's impossible to check risk that in theory. So yeah, let's talk about those exploits. That's just what I said. This was the baseline. What's the c bidding size um 30 okay big one is like six percent in pile with like some kings but i'm pretty sure if i keep it running a little longer that will furtherly decrease so i'm just like expecting that lower bet size which brings us to the exploits well, the low bet size is the only thing we can do in theory because big blind has so much incentive to start building a pot. The big blind has that nut advantage over time. So he should work more on building a pot, which always tells you as like being the seed better, there's no reason. But now we all have kind of the same read that probably people are not check raising enough right because they don't see this year as the baseline they see that as the maximum and they call their 8-6 and they call their 8-5 and they call their 7-6 and they maybe only check raise their sets half the time as well and check raise their open enters half the time as well so now question for figor again and everyone can think about that what are our potential exploits and so i just wrote down some things we can think about and i'll start off as the c better now we're talking my language I'll let everyone think for a bit and think myself My language. I'll let everyone think for a bit and think myself. Yeah, I'm back in a second. I need some more water. Yeah. All right. I'm ready when you are. Guys, I think this is a really important part. So everyone in the chat who's watching right now, for sure, think about, okay, how do you exploit in either direction? What do you do when you deviate? and again what i I just said, be precise with that, right? There are now 10 people out there for sure that just say, do I want to say it? Yes, I can say it. Just say, okay, he doesn't check raise enough so I can see that wider. That's not the answer we are looking for. So be precise so just commit like so uh just posted exactly that in chat and then posted rest in peace sorry bro not okay yeah um but fedor will tell us the truth i guess this one will be another one he will just nail yeah i'm not sure but let's see so um sc better i mean one of the things now what are my assumptions so my assumptions are if i know the optimal strategy then i'm assuming that let's say we lock in the pre-flop ranges and we assume that's exactly his defending range then I would assume very heavily that people are not check raising enough on this board so they would probably not check raise enough of their strong hands most players and where there I think it's not not huge part missing, but I think they probably call their set sometimes and they probably call their queen six and queen five too often, which I now learned also that plays apparently better as a check, or more often as a check raise, but I personally would debate that or consider, like, think about that. And then the bigger part is more how often they attack um with hands that can make really strong hands um with like on different runouts so not advantage over time how stefan called it um so my first adjustment would be um to um basically consider okay if i know that if i I like i think the imposition player now has an advantage in terms of considering which run out comes right because there's also certain cards that favor certain parts of opponent's hand a range and some parts that don't so let's say cards complete more straights, especially the lower ones like a seven or an eight or three are probably an advantage for the player out of position and maybe a card like a king or a jack, maybe even an ace or a ten, are probably cards that favor more the in position player. So considering that, I probably want to see more runouts with a large part of my range, especially these type of mediocre bluff catcher is showed on value type of hands. So yeah, I would increase my frequency to CBET more with a small sizing with mediocre showdown value hands that I don't really want to defend normally against the check raise. So let's say a hand like ace 10 that might be a decent bluff catcher against some of his check calls like 7-8 or 4-7 on specific runouts. Pocket jacks, pocket nines, whatever. So I want to increase my c-bit frequency with a small sizing with these hands that rather fall in my checking range. And then I probably also consider to take one part of my range that I choose a larger sizing with that actually folds out some of these hands where people are probably over folding to large sizing. So let's say he has a hand like deuce four or has a hand like seven, nine or eight, nine maybe. And I choose, let's say, 60% to 75% sizing with some of my, let's say, a hand like jack-10-ish, blocking some of his continuing hands, like queen-jack, queen-10 type of stuff, I actually might introduce that into my betting repertoire as well. And versus a check-raise, I will be over-folding, because I believe they just don't have enough bluffs in their range. And I will most likely continue with blocker type of hands, which I don't really have too many of. And then just my highest equity bluff catcher type of hands and then play very cautiously or specifically on certain runouts like eight X or 3x or um so that would be my answer pretty good um very detailed talk but everything pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty really good and um yeah just because i mean it was a kind of a long explanation but this is exactly what we need right just like it's not about okay it's A, like villain is doing A, so exploit is B. No, there are like lots of different things happening for different range parts, right? So if we think about our, like lower, like weaker range parts, but that have equity against villain's continuing range, those are against exactly those that now make it better see that instead of a check, right well we face less check raises so we have like not to bet fold as often and then our ev of betting obviously increases but at the other other hand we have hands that actually benefit from from villain check raising but there are hands like i could ask people what are what is the first hand you want to bet big but actually there is never a hand that wants to bet big it's just about getting money in the middle right and it's about understanding well how does it work like how is villain's incentive to put money in the middle and if we now know that villain's incentive to put money in the middle is high but he is not doing it well we need to do the job ourselves so actually first thing i would be doing as well is just like i bet big with my freaking pocket fives right um i can bet big with my pocket kings i'm not like calling his check raises and he is check raising his queen seven sometimes it's not happening so first that's the like the the assumption i just i mean that was uh i mean peter repeated it but i i hope that was clear that we just say okay they're not check raising enough it's like maybe slow playing too much but for sure not having all those kinds of like parts in their in their check raising range which has like that six seven five four not check raising all the open enters not check grazing most of their gut shots etc so now we could go even deeper which i don't want to do right now just like just like putting the idea out there thinking about turns and rivers right which hands do they have too often now if they are check raising not enough probably all their six sevens and four fives are in their check call right which will lead to over folds on the turn right those hands shouldn't be in there that often and it tells us to like really make a difference on what the turn card is right it turned king he will never have it right but and all his gut shots are shit now snap folds and all his bottom peers are snap folds now as well so actually we could we could play with a 30 percent of barrel just like as an idea for an exploit we're saying okay actually in the end if it's queen six five fedor even said so he c bets ace ten now turn is a deuce river is a deuce villain's betting well if he still has like he should never have seven eight in his range because it's a check race race but probably he has it 7-9 8-9 7-4 7-3 um well 3-4 got there um but yeah just there's not like one read and there's one exploit to it there's just like one fact and that means different things for different lines and different range parts so actually we just named probably like five different kinds of exploits that can work against that guy right now versus checkers we are obviously over folding the turn uh the flop now and we we can like we will be better at evaluating the turn card how does it inter like not interfere like interact with with his check raising range that is like or even we can say um what that's uh i missed that one when when continuing on the turn well like there's a seven or an eight like okay he should actually not hit that too often because this all that stuff that hits that is in his check raising range but now we should like slow down so insanely um probably he's not playing aggressively enough on the turn as well so we can still like just bet our kings and aces to then check back um but we should know about it well villain just like improved more than he should in theory right so this is just another key point just like thinking about okay different kinds of exploit exploits there is not just one now coming to the next step as the check raiser now fedor you're playing against fedor and you know he is over c betting and we can guess that for lots of people there are lots of people that are seeing queen high rainbow board not even thinking about nut equity over time and straight stuff and all that shit. They see that a hundred percent. So what's your plan? I mean, go ham. Here we go. Yeah. I mean, I would just check raise a ton. And regarding sizing, I mean, I don't really have so deep thoughts on sizing but i would definitely increase like basically the list we went through earlier um i would just widen that um i i think a really big part um let's say he continues optimally like i oftentimes i struggle with if someone cbits too often then do we assume like say he continues optimally like i oftentimes i struggle with if someone c bits too often um then do we assume like an optimal continuing range or do we also assume how he's continuing versus a check race we assume a human continuing range yeah and that's kind of the the thing so most humans i think just overfold significantly after they see bit too much um but there's also some players who play back where then uh it gets really tricky check raising too much with uh pretty low equity type of pens um but but yeah so i personally first instinct just increased check raising frequency significantly yeah just that that was my understanding right it's not that this is not like that was our baseline what we looked at which is like Thank you. instinct just increase check raising frequency significantly yeah just that was my understanding right it's not that this is not like that was our baseline what we looked at which is like far more aggressive than most of the people out there so actually i want to see that as a baseline it's like this feels like your 45 percent open raise on the button right if the big blind is always folding well we increase that to 60 or even 70 percent so this is how i want you to see that check raise as well if you understand okay it would be 19 in that spot why not not go 25 or even 30 by keeping the structure of your range obviously you will be weaker because to those 100 of sixes you are check raising you cannot add another 100 percent of sixes you just don't have those so in the end the end, you will have more gut shots and stuff. But as well, you can take that queen-axe. Your queen-jack. You can take your queen-jack suited backdoor flush draw. You can take some more of your ace queens. You see like those, like the Americans call it always like trace plays, right? When you just like see traces of it in pile. And it's like already fine. This is why I want you to make list not only for high frequency check raising hands but even do it all the way down to hands that in theory gets check raised zero percent i just like to be open for adjusting in both directions and i haven't see i haven't seen a single player where i wanted to adjust in the tighter direction i haven't't seen it so far. And the sizing, exactly. We are like, first, when we think about sizing, it's about which part of villain do we want to attack? And probably he's just checked, when he's c-betting 100%, he's c-betting way too many weak hands. So we want to attack those weak hands, which is, I started with like a very small sizing, pretty much on all those boards. I just use my 50% hotkey. It's kind of keeping my range together. It's like a super great risk reward and just opens it up for like the turn. Because as Fedor said already, the turn will be pretty, let's say, polar. Very good for villain or very good for us. There's like, I was looking for a brick. On queen 5- queen five six there is no brick okay um now let's continue a little because i feel like we're behind time but um like important stuff is important and we we need to like talk about that but i think next is about talking about turn continuations um and i just showed you that i thought about asking question, hey, what would be the best or the worst card? You can probably find it. I think Fedor named the worst card like when he was talking about it. He named like three cards. The worst card was obviously in there. And the best card for villain is, well, interesting as well, but kind of obvious if we think about it, right? So, don't make you search for it now the best card is the offsuit three right we're like deuce four gets there four seven gets there really the nuts plus all the two pairs plus all that other stuff makes an open ender and all that even random king seven a7 has a gut shot and still an over card the worst card is actually the jack of hearts but obviously a king is really bad an ace is really bad but the jack villain makes a set villain has queen jack off at least partly and the main thing is why it's better than the king is that well we don't have any jack in our check raising range pretty much on the king we have some like king seven we talked about that and have some some king queen ace queen um ourselves so these are the worst cards but you see what i meant with polar there is not a blank where it's like okay i don't know like 10 plus is super great for in position mainly because out of position doesn't hit a shit right um all that straight stuff is insanely good for in position five and six are kind of the bricks where we need to think about okay like our value hands get decreased because obviously when there is another five we have less combinations of pocket fives but at the other hand we are improving to let's say five four suited which is trips now stuff like that this is why we need those hands well. If we don't have those in our check raising range, the 5 and the 6 is just really, really, really bad for out of position. And the only kind of blank in between hand is really that 9, where both players have a little 7-8, but mainly in position picks up nut equity with his floated jack-10, king-10, king hands where he is like still he has some nut equity going on even though the nine is a good card for out of position bringing some straights there that's kind of the in-between card so now i guess it's the next quiz right away we want to think about turn continuations and i just gave you exactly those three cards and i want to keep it simple so we stay rainbow no flush draws out there and the question is guess the frequencies in the solver for the following cards i gave you three options and for overbet first question before starting that is question to you Fedor why didn't I set a bet size here? Why didn't you? What would you set as a bet size for the overbet? Somewhere between 100 and and 150%. Okay. Why? Um, good question. Just seems like if I would want to test a solver for, um, different bed sizings he's choosing, I would want to have something that is not too far away from 75% to showcase some kind of indication of how often he's choosing really big sizing. Okay. If he chooses 150% rather often, then I would consider to even bet bigger. What would you think the solver would choose as an overbet size if we were 300 big blind steep? I mean, I think I haven't really thought that, thought much about that, but I, I would think that he would build small pools for each sizing with so low frequency that it becomes really difficult to draw good conclusions from it um because i think there's definitely a range you can build around two or three hundred percent um betting size if you have if you have nuts that your opponent doesn't have like it's just there's no reason not to i feel exactly so the main point is I just wrote over bet down there because it depends on how deep you are. Right. So for like normal sex sizes and let's say where, when we say deep and like that whole system of building not driven check raising ranges, let's start with that. Like 60 BB plus, right. The whole theory works for like, like lower stack sizes as well, but then like really different hands can count as nuts. And that makes the whole system a little, little less appealing. But for that, it's really just deciding that we want to get stacks in right. And the basic bet size should like, once we decide three of hearts, we have deuce four, we have seven, four, we have five, three, we have six, three, we have those nuts that we had that we check raised on the on the um on the flop that are still nuts villain did not improve at all on that three then we decide now we want to have a sizing that goes direction all in right again talking about those steps direction all in and it's just okay we take the same size two times and we will be all in. That's kind of the goal. So the overbet size that we want to use in that spot depends on the stack size. And if we take extreme examples, like the one I just gave to Fedor, 300 BB plus, now it's tough. We cannot just take one bet size and play our 7-4 and deuce four differently. Because we cannot take our 3-5 as like in that same sizing. Huge sizing means villain only has to call a few hands. And, well, 3-5 for that stack death is not a value bet on the river anymore for a 700 BB pot, 600 BB pot, because villain is just calling sixes and queens, let's say. And therefore, we need to find that trade-off but with those stack sizes overbet means we are pretty much deciding now we are going direction all in and that is kind of like we can find the linear sizing for that with like 30% flop cbet 50% flop check raise that's around like 130% 400 bb stack size that's the one 130 135 that i'm using in my games mostly in game but really it's not about the overbet if we only have like less stack behind it can be actually our 75 percent can be that life right if it's just two times 75 percent to get all in well then we'll take that one and now feel free to go for the quiz and just guess randomly and think about which size to choose why what are like those more or less frequencies and um fedor feel free to help the team um to maybe just tell them a little how you evaluate those turn cards how good i mean we have seen the ev that obviously the three of hearts is good for out of position the jack of hearts is good for in position the nine is kind of in between yeah so i mean the first step i'm thinking about is kind of doing the same process on the turn as on the flop is thinking about okay what's the equity distribution two different Now the end position player had the chance to kind of select his range continuing to the check raise on the flop. So his range is definitely more coordinated and stronger on the turn now. So one thing that makes a big difference is how much um nuts are being added and on the three as stefan said and explained there's a lot of nuts being added on the jack there's basically no nuts being added and on the nine there is some being added and so the first things i'm thinking about is okay if there's no being added, then we're in a worse spot than we were basically on the flop. So my strategy in this situation, that would be the easiest thing to think about is, okay, if I have a pretty polarized range between low equity hands, because now there's only one more card to come that almost never win at showdown but a lot of them like 4-7, deuce-4, 3-4 maybe some 5x or 6x and my still nuts like 6-5, 5-6, Q6, Q5 and that now got a little worse because he can have jacks he can have queen jack my strategy would be similar to my flop strategy which is very high frequency of check and maybe some mixed over bets between some of the good bluffs and some of the nuts that i still have but probably most likely checking and then check raising again because now villains or like or heroes incentive under the gun would be to deny that equity right because if if we have a lot of open enders or gut shots that we still have and he gives us the free card that's decent for that big part of our range so this would be the easiest card for me um logically to to think about um the three of hearts i find um that shifting in our favor where we have so many nuts where i definitely want to have a lot of over bets in my continuing range which would probably be the majority if i think about the range that i have i mean i have fives and sixes and four seven and six three and then also a lot of high equity hands like the ace four i check raised um it's not going to be all of it, but it's going to be a pretty high frequency, I feel. So I would say probably not 100, but almost all of it I would personally overbet on the turn on the three. And if I don't overbet, I would still probably bet on this card. So maybe with the smaller sizing. So I couldn't really think of a hand that I would want to check on the turn given the equity and not equity advantage I have. So really strongly protected. I want to, although mostly put all my hands in the overbetting range. And then on the nine of i would say um it's somewhere split in between now where i want to deploy an overbetting strategy i want to probably have um a checking range just because my range is not strong enough to be um just betting with most of my range and so i would um i i know you put on 30 and 75 percent there so it's most likely going to be chosen but i don't understand or i cannot really find the logic on like building a range like that so okay so i'll stop you here and um yeah i guess this time It was two minutes, but again, guys listen to it again because i won't ask you now in the chat for giving all the answers i'll just show them to you i was obviously fooling you trolls but fedor nailed it that small sizings is like something i get in my coachings a lot as like the option because it's like okay we check raise queen five six the turn is a jack but i still want to bet my eight nine because it has equity so i bet smaller which is like very very wrong it's just like well it's really what fedor said it's just about okay first thing we need to evaluate a couple of things seeing that turn card how does it interact with our range how does it interact with villains range will we be talking or like we are talking about how many nuts did we improve to and the question our flop nuts let's call it nuts something like five six are they still nuts right where pedro mentioned all of that right on the jack of hearts we didn't add anything and the problem is that for example our five six just decreased in value villain added jacks and villain added queen jack not sure whether he has an offsuit that often or not but same thing for the nine kind of right villain has like well seven eight just partly um but he has pocket nines at least and let's say queen nine suited so our five six got worse really it's about the new nuts but as well how do our old nuts still perform on the and the three therefore is such a special card here because all our nuts from the flop are still nuts villain did not improve to any straight to any new set to any two pairs to nothing right so our five three is kind of nuts against his aces and kings now our four seven our deuce four etc so fedor said he wouldn't check anything actually these are like those few queen 10 suited queen jack suited ace queen off that are just like now not good enough to go for like like for for all ins those are in a checking range but that makes sense that makes sense yeah i didn't think about them right so actually like once you're facing someone probably this checking missing. And when he's checking, he's probably just checking four or five, which is just the biggest mistake in the world. Just like not keep betting with those. Six, four, right? Just like it still has plenty of, not equity. It's not a freaking mid-peer that has some showdown value and open energy to try to get to showdown. No, it's not. So let's think about that again. Like how do we get to those frequencies and the sizing? So really that kind of a guideline of how to think, how to think how strong are my flop nuts still? First thing, right? Let's take the three as an example. Again, five, six, still nuts. Queen six, still nuts. Five, still nuts. Six is still nuts. That's pretty much it. How many how many new nuts did i add okay plenty of two pairs an open ender which i have a hundred percent plus a gut shot that i have like pretty often because it was not gut shot all got there okay um how often will those nuts be value bets for stacks on the river the straights%, 5-6, 80%, 3-5, 80% when the board does not pair pretty much. So all pretty strong. And there, I won't go that deep, but something just like, again, to think about is, well, how does a flush draw make it different? How does a double flush draw make it different? On a double flush draw we will for example see very very different sizings because we we know on the on the turn well our straights will only be nuts kind of 50 55 percent of the time right regarding some blocker effects um and villain will have flushes our two pairs well it's like, kind of a 50-50 thing. So it's really like on the double flush draw board, for example, we use a smaller sizing because we will polarize later. We will use a smaller sizing and bet. And then if it's offsuit on the river, we will two times bet the pot with our straights that villain can never have and with our sets because you should raise them on the turn, etc but that that's getting too complicated for now would extend the lesson a little but um yeah that's just ideas to think about um now thinking about like i just saying like okay that queen six five was just a very very very extreme example now we see like two things on the turn, very good or very bad card. We understand, okay, actually the frequency depends on how good the card is, but actually the sizing just depends on which kind of pot do our value hands want to build. And that question is answered the same way, even on the bad cards, right? On the bad cards, let's say that jack of hearts, our sixes, our fives, they don't try to build a smaller pot now. They still want to go all in. It's just a question, do we bet ourselves or do we let villain bet? And that's the trade-off to understand, okay, it's not about the betting. I said it when it was about like betting big on the flop. It's not about the betting. We have certain hands and the only goal is to get money in the middle. I don't care whether I bet myself or villain bets. And this is talking about turning exploits right away. I'm sticking to like betting myself a lot because villain, as Fedor mentioned, has lots of reasons to deny equity. That's right. But they are just not doing it. That's the problem. So in general, I'm overdoing it with the c-betting there a little with my nuts and my checking range is kind of unprotected. I can tell that if there are not too many cash game players out there that play my stakes. But I will adjust. So yeah, that's really kind of a point. And yeah, another thought is what other stuff can happen, right? first thing i wrote down is both players at some nuts right let's say an off student straight gets there there is a reason why i chose early position versus big blind because the ranges are like very very different button versus big blind we'll have like often like both players improve but obviously seven four suited it's more like a thing that the big blind will have but then we have at least seven eight suited hundred percent both frequencies or let's say once we get to the offsuit part check raising on ten eight something and both players have all jack nines well what happens then we need to think again about where is our advantage right and then it might not be in the nut part anymore. And then we choose a sizing which is not going direction all in because direction all in just means we are interested in the nut part. Or like something very special when both players add a lot of nuts, right? But we might still want to bet because we are still stronger, but our advantage is not in the flush area. Maybe it is in the straight area. Let's say queen five, six with a flush draw turn is the three and the flush gets there. We have our advantage with having seven, four and with having four juice, but it's not in the nut area. And that leads to downsizing, right? Play around with that a little, right? Just check that out. Build your, like make your lists, check your check raising ranges, build those and really think about, try to be precise, right? This is why I said that here. By choosing a certain bet size, you choose the range you're playing against. And you want to know what your value is you have against that range. How likely is it that you can value bet? What are you drawing exactly to? So this is pretty much what I just said. Takeaway number two, know where your advantage is exactly. Is it in the nut area? Are you trying to pressure villains, kings, aces, and ace queen on queen six five? You know he will hate the river on pretty much any run out. And well, where's our advantage? Which sizing does that dictate us? Right, okay. that example was we're going all in, no smaller bets exist. If there are flushes, well, villain will help you build a pot because he has flushes too. That tells you, okay, your advantage is somewhere else. Maybe you are just trying to get 50 big plans in the middle, which means forcing villain to only like continue with let's say 10 or 20 percent of his range total. And when your advantage is there, you're making money in the end. Villain's either playing with bad hands or he's over-folding and both is good for us. So yeah, I guess that's it. Some hand histories, let's see. Yeah, maybe we'll get to like just read one hand history. What do you think, Fedor? any additional stuff you want to say any questions coming up that would be the point right here right now maybe i'll build that presentation for now to read that stuff as well and you all see all that stuff here so one of the things i want to add here is i mean first of all thanks a lot stefan for this part. There's been some super crazy insights in there, for sure for me as well. And one of the things I want to mention from a tournament perspective is to not, to take this as a Kickstarter of thinking about how much stuff there is out there that you can think about to get better and improve, but not to take too literally so this was 100 big blinds deep very specific opening ranges on a very specific board where it's very extreme if you look at other ranges shorter with ante um different positions different boards you will see very different results so um not not so high raise check raising frequencies or not so high over betting frequencies and so on and stefan mentioned that but i i want wanted to highlight that again um because it's really important that you don't go to tournaments now and just blast it off check raising uh every board and then over betting turn um but it's just it's just a kickstarter to think in this way because if you if I think you can draw you could see that even though I didn't know the solution and I don't play much cash game just by thinking that way I could somehow pinpoint or go in a somewhat good direction just by applying the logics that I've learned over the years so this is what I would highlight from everything i've seen that stefan just shared is to not take it too literal it's really i would i would agree there 100 it's really just like like really telling you okay this is what you can work on i don't even want to say like what you should right it's like all up to you right what you can work on to improve in a certain area right i was working on that that was like my main topic working on i have like a monthly topic that was made and until now i feel like okay this is my my like the the spot that i enjoy the most right it comes always up deep cash game defending big plans obviously but i can even force them to get into that game tree more often because well i will play better there than them like no way they put more work in there in that game tree than i did so just like we it's that you can work on that different way like one kind of like one way of thinking right i did the job now for you to like come up with that instead of really digging deep yourself looking into pyro synths and come up with some rules that pretty much always work um so it's kind of that jump start that fedor was just like talking about and then then put the work in right and enjoy it and like uh right enjoy crushing those spots they are fun right it's like it's about building pots it's about having full equity it's about showing up with those five suited on the river that's what we all like if we are from brazil right so let's go so let's look at one hand and apply it i would say uh okay winning or losing hand i mean come on stefan I make two oh now we see the hands that wasn't the plan, but doesn't matter. Okay, so two hands. No, you don't see my screen right now, right? No, you have to share again. Even better. So we make this one big. We're just playing a little enjoyable Zoom 500. You see the screen? Yeah. Okay, so we're defending against 2.5x. That's now middle position, not under the gun, but we don't care. 10-5-4, right? It's not that far away from our queen 6-5. Villain should not always have 4-5. It should not always have this and that and this is not exactly what i was like talking about before when i said i know the baseline now i know that this is a maybe a very very low frequency check race but i decide i want to overdo it i i won't like give you a loaded hud or anything now but that was my assumption right here that he is oversea betting that board he's not having He's not having nuts and not advantage right now and not advantage over time. His advantage is jacks through to aces, and they are not planning to play for all the stack. Maybe he likes to get three normal bets, and it's my job to not let him dictate the pot into that direction. I go either all-in or I might fold earlier. So yeah, he c-bets as expected, small sizing on the board, totally fine. I know that it's like maybe a little overdoing it, but my seven as a two pair out is clean. My four is clean. I have three twos straight. Actually having those pairs are better when you block his four or five suited combinations. Just something again to, to think about. It's like not having the backdoor flush draw. Actually, the four seven of clubs would be the cool one here to have the backdoor flush draw and block one of his nut combos. But yeah, so I'm obviously going ahead. Check raising, he calls. Turn is an eight. I mean, guys, it doesn't get much better than that. So what is our our check raising range i could ask you now to write down the list right i'll just do the job for you it's pocket fives it's pocket fours it's 10-5 suited where i'm not really sure whether i defended pre it's 3-6 suited it's 6-7 suited it's deuce 3 suited it's probably the way i played it 5-8 suited,. Four, deuce suited. Four, three suited. Five, six suited. Seven, five suited. Something like ace three, ace deuce, ace six, ace seven suited with the backdoor. So yeah, we are crushing it here. It's kind of a three on our queen, five, six. And this is now we are not having bottom pair. We are still having kind of a of a what is it a nine outer to the nuts even like i can still almost i mean hitting a seven is not nuts but like pretty good how do you feel about hands like queen jack and jack nine here um it's like they are improving in spots where villain improves too so i'm rather going for those black or white spots where i can really leverage once i hit right queen jack would be more like if we are shorter hitting a jack or a queen is like hitting the nuts but here it's just like okay a backdoor to a straight that he has himself is always worse than a backdoor to a straight that he doesn't have or and at the same time it's exactly i mean blockers on the flop are usually not the biggest thing in the world because it's blocking queens and jacks but it's mainly blocking king queen and king jack and ace jack and ace queen off too so it's kind of has upsides and downsides but it's always the main factor on like okay am i hitting something that i can value but on the river? Queen-jack, and how good is it? And there I talk about, okay, it's like, yeah, not that good because he has it himself. What I find really interesting is when you look at these somewhat binary spots, I mean, they come up quite often where it's like, okay, you have maybe a third of the deck that clearly improves one player's range and a third that improves the other player's range. I somewhat find it interesting to take hands that rather improve on the third of his because i'm definitely going to bluff and have a very high success or like very high equity on bluffing the cards that improve mine especially if it doesn't really contain his range because i feel that also like let's say on a six or seven or three or backdoor clubs like people are even over folding versus what they should be calling down yeah um so just something that i find interesting to to look into yes the quest like that's the the the bluff thing is for sure a thing and it's like something that i would take it that way which is super important that we check raise enough on the flop that we still have bluffs if we get the perfect runouts right it's like this run out you can fold to everyone in the world you're just a catcher right if you have pocket kings and it's just a catcher against 99 of the population we can just easily fold the turn because they didn't check raise enough to now have plenty of bluffs but if they just have their six three suited when they defended pre that's not enough right um that's that's a big thing and then it's obviously good when you have queen jack but i would say queen jack is just like a little further down on my list it's still a potential check raise but i have hands that on the value side improve to better hands and i can make more out of them. Yeah. Okay. So, I mean, it's obvious. This is now pretty much that 2E sizing, actually a trick you can do in Pio. Just put 2E in there and Pio does the job for you to calculate the perfect sizing to get all in over two streets. I think this, I don't know what I did here. That was what I did manually in game. But yeah. And well, he calls and we obviously get there. But it's just important. Never, ever check here. Never, ever choose a different sizing. That's the way to go. And thank you, buddy. So now I don't want to show only winners. That's interesting. Like, what do you think about this call on the river? Yeah, it's just, I don't want to show only winners that's interesting like what do you think about this call on the river yeah it's just I don't know Pio will tell you it's even minus Pio usually tells you that everything is 0 EV once you have a catcher but this has to be a bad one yeah yeah I mean so basically I mean on the stakes this must be a losing play on against the ever even against the average good reg right yeah 100 so it's basically because of the ace deuce ace three part i mean i can see that because it's but the question is if it's enough on the river i don't think so yeah that's the problem yeah so okay l5k okay let's play for some money at least so 6-8 suited here we go where again i prefer check raising those hands now i have a problem that he is an unknown to me or like he's i think that was an acr or something uh i know the name but i well no clue so i face a half pot bet size we're actually this is something that we can take we talked about exploits as well some people will tend to bet bigger with their stronger hands which then means that we can attack their small betting range even more right again something that we should take into account i decided to just treat his half pot as kind of a normal small c bet um it's fine to bet bigger on that board and i prefer that one here a little over all that king 10 queen 10 type of stuff well queen 10 is an open enter i prefer that obviously but it's again hitting a straight where he doesn't have a better straight 10 8 suited i don't really think uh think think so. Obviously, I would prefer, I mean, not really 8, yeah, I mean, 8-7 has again the double gutter, but yeah, well, 6-7 would be shit. So this one is a pretty cool one. And again, thinking about what are we actually drawing to? Something like 5-4 is really, really, really good check raise here. Something like 5- five six clearly worse. Okay so I'm check raising he calls turn is a six now. Vamos! Yeah I obviously I have seven eight obviously I have well five six I don't have it but okay shit and yeah obviously this is a good one to continue with against the button my six might be worth something and we start checking at some point but really what are we drawing to and here well again uh just like his it's not about the overbet size i don't want to bet 150 here because he bets half pot on the flop i need to adjust my sizing to get like all in with pot pot pretty much here um that's what i'm doing here and that jack well what i'm doing here is i'm bluffing my set blockers i have from the flop pretty much here. That's what I'm doing here and that jack, well what I'm doing here is I'm bluffing my set blockers I have from the flop, pretty much my 5x or like having heart would be cool and my 6x I'm actually giving up. Maybe he's scared of bluffing his queen 10 so no way I'm folding, no way I'm bluffing here this one. That six is not a set blocker, he never has sixes. So yeah, so really thinking a little about that as well okay just like two hands kind of applied taking the the aggressive route where um well obviously i found hands where they called me but there's like it's it's pretty insane how much full equity you create and like then even the i I guess the most DV for me right now comes out of the continuation play because just looking deeper into that game tree, it tells you, okay, what should villain do? And you understand what villains are doing wrong, especially when they take the check raise and then over-bet line themselves. You understand what they should have and where they probably are just super bluff heavy. and um yeah let's wrap it up with those two hands um maybe fedor having some last words maybe one more question um feel free to to to ask um and yeah i'll just yeah i mean uh this was super insightful i mean i can i can say so i learned a ton in this session now. Also inspired me for some other things I want to look into. I mean, no anti-cash game is not necessarily what I focus on, but it's for sure interesting. And to me, it just showed me, again, how many spots there are that you can look into and learn something from. And the part I like the most personally is to have your own inbuilt P PIO solver basically where you can see if you apply smart logics you will get very similar solutions than than what PIO is suggesting because in the end it's nothing it's like it's nothing magical it's just trying to find the best equilibrium or the best strategy for for two ranges and I think getting better at, that's the thing that's fascinating me. So, uh, yeah, thanks a lot, Stefan, for this insane, this insane session and value and sharing that with us. So, uh, I think everyone watching and, uh, who will watch in the future will, um, have their brains fuming after the session. So, uh, yeah, I appreciate it a lot. So, and now I'm off to my favorite pizza place and you guys all jump in the sunday grand exactly so good luck everyone uh and i'll take that as the last words yeah crush it i want to see some title titles in that in that slack celebration channel okay we'll do and then you'll all be back next sunday we'll talk about we can tell them right is it out there that we're talking about some blind versus blind yes more boring stuff to everyone uh next sunday step is going to be on again so uh it's uh just gonna get hotter um i'm really looking forward to that because uh blind versus blind is something that happens so often and applying, applying that in real life. So everyone out there, I wish you all good luck in the grind today. If you're playing, I'm definitely going to be in the streets battling the guys in the high stakes. And yeah, I wish you all the best, crush it, win some trophies and post them the rail thread and success channels if you win something if you run deep uh give others the chance to uh enjoy your success especially stephan he wants to see the tournament wins he loves it that's it guys wonderful spending some time with you have a wonderful sunday and keep crushing see you next sunday bye bye bye
