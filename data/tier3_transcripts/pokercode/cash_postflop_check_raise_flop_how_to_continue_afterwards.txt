### TOPIC: cash postflop check raise flop how to continue afterwards
 Make sure to join the Kahoot as well, kahoot.it, because we will actually start with a little question as I usually do in my community coachings. Today won't be like a big fight in Kahoot for winning something. It's mainly more open questions, just a couple where I wanted to ask you stuff to get a better idea of how you're thinking or maybe point out stuff that I think people are generally thinking about in the wrong way. Yeah, not too much, but still worth participating. Yeah, let's actually get started. And as you all know, you chose the topic. I was a little hoping for the other ones because it would be a little easier to just go through hands and really just tell you on the spot what's up. I tried to come up with topics that all fit to the content of the last four weeks. So it's not just about what was released last week. In the last month, all the videos were mainly about the reaction game, how to play on the flop, facing a c-bet out of position, but about flop action game in position as well. So just talking about that in general would have been interesting too. We had some good discussions going on. I like a lot the quizzes from Thibaut, just how you guys participated there. And this is just the way of learning. And yeah, I hope you've seen all the videos regarding the little principles and the general approaches. You have an idea of the dice principle of the lookalike principle so i can try and implement those terms a little more whenever i'm talking just just thinking about you guys knowing what i'm talking about instead of like when i'm streaming for example i feel like i need to explain every single time but now i hope we have a little. You have watched most of the stuff and most of it is clear to really use that to then dig a little deeper, maybe pull up Odin or Pio for one or two or three hands and really have a deeper look how stuff is playing out in certain spots. And yeah, I think so right now we are 24 people now, 15 of you in Kahoot. So one last reminder, make sure to participate here as well before we really, really, really start with the first question. This is where you should be. If you want to want to participate and interact with me here, obviously the chat is open for questions and anything as, as always. Yeah. Let's see what the next slide brings. I have a little, where did it go? Actually, I see my awesome preparation, how I do it. I have a little paper that is actually cut off here with the seven questions because I'm such a Kahoot noob that I always mess up. And yeah, let's see what the next slide pretty much brings. And topic today, how to continue after a check race. So one of the last videos that was actually re-uploaded and was a coaching I gave during Poker Code Academy that I liked a lot because this is my favorite topic, building check raising ranges. And I hope you have seen that. If not, still try to get the most out of it today, but make sure to re-watch the whole show there it's now not before i didn't like that that is it is hidden so much just anywhere in the mtt section under community coachings sorry for that joseph simonich so everyone who knows him that was him he wants to visit me i guess in two days let's actually make that on mute yeah how to continue after check raise is the topic. Now I lost what I was talking about. Thanks to Josep. Yeah. My favorite lesson I was talking about is just building those check raising ranges. How do we do it? If you want to figure that a little more out, what is like, how do I think here? It's not value and bluffs. It's something else. And what is it all about? This medium part of bottom peer and something and backdoors and et cetera, et cetera. Make sure to check that out. It is now in the cash section as well in the training ground facing a seabed out of position where it fits perfectly. Yeah, let's see. Yeah, next slide, the situation. Let's just clear things up again, what situation we are in, in all the spots we're talking about today. And yeah, let's start with what we did was depending on our advantages on the flop or disadvantages even, we decided to create a check raise range. So that happened already. There you see again that I'm not thinking in terms of value and bluff right on the flop because it's all about equity and not just equity versus full ranges or anything. It's about equity to really get stacks in. For me, building a check raising range is the first step directional in. So we really think ahead already already and this is why some bottom pier with like a clean two pair out might be a better check raise than some pair some top pair top kicker type of fans that are obviously right now way stronger but yeah all that was in the other coaching i was just talking about that you can see on the platform. So how likely is it that we can value bet? River Force Dex is our main driving force when thinking about check raising ranges. But that happened already. We did that and now we are on the turn. What do we need to do? First, we should know our range, which we built in the first step. Now, what is the next thing? Well, there's a turn card appearing every single time. Sometimes it's a brick, sometimes it's changing the board a lot, and sometimes, well, something in between, right? So we need to evaluate how that turn card interacts with our range and how that turn card interacts with villain's range to re-evaluate the whole situation. By doing that, well, we figure out the spot and can actually come up with a new wardrobe, right? We decide which sizings we want to use. What is our plan? Do I just use one sizing, two sizings, three sizings? What makes sense? And to get to that point, we will think, as always, mainly about nuts. Where's more nuts now? Which other parts in my range am I having? Who will improve to more nuts on certain river cards or not? So the same process as always, pretty much, or as on the flop, just a a new spot and some things will be different here and now let's start that kahoot quiz here and the very first question let's have a look well actually just i want to know what you struggle with and this is just an open question no points to be. This is your chance to tell me what are your struggles after check raising. So we are talking about that situation when we are on the turn. What is your problem there? What should I talk specifically about in this coaching? This is your chance to really tell me your problem. Try to keep it a little short and not too many wall of texts, Just like be precise there. Is it the sizing plan? Is it the how to continue with weaker hands? Is it like which draws or I don't know, right? Come up with anything. I'll leave you enough time to really put in your answer. And then I'll have a look to get an overview for myself and really customize that session a little for you guys. Oh, you can type beyond the time anyway. That's, well, good info. As I said, Kahoot Noob. So thanks for all the info. And I take the time to write back Joseph to tell him what the fuck is wrong with him to call me now. All right. So 12 answers. Let's see. Show answers. When do I continue betting? And when do I check? And what sizings? Right? So pretty much all the parameters. Right? Building our wardrobe on the flop had two steps. Thinking about which sizings to use and then which hands in which categories. So betting or checking is like sizings as well. Checking is just the sizing of zero. What bet sizes are in our wardrobe and how do we categorize the specific hand in it? How to use dice lookalike, the allow principle. Okay, I like that. On the turn, I get it somewhat on the flop. Find right frequencies is always a term that is like, okay, I'm not sure. But it all goes in the wrong, not in the wrong, in the right direction, in the same direction I wanted to say. It's all about, well, frequency, sizing, some kind of unsureness, which bluffs are going to speak small, right? You're already talking about having small bet or big bet. Now the question could be how big is a big bet, depending on our stack size, maybe. How to well what strong hands to check very good question how to control betting frequency not to over bluff how to continue with weaker hands fearing punting it off not getting enough folds so you're scared of bluffing thinking about when could villain be over folding or just thinking about this is a little exploitative already, how to continue when the turn is not good for me? All right, I'll give you a little hint. Accepting it and not invest too much money is already the first step. Bet sizes on the turn cards. Problems with Josef. Plan with medium-strong top pairs, especially king-x-x, queen-x-x type boards. Do we rather check? Can we still value bet? All right king five deuce rainbow he see that small i check raise something like king jack because the solver shows me i should do it sometimes now on the turn i have the problem that i only want to get one more bet in but there's two streets left fuck my life right it's like that type of thing very tough spot for me personally okay how often do we continue to barrel so you see it's pretty much all the same things bluffs how to play the strong hands how to play the medium strong hands how to keep frequencies under control how to evaluate the board in general which sizings to use after deciding which sizings to use, deciding which hands or bluffs fall in which category. So pretty much just all of it, what I expected, but that's great. So yeah, let's continue here. What I came up with next, I think I just talked about general thoughts next. It's always a surprise. I mean, I did that small presentation this morning, but it's always still a surprise what comes next. And that brings us to the next questions. And actually it's right. Exactly what you were writing about is what I expected. So the same problems I had or still have when thinking about it. And the next step would be for me to think about what are the goals actually of our certain range parts. All the ones you mentioned, what is the goals of my ear, of my strong draw, of my weak gut shot? What's the goal of something like the King-Jack on King-Five-Deuce that I mentioned? What if we check-raise Queen-10 on Jack-9-Deuce and the turn is a Queen? A middle-ish top here, something like that. What's actually the goal of our nuts? And now we'll go through that step by step and I want to see your answers. So think about that. That will be one question after another and we start with the nuts. So first question will be, again, just type it in. What is the goal of our nutted hands? Again, we are in the situation. We did check raise the flop. We are now on the turn and we have a freaking nutted hand. What's our plan? I only gave that 30 30 seconds, but now I learned that you can keep typing. So don't worry about the time too much. All right. No clue why I can't show answers so far. Okay, coming. Show answers. Okay. Playing for stacks on river. Nutted hands want to play for stacks to get as much money in as possible. We can choose aggressive, but also passive lines for that, I guess. So I will click on that. Just everyone read that through one time and think about that. This is pretty much the perfect answer right away. So I'll just read it out loud again. What is our goal to get as much money in as possible? And then adding we can choose aggressive but also passive lines for that I guess. And our job is mainly to find out which of those we should choose. Maximize EV is very standard. We always want that. That's like really does not help. I mean it's obviously correct but it doesn't really help me come up with a plan to get as much chips as possible by the river size to get stacks in on the river. So here, you see the difference? This year is what I expected a lot more actually. Talking about betting. This year is talking about betting and this is the first thought always. We have the nuts, we want to bet, which is actually not necessarily correct, Our goal is really just to get the money in. It's not about betting or checking. It's about getting money in, in which way we can achieve that. We need to talk about that. Get the stacks in by the river, bet right here, bet as well with an addition geometrical bet size. We will talk about bet sizes as well. And geometrically all in for everyone who is not familiar with that term just means the same percentage of the pot on both streets right it's like could be pot size turn pot size river that would be geometrically yeah betting geometrically and something we can use that's like a term coming from pio to just type in is 2E. It's just a bet size. I will use that later in the quiz as well. It's 2E and then the solver does that automatically. Get the most value, not scaring opponents off while charging them value. This is talking about betting as well here. So you see how it's like the difference of some people just talking about betting, not really thinking about checking and some others seeing the whole picture and really talking about just getting the money in. Okay. To get the stacks and make the bet, right? So you're talking about just the bet as well. We can think ahead already. One more question is what actually the turn card is good for villain, right? Do we get more money in by checking potentially, right? Because he should bet more often because he has such a clear advantage, et cetera, et cetera. So you see already some answers I'm super happy with. Some others where I think like a little bit is missing and this is the point where you can learn right away. Okay, let's just check the chat here. Something happening. Something nuts is a bad bad word I don't know what the stars mean here so I'll just skip that. Okay and let's go with the next one you can guess already now we're talking about part two what is the goal of our medium strong hands think about the king jack on king five juice we check raise turn is a freaking nine or the queen 10 on jack nine deuce turn is a freaking queen what is actually the goal of our medium strong hands in that spot okay well if we get the same answer pretty much like for the strong hands to get to showdown cheaply to see the river i mean that's not talking about pricing if the goal is just to see the river it can go go all in check or small bet that's not for me a goal that's more like a way to reach a certain goal right so it might be something like to get to showdown cheaply is my goal and my way to to achieve that is to check or to bet small and then hope for the best right don't want to blow up the pot while giving the right odds for opponents to call a worse hand right not like we want to yeah we want to either bet small or check to keep ranges wider to still be ahead of his range if we really go directional in well we only get called worse. That's not good. Or I'm using the term as well now, only getting called by worse just implies that I'm betting. But actually, it's not what matters. It's about to get money in versus worse hands. Whether I bet and they call, or I check, he bluffs and I call, or it goes check, check. It's the same. It's about money going in versus a range I'm hopefully ahead of, or at least make profitable decisions. Maximus, our equity realization, right? We want to realize equity. That's correct. Not get blown off our hand or to only get charged from a very strong range to lose minimum if we are behind to get one additional street of value if possible right that is exactly just i i see how you have the example of king jack in your mind pretty much right we'd show on as cheap as possible getting to showdown to get to showdown so we see all the words here we see pot control we see a small bet check, which well now here is the first problem a totally different world or like incentives that or a goal than what our nuts wanted to achieve right so on the one hand now we have usually something in our range that wants to slow play and on the other, we have something that wants to blow up the pot. All right. Now, next part and obvious last question. What is the goal of our draws here? I'm like, actually, I'm most interested in those answers here. So try to really think about it. Take your time. I can even give you some more time here. Think about it. What do they actually want to achieve? Mainly draws, like we don't have too much full random air probably. I'll give you some more time i want to have like at least 10 so we have seven answers so far keep going team all right let's have a look full mental bluff mode fold equity make the better hand to fold win some pots that don't belong to us and still lose the minimum. Taking down the pot right now, making better hands to fold. At the same time, we prefer to have some additional equity. Maximize our equity realization. So we have here something actually that is the same thing that we wrote down for the last category. Fold out better hands, better hands worse hands all right so here we have a problem guys what is a better hand i don't like that word if we are not on the river better hands or worse hands because it just makes things too easy and it stops you really thinking about the spot. So I like the term equity versus something way, way, way more. It's people thinking about, hey, I have it now, like on the flop. What is better, a 12-outer draw or aces? Well, with aces, you are ahead right now. But the 12-outer draw, it's pretty much a flip right it's like that i have the better hand it's the feeling and i it's like yeah he wants to fold you out or whatever i don't care too much right it's like whatever what i want to achieve by betting always is i want to fold out something that has good equity versus me right so it's like i just want to fold out hands that have equity it's like there's one more street to be playing whether i have jack high and he is queen high i don't care whether he folds that now or later i will never go to showdown with my jack high probably so it's like yeah i don't care too much but the getting equity to like getting hands to fold that i have low equity against and getting hands to call that i have okay equity against that's the goal actually with two things maybe one example if i let's say i overbet on the turn with a low flush draw i might get villain to fold better flush draws that would be something that is golden for me because well against those i'm pretty fucked up but if he calls like his random pair or not that i have strong equity against still that's actually fine right so it's always that and when we talk about a little later about which hands fit in which category this is something to think about what am i actually achieving am i folding out something sure that is better than my hand that's always okay right but it's like how do i actually perform is it zero versus hundred percent or is it i still have 20 to hit the freaking nuts and he has 80 or do i have 35 with my super monster draw and he calls with 65 that's fine Thank you. it i still have 20 to hit the freaking nuts and he has 80 or do i have 35 with my super monster draw and he calls with 65 that's fine right or do i fold something out that has 95 versus my hand that's a big success so i want to really think a little more precisely about that and kill the term better or worse hands for flop and turn. Especially like pre-flop, that doesn't make any sense. That's like pre-flop equities are still close when you don't run like aces into kings or anything. On the flop, equities for hands that are interesting still matter. It's like, yes, we are check raising bottom peers with a nice two-peer out because they have freaking 20% versus an over peer 25 if they have like an additional flush draw so it does not make sense to say like yeah you're way weaker no you have 25 versus 75 or you have 40 versus 60 within with a flush draw 36 or something or you have 32 33 with an open ender so the better worst term just takes that part of poker away. We can talk about that on the river when we can make a clear ranking by showdown value. Then we can talk about better and worse. All right, so I thought we were referring to the river also when talking about our goals. Okay, okay, then we're good, right? But then we are talking about the river. Right now, I'm just talking about the turn. For the river, we can use it, but I hope it still makes sense to you. And this is a big takeaway because the more precise you can talk about your goals and what you want to achieve with a certain line, the better your results will always be, right? It's just, I gave, I think in Slack, someone asked me yesterday, like, or two days ago, he's like overwhelmed with all the stuff he learned now. he's always lost when playing in-game now and he was asking for advice how to handle that situation and i saw yeah that's just natural and it's not possible to really nail everything so i gave him the advice to really have that session focus every time just for on one spot or two spots. Obviously, we're trying to play as good as possible, but it's just not possible to learn all disciplines at the same time. So focus on one or two. And one big tool or like idea I use is just talking to myself. Whenever I can make sense of something and I can justify it for myself, it cannot be that bad, right? If you tell me you're overbetting the turn with a low flush draw to make better flush draws fold, how bad can it be, right? If like your assumption is correct, at least. But okay, okay, fold out slightly better hands, realize equity withdraws, realize equity, yes, it's a big part as well, right? It's like in the air that we get caught by something we still have equity against to make better hands fall to balance them when we have nut hands so they can't just always fold i like that a lot so not the better hands part but to balance when we have nut hands so they can't just always fall. Because here we have the first combination of two of our range parts. The air is a tool to force villain to make the calls. If we are just betting our nuts, well villain can just fold all the time, right? Which I'm a big nit. I like falling to people who are not creative and will never have enough bluffs. They're all like just fold because they have it most of the time. But we can use random cool, not random, right? The full mental bluff mode. We can use that. And by doing that, we force villain to keep calling, which gives actually additional value to our nuts. Okay. So very interesting. And I hope we had some small insights from just going through that right away. And I think this is, let me check. Yes. The next, this was always already the few questions. And now I wrote that down myself here again, and I put down those exclamation marks because it's just so important for me. The nuts are really there. Their only goal is to get the maximum money in. By check calling, check raising, betting small to get raised or over betting themselves, I don't care. These are all options that make sense. And now we look at the next parts where I already tried to combine them a little, which we have seen in the last answer I showed you. Part two, they try to see the showdown cheaply. Obviously, everything you wrote there, realize, I mean, it's not my perfect answer. I just wrote down something. They are not interested in blowing up the pot. They want to keep the pot small, maybe one more bet in a small bet in check, check, and then a bigger bet, whatever. But by having those hands that want to see a showdown cheaply, we give villain incentive to bet. Bye. And then part three, well, I wrote it down like you did so you can make fun of that. Fold out better hands, which I told you, it's bullshit to talk like that. So you see, I didn't put that much time into that presentation, to be honest. I thought about it a lot, but not for writing it down. Fold out better hands, total garbage that I wrote down there. I would like to change it. But mainly that means we're giving villain incentives to call. Your third point is wrong. Yes, you're right. Here we go. Right? So this is how we learn the most. And now what you hopefully figure out is the wrong understanding of everyone approaches that spot. First of all, check raising range. Everyone's too value heavy. Okay. Because just like the, the with nuts, it's easy with non nuts, it's tougher. And then on the sec, like when we are on the turn, what is everyone thinking about? Everyone is thinking about nuts. And nuts means betting. Where actually we don't care. It's like there is nothing like betting written down here. It's just they have the goal of getting the maximum money in any way as possible. And now we can see already, hey, part two and three are actually way more interesting. How much of part two do we have? How much of part three do we have? And that tells already the incentives that are given to villain. Let's say, let's create an example that does not exist in the real world, but just like a little mind game. We get to the turn with just part two and part one. So actually we have hands that want to get to showdown cheaply and hands that want to get the maximum money in. Well, what should we be doing, right? This part here, we only have part two, gives villain to to fire hard on that right to build a polarized range to fuck up all those weak top pairs and then well what's probably the best way to play our part one by checking right if villain decides to play a high betting frequency then he kills our part two we hate to see it at the same time, we maximize our money with our nuts, get maximum money in. If, let's say, we create a range on the turn that either has nuts or has nothing, well, checking is the most stupid thing in the world we can be doing. We can find a good mix of bullshit hands and of nuts, and well, because we have those bullshit hands, we force villain to call a certain frequency. Well, if he overfalls, we make our money here. If he calls too much, we make our money here. And so this is how we can build things together. In most spots, we find the mix, right? In the end, but this is now actually we should read that that slide here from bottom to top and really think about that that way hey my nuts i don't care what i do i just want to get the maximum money and so i focus on part two and part three what do i want to do and then i use certain nuts to combine with part three into a batting range and i combine some nuts with part two to put into a checking range or a small batting range or whatever and this is then what gives you the mix where what you see is often in pylon we will get to that that some hands want to clearly do one thing checking weak top air wants to check some hands clearly want to be betting or well some some ear wants to check fold just right away it's just like the weakest stuff wants to check fold okay and lots of the nuts are often somewhat indifferent because and this is now how i understand it is well they don't care whether they get mixed up with this part or get mixed up with this part all right so let's see what's next now getting to a yeah a certain problem right now we are on the turn and we're coming back to the question hey how do we play now actually so now we have talked a little about the general thoughts about how our range is constructed and this is very very important Maybe try to remember the videos you have watched about the flop. I was never talking about my range. All the sizings just depended on Villain's range. And my explanation for that was that, hey, our range is always linear. We open raise on the button, big blind defense. Jack-9 deuce, I have top set, middle set, bottom set, all the straight draws. I have everything. I can choose any sizing. I find the hands that fit. And villain's range has those gaps. Remember the line graphs, maybe Walthig doesn't have queens, kings, aces, jacks, tens, ace, king. That leads to problems. Now, that's a very, very different scenario because our range is not really linear in most cases anymore. Depends on how we got into this spot. Villains, flop, c-bet sizing, our check-raise sizing, all that. But usually, our range is not really linear anymore. So we need to take into account how our range is structured. Is it more just part one and part three? Is it still somewhat linear and will lead to mixes and different sizings? Or is it just we always have a little something? So now it's the first time actually in a content session where we really need to talk about how do both ranges play? How can we attack villain? But does it make sense for us at the same time for the hands we are having? Because if we, in the end, if we end up just representing nothing, well, we probably have nothing, right? Or if we just represent one hand, we usually just have that one hand. So that's a big problem. All right. just reading the chat on the side so jerome is saying exploit don't the nuts want to get the money in on the turn by betting way more as exploit since most villains are checking back way too much after being check raised if that is true yes right but our nut question is only how do we get the maximum money in if on and that is true for lowest lower stakes if people are more call happy than they are bet happy and they are not bluffing correctly well then we obviously take control of the pot size ourselves and mainly work with betting but if people understand the game if you rise up yeah, the stakes, then there are some boards where actually you should, I'll have some examples probably. And yeah, let's get to those examples because this will just be way better to really explain stuff. All right. So I did not include that in the presentation. So actually I have my whole mentor on the side here and I have Pio on the side. So we'll just look at a couple of hands. I hope that is fine the way, yeah, that's full stream percent. So let's see, this is NL 1000 on PokerStars. Some Rack open raises on the button. If anything is unclear, I didn't try that beforehand with a, with a replayer here. Just, just let me know in the chat, but I just assume it's fine. We obviously defend our 5-deuce suited here. Flop is a nice, easy jack-9-deuce rainbow. Villain can use multiple sizings, mainly the small one. He can just build a wardrobe where he just bets full range with a small sizing. He can implement a bigger sizing that is built around like pocket queens ace jack and obviously all kinds of gut shots and draws as well here he ended up betting small you can't see that but actually the bet is 18 so it's like third pot and now we have the first decision if you are interested in how the check raising range looks like again check out the the other community coaching that is on the platform already the poker academy coaching everything is about that i'll just give you the quick rundown rundown that range that i will have here check raising is built around everything that has equity to to play for stacks right so that can be something like queen 10 king 10 10 8 10, 8, queen 8, 7, 8, 10, 7 with the backdoor flush draws. Obviously something like jack 9, pocket 9s if I don't 3-bet, pocket deuces, something like a 10-axe with a backdoor flush draw, something like a queen-axe with a backdoor flush draw, something like an ace-5 with a backdoor flush draw, but something like this here as well. The bottom pair that can make nice trips or a clean two pair, right? A two pair where villain is not improving to a straight a lot. So like hitting a five on the turn is pretty sweet with a backdoor flush draw. That's a nice one. So yeah, I check race here. We can talk about check race sizings here as well, but that's not the biggest deal here. Anything can be fine. This Thank you. nice one. So yeah, I check race here. We can talk about check race sizings here as well, but that's not the biggest deal here. Anything can be fine. This is a half pot sizing. 75% can be fine as well. Then you need to be a little more polarized, but okay. So I check race here and now we have the first spot. We get the seven of hearts. None of the flush draws gets there. Yeah. There's no added 10 8 gets there 7 8 7 10 now has a third peer and i have a question for you and that is where's the kahoot quiz here we go let's get to the next question i hope you have seen the spot so i did check raise versus a small sizing turn is that and now i want to know which is the main sizing we want to use on that board. Don't think about my 5-2 suited. Which is the main sizing you want to use with your range? Talking about the betting part of it now. And here you see as well the 2E, which just means a linear sizing. That would be like 120% pot here in that specific case. I know that was not much time, but okay. So we see the 75, we see the 2E sometimes, the 150, the 30. Let's just look it up and just, I'll try to get through that here. I think I have it somewhere and let's just go through it pretty quickly. Yeah. Again, you guys see we have cash game ranges. So we are freaking tight, right? Willem does see that high frequency, mainly small sizing. I offered her small sizing and a big sizing, whether it's 60, 75 or 30 or 25, doesn't matter for that case here. We can see right away a small bet range, but it will be fine as well. So against the small bet, we build our check raising range exactly the way I said. We see the offsuit gutshots here. We see some of that ace-jack-king-jack that is indifferent between check raising and check calling. We obviously see nutted hands like pocket deuces. We see that backdoor stuff I was talking about, some queen- suited, some 10 X suited with a backdoor straight plus backdoor flush. Those open enders here, like 10, eight, obviously, but as well, something like three dues, four dues, five dues with a backdoor flush draw. So that's all cool. I do check raise. Villain is only answering with a call pretty much. And we get the seven of hearts. And yeah, I didn't solve that to the highest accuracy because I didn't have infinite time here and my computer is not that strong. But what we see here is a good mix of things, but a clear favorite. And the clear favorite is this one here. We have $88 in the. And that's the 106, the 120%, something like that. That's the typical sizing there that represents the 2E. That will be another 120% on the river to get stacks in. And, you know, we can think about what is the reason for that. And yeah, we need to talk about evaluation of the turn card. How much does it improve us? How much does it improve Villain? So first of all, Villain here, cash game, doesn't have too much 10-8 off opening, just a little. So that's not that strong for him as making those trades compared to all the king-10 offsuit, queen-10 offsuit, king is something villain has full frequency the seven does not really improve to too many two peers so actually let's think about nuts that we check raised on the flop what is their goal now they want to go directional in that's still the plan they are still nuts then the next question do we have new nuts well 10-8 got there and we have not draw still something like king 10 is now a double gutter queen 10 was an open ender already we didn't add any of the flush draws so you see like that queen four clubs type of stuff is just all giving up and pretty much yeah that is already that's already our our answer here we have part three that is draws and we have part one and all that wants to go direction all in so that is our our main choice right and then we have a part that is the problem part right and this is just as i like i want to see it as again like our king jack is the part two what does it want to do it's like small bet is fine check is fine whatever right it's like it's a bluff catching game if we check and face bets and now let's see so we have figured out part three queen king 10 queen 10 king queen we have figured out part one, our nuts, ten eight, pocket deuces, jack nine. And what else have we figured out? Part two, ace jack, king jack, jack five suited, that type of stuff. So now what we need to do is finding the perfect fit. And that's, well, we build a batting range of part one and part three, nuts and ear. And that's pretty easy here because we have ear that has very, very good equity versus calling range, all nut draws. Cool. We put that together with juices, with the straight and some of the jack nine. And now this was another question in the very first round of questions. It's like how to use the lookalike principle, for example. Why do we have ace-jack, king-jack, jack-six suited if we don't forget to check raise that sometimes? And they pretty much mainly want to check. So which of the nuts is the perfect candidate to put in the same range? Well, it's like the jack-nine is a good one, right? We have that offsuit. That is a high frequency check. It looks like the ace jack and the king jack. So that's all cool. It blocks calling range with that nine anyways. So that's pretty much it. The main reason for using the big sizing is that, well, what are we trying to make indifferent in the end? And that is still something we beat with all our nuts. This is the reason why we want to make indifferent in the end and that is still something we beat with all our nuts this is the reason why we want to go all in we want to make indifferent villains jack x villains pocket queens pocket kings pocket aces i can just show you that if i bet here they all need to call again ace jack we are playing for 194 dollars right now and ace just like $9, $10 of EV. So that's almost indifferent so far. Let's say it calls and we face another brick on the river. Then when we are jamming, Aces are indifferent. Kings are indifferent. Queens are indifferent. And this is the big deal that, well, the turn card didn't change so much that means hey villain is like didn't improve to too many hands and we still can target this year let's see what do we have here in the chat what is 2e 2e is the linear sizing to use perfect direction or all in so what you can do if you use pile is what i did here that's a little small i guess but i just turn out of position i put in 2e and the solver does it for you and yeah knit game ranges yes so let's go back sorry for all the back and forth but yeah let's double check how i played the hand as well two's five suited i hope i knew that 2e is my main sizing here this is what i did that's pretty much yeah i used the 150 percent button that's a little cheating so something like 230 would be better but i guess that's okay and he calls river is the king of clubs so queen 10 gets there my king 10 my king queen improves to a top pair and well now we only have one choice and that's sticking the money in there and getting the fold we can just double check understanding all that right so when i review a hand like that it's about all the steps right on the turn in game i knew okay hey this is one where i mainly use that i think if i run it to higher accuracy it will be even more of that and yeah so i choose that villain is mainly answering by calling but he wants to raise some stuff because my queen 10 king 10 has so much equity so he raises those hands that he cannot fold anyways on the river disregarding the card but have the like have the clear value right now and so why are is our sevens raising well because they get it in against jack nine now but wouldn't get it in against jack nine on eight or a ten or a queen river potentially so this is well are people doing that i don't know call and then the river is let me see sorry i want to talk about my juice five on the turn we can do whatever it's a fine bluff so i went for it and on the king river king of clubs it's like the clearest fist pump jam in the world and you see even how much money it makes 26 dollars in in my pocket by jamming instead of giving up on that card would be interesting to see how it works on a full brick but still one of the better bluffs giving up something like queen 10 blocking all of villains folding range let me see feel free to ask any questions in the in the chat how do we decide what to do in game when we have a situation like this where five two suited is 50 check 50 big bet do you randomize no it just means that if villain is playing somewhat correctly it has the same eb but usually villain is not playing correctly so he is either over folding or not and or i want to be a little more aggressive or not because well let's say we have 50 of five dues and 50 of four dues here so now first of all you need to be sure that you raise both of those let's's say you forget to check raise four deuce suited. Then on the turn, if you do not have those, actually you will switch to 100% betting with this combo to get the right frequency somewhat. It is just important to understand, hey, this is not the perfect combo to be barreling. But a king 10, queen 10 pretty much always wants to barrel, but it's a good one. And then you make your decision based on assumptions. It's just, is he overfolding or not? I actually think about that stuff before. This is one of the favorite spots where I love over bluffing the turn, because this is where my experience says that people are overfolding. They make their decisions on the turn, not necessarily overfolding the river. So if the river was a three, I see myself giving up quite a lot, even though that was almost 100% jam with Pio. But the turn, yeah, it's like my experience, this is the overfolding spot where people, yeah, against the overbet, I mean, they should call all their queen tens, right? They can. People are folding that because it's freaking scary, right? Or whatever. Mainly people are calling their sets and not fast playing as well. So this kills your river fold equity. But yeah, to answer the question, that's pretty easy. Okay. Tom asks, on a 8-10 queen turn, is the turn size 75%? I didn't think overbet turn was a thing when straights come in. Very good thing. So we need to evaluate the turn card. And that depends on how many new nuts this villain creates, or way more, how much decrease our old nuts in value. If the turn is a queen, how strong is our is our jack nine still it's like do we want to go directional in with that still probably not so actually what happened is we lose some nuts but add to part two right to medium strong hands my jack nine wants to get to showdown maybe one more bet in so let's just have a look. I think that will be huge mixes because here I didn't solve to the highest accuracy for time reasons. But let's have a look at the queen. Let's get the queen of spades there. And what you see here is exactly what Tom says. Overbet doesn't exist. And if I keep running that sim here, this will go to a 0%. That is pretty clear. And what we see here as well is how do our nuts play. The queen is an awesome card for in position and we have lots of medium strong hands now. Actually if you think about it what is our air here now? We can even take the offsuit makes it easier easier. Offsuit. What is our air here? We don't have any. We have some 10-4 suited. Okay. Right? So, hmm. What do we have now? We have nuts. Obviously we have king 10. Obviously we have 10-8. But we have lots of jack 9 jack 9 queen 10 king queen all medium strong and us having all those hands gives villain incentive to fire on that villain can still have like ace king type of hands he has potential gloves he has ear so what we want to do here is mainly work with small bet sizes or checking why we don't need to go directional in this is the important thought my king 10 to stack a set i don't need to be betting so if i check here villain should invest quite a lot of money or if i let's say that's small there's even that clear raising range and in the end the money goes in with that with the nuts anyways right that's again kind of you can see that as in a way the dice principle do i need to do the job myself if i if i have king 10 i think about make sure to stack his freaking jacks and knights that's my goal right and to to achieve that well i don't need to overbet overbet now because then i'm pretty unbalanced and my checking range is fucked up and so this is something that probably leads to potential leaks that your villains are having if your villain is checking here he's probably not checking often enough with king 10 so way more he's just having queen 10 all-10 all the time or king-queen, and then you can hammer on him, pretty much even going for a bigger value than you could in theory with your ace-queen, with your king's aces, something like that. Going for it really thinly, getting the one more call from something like king-queen, queen-10, or even bluff him off to play for stacks because he's unprotected there right perfect mihur so anytime the turn favors heavily the imposition we downsize or check and the big size doesn't exist if we have hands that are interested in building that pot size there are other turns where we only have air or nuts then we check a lot and give up or go big but that's that's a few boards all that in between is sizing down how much do you consider blocking unblocking villains raising range when choosing very strong hands as small barrels on turns i think that is over like not a big deal on the turn think about the blockers on the river especially like with tight ranges if you have like that five deuce spot for example and you have it versus under the gun or like an earlier position where really sets matter more from a combo perspective having that set blocker to go all the way like that kind of blocker is more important or to have that well unblocked villain's folding range on the river that's way more important on turn, it's more about equity and the hand strength itself. Are the nuts going small on the turn, but we go polar on the river? So split river range into medium size and jam. Well, when we have like three and a half times pot left out of position, we probably won't jam. So think about villain has nuts himself in a scenario like that. So there is a game tree where he goes direction all in. That should include nuts and bluffs if he has bluffs, right? If he's never bluffing, we can exploit it like as an exploit size up ourselves. But I can just show you, we bet small here and get the full brick here. And yeah, there's definitely no all in, right? Because everything that we make indifferent, calling an all in, that should raise itself. It's like, if I jam here, I mean, his queen jack is indifferent. What can I do against queen jack if I want to get the maximum money against that? Well, I can block bet. And then, well, queen jack, bad example, but more of the sets, they should raise, right? My goal is to get the maximum money in. So this is where the dice principle helps a little. It's not necessary, right? To just go very, very crazy, right? We can size up a little or anything. That's fine. But it's really that the thought process of getting the maximum money in, and that's not necessarily by betting big. Okay. So let's the next example so we have seen something like that we have seen a brick actually not a brick turn we have seen the seven that's like a decent card we have seen the queen that is very good for in position let's check out a brick what happens here is pretty much the same thing like the seven as well just not adding that much equity and here we see a clear large sizing large sizing we're just clearly polarizing with nuts deuces deuce three jack nine is again the mix right think about the lookalike we want to check some of our jack x king jack queen jack so we take our strongest jack the jack nine as well and sometimes check jack that's tough and yeah take those hands with equity to barrel and what we see here is well we give up something like queen four suited that we should have check raised sometimes but we barrel something like ace three right because this has equity this has five outs to make the freaking nuts queen four has nothing and yeah this is pretty much again where we clearly have we split our range in a way hey we play part one and part three together with a big bet and we play part two and part three together as a check or a small betting range would be an option as well okay let's get to the next example i think which one was that let me double check this one here okay i think this is this is, this is, I guess an easy one. Let's see. Where is Holimentor here? Queen 7-4 I'm looking for here. This one. All right. Two and a half X from the cutoff. Ace-8 off is already close. Welcome all tournament players. We are freaking Nitz. Very good player. NL 5k plus playing as well. So here we're playing NL 3,000. We face that board, queen 7-4 with a flush draw. We have the backdoor, not flush draw. We have some kind of a backdoor straight draw. And we face not a small bet, but a half pot bet. Actually, I did not see that this morning. So I solved it for a small bet, which I think it doesn't really make sense to bet half pot on that board, given the 7- way better for for out of position and yeah half but i don't like that his bet size there but maybe he's just simplifying there in a way i don't know and i'm check raising this one here and face a turn card and again so the flush gets there five three and five eight gets there something gets there. Something like 4, 6, 7, 6 has a two pair now. Again, the question, what is your main bet size? Not here. Where's the Kahoot? Give me a second. Here we go. Next. Which is the main sizing we want to use on that queen 7, 4 with a flush draw where the straight card with a flush gets there on the turn? I hope everyone understood now what 2E means, the linear sizing direction all in. All right. So what we see here is a clear no overbet. We see some 2E. We see some 75. We see 30. And let's just have a look instead of just me telling you guys that's the wrong one queen 7-4 versus cutoff that's the one so yeah you see already i solved it again a small size which is 30 in that sim and a big size which is 75 and just how much payo chooses the bigger size tells me that his half pot is not really a thing. So let's pretend he did bet small and we build a betting range where ace eight with the ace of spades just is a hundred percent fist pump clear check raise. And yeah, a little rule of thumb theory is always you check raise some flush draws. So you need some of those offsuit ace of spades as well. And you always take the weakest one in your range, right? The straight connectivity helps here additionally, but just knowing the weakest ones in your range, and this is big line versus cutoff. I just know that I have some ace five, some ace eight, and I start having ace nine all the time. So ace eight and ace five are my offsuit ace of spades here this is this is created over time i know this is probably have to like have all those small golden rules to follow but this is definitely in our range and now we get the six of spades and congratulations to everyone who found the 30 percent button because well now we can think about why is that the case and one main thing i want you to think about always is really where is our advantage if i bet big it will come down to flushes if i go directional and do i have an advantage there not at all right so villain has as many flushes it's like low cards four six of spades, so villain has all the broad way and high flushes, ace high flush, he has all of that. So I don't have an advantage there. Where's my advantage? I have more four six. I have more seven six. I can check raise those. We can double check on that. Oh we have some four six, we have some seven six. I have eight five makes a straight. 5, 3 makes a straight. I have 5x. I have 8x. All those have equity, but they don't have equity if I bet big and villain pretty much continues with flushes all the time. My 8-x has good equity against his random pocket jacks without a spade or against his random king-queen. So I want to attack that part and not go directional and actually betting big makes it easy for villain here and now the the standard question i get here is but i want to get the money in with my nuts yes sure but what is stacking off against you if you have the nut flush or you will stack the king high flush don't right? It's like you should raise that at some point. If you block bet and block bet again, yeah, he should raise any flush actually, right? So don't really think, change that term. Think about where is your advantage? Think about how much part two, part one do you have? Which sizing is effective? And put the dice principle in there as well. It's not just betting. Your goal with the nuts is to get the maximum as well. It's not just betting. Your goal with the nuts is to get the maximum money in. Not doing that by betting. And yeah, if people are super passive, obviously we need to be betting. And now we see, I did not follow Pio and I was like, I have the freaking ace of spades, I go all in here, right? So I just went with a 75. I thought this is a thing here. It would be, I think if like the turn is a nine, for example, let's just Thank you. of spades i go all in here right so i just went with the 75 i thought this is a thing here it would be i think if like the turn is a nine for example let's just double check i didn't check on that this is just me guessing now yeah then then we have some of the bigger because then i don't have that extra advantage of straighty stuff i don't have five three and five eight so you see ace-8 is one of the first hands that actually wants to take the big sizing directional in. But that 6 is actually a big game changer, just giving me so many straights. And think about if I bet big here with my straight, for example. What do I do on the rubber? I don't have a big value bet anymore because villain has so many flushes. Here mean i played it this way the obvious way just going all in in a way with my ace of spades but it's it's actually not the way i should play it i mean it did work out here actually this is just a small turn bet and then a river check actually and then i have to put potential check jam if i want to but yeah something to learn from for sure not saying like usually the flush card means decrease sizing decrease sizing everyone has nuts so i need to find the point where i have the advantage and maybe to point that out once more is let's check this here the range explorer and we look at that graph on the bottom right. And what we see here is out of position equity is the green line, and in position equity is the red line. And now by choosing bet sizings, we decide which parts of our hands we are playing. If I go directional in, we are playing, and actually let's make it that way. Give me a second. Great paint. Get some paint skills in here. So this is the graph I want to look at. And what happens if we're playing with big sizes? We are deciding to play top 10% versus, that didn't work out, top 10% versus top 10%. And now I can ask you, hey, I don't see the advantage where like green is not really better than red here. That's like the same thing. We both have the flushes. If I say, hey, I'm not betting, I'm checking. What happens? Well, we play full range versus full range, which, well, I could now make the big rectangle, but actually that just means that the bottom part is included here as well. And here I have no advantage either. If I'm checking, well, I'm keeping bottom 30, 50% in there as well. What do I really want to achieve is I want to like tackle this part. But I want to find a point where I can like reveal and fold some of that stuff, but needs to continue with this. And this will come down to me winning more often at showdown because I have the clear advantages here. This is where I talk about the straight 5-3, there for sure seven six four six in there for sure the sets i did check raise on the flop in there 100 this is where my advantage is on that certain board now this is why i changed it now one time to the nine of spades to just to just show you hey that is less of a straight advantage so it's not that necessary to to use that small sizing to target villain Thank you. just, to just show you, Hey, that is less of a straight advantage. So it's not that necessary to use that small sizing to target the one. All right. I hope that helped a little as an explanation. And this is really a nice graph to look at. And I think I haven't, I haven't seen more clear graphs than that one so far. That's very nice. It's it's like when you see other ones, we have one more example, I guess. Well's pull out the jack-nine-deuce again. Just have a look at the jack-nine-deuce again that we had before. Just show that as well, how it looks there. We had a check, a small bet, check raise, call. We had a seven of hearts on the turn. And here we see the overbet. And now let's have a look at the range explorer. Where is the advantage here? I don't paint now, but actually it's more in that upper area here where the advantage is, like here. That is all the jack nines. Here is all the jack nines. That is our advantage here. So we want to more tackle this with normal bet sizes, like 75%. We're tackling that part. Small bet sizes seem to not make any sense, right? Then we force Willem to continue like with his top 70, 80%. That does not really help us. All right. So let's see. What's the next one? I need to double check my list here. Oh, we have one more. Okay. 8, 8, 5. Where is an 8? I'm looking for an 8, 8, 5 board here. Here we have it. Okay. NL 500 this time. Defending big blind versus cutoff against a very good drag. I think we can check. We can 3-bet that sometimes as well. Board 8, 8, 5. So that board is very interesting because now what I talked about before in the general thoughts, we can apply that right away on the flop. Here, we don't have much part two. We don't have hands that are interesting in getting to showdown cheaply. And this is why that is a very, very high frequency check raise board. I'm getting lost. This is where we can play like 25% check raise strategy because we are not interested in calling too much. We don't have a mid-peer plus something. We have a 5x, we have an 8x, we have a straight draw, or we are full of shit. So this is why something like that is just always check-raise, always, always. And then same question as before. I did check-raise. We turn here, flush draw, but our hand doesn't matter. And my question is what's our favorite sizing here? And I don't want to make it a trick question. It is multiple sizings here that we can use. So try to find the ones that are used like frequently. Yeah. Let's start the Kahoot here. Multi-select. Okay. Which is the main sizing we want to use on 885. Turn bringing a flush draw all right so now the big question is obviously why right why are pretty much all the selections are okay right that would be a little different so here here we are facing the cutoff. The cutoff actually has still quite some 8x. If it was like 775, 665, it would be way more of the bigger sizes because our advantage is around that 8. But let's just check it out. 885. So first villain, we see, is it cutoff? cut off yeah it's kind of can still see but very high frequency because he has quite some he has ace eight offsuit so he's all the suited eight x that's still still some eight x and now we see like the 25 check raise or 24 i was talking about something like 9 10 of diamonds just pretty much always being in there not many hands that are really natural calls like obviously something like ace queen ace jack but these are all low ev hands like the three dollars we make here by calling is not changing the world and so what what happens now that we check raise that wide here well first of all we give villain trap like villains offsuit trouble, that's great. But now, what does that mean by us check-raising a very, very high frequency, like very, very wide range? We have, in the end, kind of a linear range, which is interesting, right? We have eight acts. We have something like pocket sevens, pocket nines, pocket sixes. We have the boat. But we have some of the fours threes deuces as well we have the backdoor straight draws we have just like random over cards with the backdoor flush draw plus backdoor straight draw something like ace four of something it's just a very very wild mix and that brings us to the turn that is more or less a brick it adds a's it. Ace-4, ace-3 now has a gutter. But it's like not that interesting. And now what we see here is we have a wide range. Villain has a wide range. And everything makes sense. There are no clear advantages. I think that goes a little more away from the overbet sizing. If I keep running it, I guess that was really not, that's okay. But we see like it's really whatever because we still have all range parts and Villain still has all range parts. With no gaps, there's nothing to attack really. It's just a very big sizing. I cut that a little away, even though it is still 6%, just makes it too easy. And then like you can only do that with an eight and villain has enough eights and in the end so it's like okay it doesn't really is this the best option we're working with small right something villain needs to call all ace highs so why not betting small again with something like pocket sevens totally fine right using a normal big bet size with something like ace four why why not, right? It's like, really, there's not a clear advantage. And now I didn't look that up before, but I expect that range explorer to just look like a very linear function, right? Just both of them being very close together all the way. Right, so we see here, yeah, it's like whatever, right? They are actually like out of position has like some advantage around the eight acts after check raising but in position has is like protected in that way and yeah so it really it makes sense to target that small part here but that is really tough right that's like one very very specific thing and getting there is like by betting small and getting raised or by whatever it's not necessarily the just the all-in because villainous is heavily protected and in between there's not a clear part that we want to be attacked so that's whatever right so let's just look at the hand how it played out and it's yeah one more thing that it's just it's important to accept when things do not matter too much but actually i made a mistake here i did over bet and i don't like it my thought process i remember that hand in game was clearly to fold out better draws because against that bet size he cannot call with like a queen high flush draw but he doesn't have them if i have like a four six of diamonds i'm fine with that but the only queen high he's having is like queen 10 and queen 9 pretty much and ace high flush draws are not folding and king high not necessarily either so it's just by me having that 9 10 i'm just really blocking the hands i try to follow and now what's happening i'm I'm just getting called by Ace-I and King-I flush draws and by hands that have me beat. So it's like really bad stuff happening here for me. I should rather bet small here or something normal to attack his Ace-Queen, Ace-King, whatever. So yeah, I ended up getting there, but I do not like how I played that hand. All right. So these were the few questions I prepared there regarding that. So let's just, I have a couple of more hands that I want to hand. All right. So these were the few questions I prepared there regarding that. So let's just, I have a couple of more hands that I want to talk through with you and we can just put into use what we've talked about so far this year, this year, this year, this year. And okay. And maybe I think I should have one more slide here to share with you guys. And where did the presentation go here? Okay. So maybe going through the spot one more time before looking at the last examples, we want to know our check raising range. That's our baseline. That is so important that we have an idea of what we are doing here. Then the turn card falls. We want to evaluate that. What I mean with evaluating is we want to know how many new nuts does it give to us how much medium part do we add and how does it look with a nut advantage what that means is how many of our old nuts are not nuts anymore or rephrasing that how many nuts did villain improve to i remember the jack nine on jack nine deuce. Turn is a queen. Sure, I have new nuts with 10-8 and king 10, but my jack nine is not strong anymore. So that decreased in value because villain has all that. So from the other poker academy coaching, the queen 5-6 versus under the gun was my example there. We do check raise and there we have beautiful things where the three, for example, adds new nuts, but the old nuts are still nuts because under the gun does not improve on a three. So my two peers are still freaking nuts, but I have straights added. And that was something where we can overbet our full range on the turn pretty much. Okay, this is what I mean with evaluating the turn card. This needs good knowledge of your range and hopefully some knowledge of villain's range as well. Then looking at that, we can come up with our sizing plan. We build our wardrobe and that's it pretty much. What makes sense? We need to have like two clear things in mind how do we continue with the one part which is medium strong hands and nuts that we want to check or bet small just like get to showdown in a way because they work for each other if villain wants to attack that he donates into our nuts if he does not want to that, well, our medium showdown value hands are very, very happy. And the other part that we need to put together is the air we are having and the other part of our nuts that we want to play aggressively. And then, well, last point is just execution as always, I guess. So yeah, let's try to do that for some of the the last examples'm having here and oh we see his hand already that's not good not a good sign but okay we defend six four suited here that's a little similar to the jack nine deuce i would say and i do check raise here as well this one i mean it's not the perfect board to go crazy with check raises because villain does not have a chance to c-bet too wide. If he can or is allowed to bet full range, he cannot oversee that. So I would rather like that to be some kind of jack-7-4, right? Where he's not allowed to c-bet full range. So I'm not really making... I just play like a little pio-like and do not exploit anything here, really. I turn a flush draw. I have a set blocker with a four. That's pretty clear. We are slightly deep. I'm definitely using the two E sizing here, which is a little larger because we are that deep. He ends up calling. We get the suboptimal run out here and get it in. But pretty, pretty standard hand. We're like, let's talk about the turn evaluation the seven is a full brick i improved to some seven four maybe he has two combinations of nine seven suited maybe yeah we still have all the the gut shots queen jack jack 10 queen 10 that's it my old nuts are still nuts i don't have any new nuts. So nothing changed. What do I do? I take my best draws that I continue with, like some ace five of diamonds, something like this here sometimes. And I bet most of my nuts. And yeah, the ones, what am I checking is pretty much like the jack nine deuce example. I check some of my king nine to protect my king five of hearts of hearts. I'm sometimes check-raising. Some other king-x, like my king-queen, king-jack, I'm sometimes check-raising. And that should do the job. All right. Pretty easy one. Let's go to the next one. I defend ace-9 offsuit against the cutoff. Villain c-bet small here again. And this is one of those where we don't have like really, we don't have the plan to play for stacks pretty much. Obviously we have five outs, but we can do so. But we want to deny lots of his equity. He can have king-jack offsuit, queen-10 offsuit, all that stuff. So check raising, it's pretty much like check calling, but having fold equity. This is how I see it. And that gives us logic to just keep, like start the turn with checking very, very frequently. The six, I do have some sixes, but the six does not improve any of my draws really. I have some six X and yeah, my draws actually decrease in value because I'm not drawing to nuts anymore with my straight draws, but it's pretty much a brick as well. And yeah, I think I can, I have some big bets here. I can block bet that as well to target some kind of ACE high, but mainly I will be checking. And then it's like after check calling. That's why this is why I called it on the flop check calling with fold equity. I plan it as if I had check called before. Now he's betting small. I have fist pump snap call. Actually raising is an option as well. And the river juice is not the best card. He bets that and his ace nine would be a value bet. And this is just what we need to call. Hoping for him having like some kinds of jack 10, queen 10 random bluffs. But that's totally fine. So we both played that hand totally fine totally pio confirmed yeah let's see this one ace 10 suited versus ace 5 offsuit now he uses a big sizing so this is obviously fits very well to his hand and here i made a mistake i told you before that i always start with the weakest offsuit ace-axe that I have to put in my check-raising range. But if you remember how we think about facing c-bets and how to continue, there were two steps as well. First, building our defending range. Second, splitting that up into calls and check-raises. I started with a second step here without even thinking about the first step. He sizes up a lot. That means I need to fold a lot. Sure, my hand is somewhat okay, but against a big bet, this is just a fold. And I was like, just thinking, okay, I have my, like probably before his bet, I look at the flop. It's like ace of spades, five backdoor, like one of my weakest aces, backdoor straight draw, backdoor nut flush draw, awesome. And then not reacting to the big bet. So my hand is just a fold. I obviously end up check raising and this is a perfect turn for me. See how I use the 2e sizing now, which is now not 120% pot, but it is about pot because flop sizing was big. 8-9 got there, 4-5 got there, 6-7, I can have that. I have more of the straight draws. That's all cool. So totally fine to go with pot here quite often. Planning to make all his overpairs indifferent at some point, all his top pairs. And yeah, River with the ace of spades. That's one of the first give-ups, unfortunately ups unfortunately if you're three-handed here is this one of your worst aces well a three has a peer i have ace four off as well and ace deuce off is a solver fold in reality i have it but then it's like ace deuce ace four ace five is like the same the kicker will never play and then i prefer ace four or ace- just for the for the straight draw so it's like when i say the worst aces you don't need the difference whether it's ace five or ace twos right whether like that does just doesn't matter the kicker will never play so that's all one okay cool yeah pretty easy i think nice hand from from both of us just me not seeing the bigger flop size or not reacting to it, which is not good. Pocket fives. Defending, flopping a set. So far, so good. Facing a big c-bet from a very good drag. I think he makes very nice zoom 500 videos, but this sizing does not exist in real world. Like this is exploitative versus the pool. Like I give him pocket tens here right away that's just this sizing does not exist big on that board we can all run the sim middle position versus big blind does not exist so out in tournament it exists with shorter stacks yes i think deeper not really and maybe because big blind is even way wider i mean this in the cash game world definitely does not exist. I don't have like offsuit garbage. So yeah, now he, by betting bigger, he polarizes right away, but he says he has something strong or not. And this is when I use a bigger race size as well. And he calls turn is a very bad card. And we've learned what we need to do on those very bad cards we've had small and right one third is totally fine uh this is the here i sometimes i have a 25 hotkey sometimes i have a 30 so that's small size is fine the exact size is really does not matter and the river is as bad as it can get and i guess this is just our check fold unfortunately but okay that happens okay one last very interesting hand and this was the one i referred to when i said we'll probably get to see it when to like when to check nuts as well so here villain again very interesting see that's big on that board here it is is totally a thing, but with his hand, it's a little unnatural. And yeah, I size up top two. I can sometimes call. I should most of the time raise. And the turn, I boom, turn the super freaking super nuts. So the biggest mistake I can be doing here now is to overbet. Because I'm blocking his 9x, his calling range. And I don't want something like Jack 10 or a Queen 10 or a Queen Jack ever to fold. That would be a big problem, right? Hands that are drawing to some nutted hands, but actually in this case, they are second nuts. So actually this is most of the time we're pretty clear Pio check. I think I ended up betting small, which does not really make sense. So I guess that that is not the nicest line. This is just a pretty clear check. This is not achieving too much. Like which hand do I want to do that with? Some ace nine. Yes, some frequency, it will be fine. But not like one of the major lines. I prefer to check here. And okay, I just run another eight. That's okay. Right. But a really interesting, just to think about that. I think that was now very fast. All the quick rundowns rewatch that think that his turn race against the block bed is a thing. Definitely. Yes. Maybe I have it here. Even let us check. Let's take that as, I mean, it's last hand anyways. So I think I solved that one. I i don't remember anymore here let's see i don't want to lie here so i only offered him the big bet because he used that so a seven eight suited if we only offer a big bet it's definitely a thing eight nine can be a call most of the time a race as i said and the turn was which eight eight of diamonds calls eight of diamonds and now what we see here is that's just the worst card in the world for us because it kills lots of our nine eight combinations it decreases the well value of all our draws and this is what I actually said in the opening question to one of the answers as well well if we need to accept it when the card is very bad for us so we should check the majority of our range and eight nine we see like some the americans call the trace play right when you can see some traces of like in piyo that it's like okay to do something that's just the clearest check of all times so i have to blame you for that and yeah and so we just lost all of our advantage on that on that stupid turn and we should check but if we bet small him raising here is totally fine right he should always start with a better eight axe but yeah so he raises then my call is fine and then a river was a king guess. Then he can jam any eight, I guess. So yeah, that's totally fine. Where is our advantage on the turn? On that turn, there's not a real advantage anymore, I guess. Here, out of position. We're just losing so many combinations of like, because another eight appears and we have so much air, like all our draws not it's not only that our draws did not get there it's just that they decreased in value because boats are possible now as well okay let's wrap that up with i guess the last slide summary right so very important in which way ever does not matter too much but have your own, for a thought process. I want you to have a thought process. I gave you mine more or less, right. Talk to you through some examples to showcase that a little. And yeah, then really important for me is that understanding next, that it's not about the nuts. Don't think about the nuts too much, right? It's not nuts need to be a bet. That's the best play. Most of the time on lower stakes, yes. But I want you to understand why. Weak and medium strong hands actually give incentives. And they should tell us because of that how we want to play, mainly with our range. Because the only goal of our nuts is to get the maximum money in the middle. If that is by betting, do so. Go ahead. If it's okay to leave our medium strong hands alone, perfect. If villain has the incentive to bet but he is not doing it, well, we over-realize equity and we still get called when we bet with our nuts totally fine and always think about remember that little range explorer less than there where is our advantage do i try to get to that direction all in because we have our advantage here or is it somewhere in between let's remember the queen 7 4 6 with a flush example both players have flushes but we have the straights and the two peers and there was more like in between so we want to use small sizings to Thank you. Six, with a flush example. Both players have flushes, but we have the straights and the two pairs. And there was more like in between. So we want to use small sizings to tackle that part, to make use of like villain being lost with his top pairs, with his kings, with his aces, not having all those two pairs and straights. All right, that's it. Again, longer than expected, but that's, I guess, the standard. And yeah, now I was on vacation for all. So before like all the videos of the last weeks, I had to record them before. Now I'm fresh again. Give me some time to come up with the next videos. And then I think end of next week, I will have something done for the next upload. Until then, feel free to make a thread as well in the CashGam content section to discuss that even more. Put hands, especially of that topic in the CashGam hands analysis. And then see you around, guys. And yeah, enjoyed the session. I hope you did too. And yeah, as always, I think I opened up something in the feedback thread. It's always trying to make sessions better. Leave some feedback there, positive, negative, constructive, whatever. Just stay in touch there and see you in the Slack community, I guess. Kahoot results. It was not a fight. That was, but okay, I can show it. Kahoot results. So John, you missed most of it. Yes, you will be able to watch the recording. Give us two days or something like that. So very, very close fight there for gold. That's the, I guess, but for everyone right now, these weeks, it's all about the Olympic spirit, right? We need to go for gold. Yeah, so do that on the tables as well. Enjoy your day, guys. Bye-bye.
