### TOPIC: cash postflop double barrel
 All right, hello. I'll give some more time for the Kahoot, but we can start with the presentation and see a little what we will be discussing today. So I call that betting big and polar. That's obviously a super, super wide topic because we can do that in all kinds of situations. I didn't write that down, but I'm just focusing on the very, very basic one, which is the single raise pot in position where not even every every board but where we see that with quite a high frequency on the flop and then it's like the turn decision where we need to decide okay which sizings to use which hands to bet that's the goal for today we won't be talking three bad pots we won't be talking blind versus blind out of position that's all different stuff where obviously we can apply parts of that that we are talking about today as well, right? Just like building polarized betting ranges. Why do we do that? When do we do that? Et cetera. But for today, I want to really cut it down to the most simple spot because it's just, it's about the concept, right? It's not like I cannot tell you or give you a gazillion zimps and then you know how to play all that so we will start off with a few examples of i just browsed the the hands of my last two weeks pretty much and have looked for some of those spots that do fit because that's the beauty of it when we just talk concepts and not too specific stuff you can be sure it will you will be in one of those situations next week, next session, next whatever, next time you play. That's the good thing. And it's not like some super constructed situation that, well, maybe you face it next month. That wouldn't be too good when it comes to learning. So first, some examples to get an idea what we are actually talking about. And then we are looking at the situation really step by step. What is happening? It's like what is happening on the flop? What does that mean for the ranges? What is the situation on the turn? Then we will focus first on when to use which sizing? What does that actually mean? What are we doing by choosing a certain sizing? Then I will help you a little to break things down, which maybe if you've been in some more of my coachings or even have watched the Poker Code Academy stuff, then you know that I'm a big fan of divide and conquer, which just means take a problem, cut it down into smaller pieces, and then it's actually a small problem that we can work with. So this is what I want to do here as well. It won't be just like, barrel the turn or not it will be divided by what's the reasons to bet a turn or why should i bet this hand or that hand are there certain categories and just by having that more in-depth knowledge what we want to be looking for it's way easier to remember it's not just it's just way easier to to think about okay do, does that fit into this reasoning for betting or into this instead of just sitting there and like, oh, it's okay to bet or not. So I'll give a little image. And this is, I can tell that already kind of that we are the boss, right? And we are just like giving jobs away and all those hands have some jobs and some hands are just made for a certain job. And some are not just like us humans are right it's like i'm not made for heavy lifting maybe i should work on that but i don't like it so you better let me solve some puzzles on the desk probably then there are some other people who are just like made for heavy lifting right so it's like it's the same with our hands and then there are some people who can just do anything right then we'll have those So it's like, it's the same with our hands. And then there are some people who can just do anything, right? Then we'll have those mixes. It's like what, which kind of job you give them, they will do a good job anyways. So then we will look into some PIO examples to just get a little more into praxis. And I'll have lots of questions there. Have like a short, short discussion about thought, like exploitive thoughts and approaches. And then to summarize it all up all up that's the goal for today and let's get started right now i guess 22 in kahoot that's fine so 36 in here make sure 14 of you who did not show up in kahoot yet it's your last chance once we start in one minute it's over so i'm just reading through the chat here cool don't get confused i just like have this sugar here and i love it so yeah i have to eat all the time oh 23 still people jumping into kahoot leaving again coming back okay that's weird but okay let's start examples this one we have king ten suited i'll just leave you through the hand right so i played it's whatever stakes, I guess. NL 500. I open raise 2.5x on the button. We are 100 big blinds deep. Some wreck, I guess, defense. Flop is 9-8 deuce rainbow. I decide to play that with a very high frequency c-bet. And I decide in that spot to only go half pot. So it's, yeah, we could talk about different flop sizes. There could be different game plans that make sense as well. This one is definitely fine. So just to give you, this was my thought process in that hand. This is what I do. And now we turn a flush draw. So we have six outs to make a top here. We have a second nut flush draw. We are still kind of deep. There's $53 in the middle. This guy checks to us. And yeah, now the question is pretty much, what am I doing here? So let's start that Kahoot here. And that actually is not the first question because I always mess it up with Kahoot. And just forget that hand for a second. And we'll start with a little brainstorm. And just you tell me, you take a minute and think about what do you think about when you hear double barrel right i forgot that as i always do kind of a nice pattern it's just what pretty much what do you expect from that coaching what do you think i just want to want to gather some thoughts and then we'll probably come up with all those throughout the coaching. And then we really get started with the hand. That's the next question. Pretty sure. So just whatever comes up in your mind, whatever you think about here, let me know beforehand right now. And then I can maybe put that somewhere into, into the whole coaching session. Don't be shy. Seven answers so far. I need at least 15. Okay. 22 answers, 23, 24. Here we go. Let's just read through that pretty quickly and see. Sorting the ideas. No, I don't need to sort the ideas. So I don't need a voting. So let's see. Turn C bet over bet size. Okay. Not advantage. We're talking about not advantage. Okay, great. Betting through on the turn. Just the definition of double barrel. Okay. okay board structure when do we can make a lot of pressure slash equity nice one of those words you can always write down there putting pressure making opponent fold a better hand talking about fold equity barrel king 10 of spades right that will be on this hand i will barrel for sure it will just be about the sizing taking an aggressive line polarized which means either top or bottom of range probably not over betting too many mid pairs betting big but only with part of range when over cards only fold versus big okay that seems really really specific splitting range so what you did here is actually like just describing what what is like what double barrel means or what polarized betting means. Right. So actually what I want to hear like is your thoughts. What do you think about, right? It's like, I have a decision to double barrel. I think about nut advantage is a great thing, right? It's like maybe another very good answer would have been like nut advantage over time, right? Looking ahead, what can happen on the river? Which situations can come up? Who will be the one that improves to maybe straight draws, to straights, to more to flushes, to whatever? That's like, okay. And then when we think about that, I think about, okay, which sizing to use? On this specific turn, how to split up my ranges with those hands that, does it fit in a polarized betting range? Or i want to check back making that clear cut one thing i think about when i hear when i think about double barreling all the time is the value threshold it's like something what i mean with that is the weakest hand that i want to barrel here for value for sure pretty much with the plan of like keep going on the river so it's it's lots of things right you gave lots of definitions or or what you understand what that means but okay right all that will be in the coaching and now we can actually keep going with that hand and yeah king 10 suited you've seen it for those who just joined a second ago we are again open raising on the button big blind defense i decide to bet half pot And this is my only sizing on the flop in that situation. And I can tell you already that maybe I can't. No, I did. So that I will be betting this turn. Might be a check as well. And I'm asking you which sizing did I use, right? Not what is correct. I ask you just guess what I'm doing there. And we are not looking for the voting. And this is now where it starts. What did I do? You just have 10 seconds. I did either bet 30% or I did bet 75% or I did bet 150% or I just made a fool out of myself and I did still check. Okay. So 13 times we got the 150. And yeah, I didn't copy that without it to just show you. So you have to believe me and i did bet 150 percent right now we'll get to understand the reasons a little more right why not 75 percent why not what why not i mean maybe even 200 i don't know right i play that turn actually with overbet only and maybe at the end of the coaching you all can tell me why and yeah let's get to the next one second hand is ace five of clubs again we open raise the button it's a three-handed rag war on stars on in a 1k big blind defense i see that again small not again this time i see that small on that board of king nine seven rainbow which i do guess, almost my entire range. The reg defense checks to me on the turn on a four of hearts, and I will be betting. So again, same question. What am I doing? Well, this time you get even points here. That's nice. So yes, what did I do with my ace, five of clubs here? Again, did I check, which apparently was not possible since I did bet, bet 30, bet 75, or bet 150. Okay. So again, I did bet 150%, and maybe you can think about the reasons already, right? It's like, it seems not that clear. Lots of you wanted to bet 75%, but actually I can tell you, this is another board where I'm betting only one sizing, and my sizing is 150%. Yeah, maybe we'll learn about why or why not, or maybe I did something wrong, but let's see. So next hand, sample number three. This time I have pocket queens and flop a top set. So this time I'm in the cutoff, shouldn't change too much. Big blind defense. It's again, kind of a rag war, I guess. Guy defense. Yeah, I see that small on that flop of queen eight six rainbow that guy called turn is the seven offsuit and now I do bet again and same question for you which sizing did I go for always the same offer here I like to stick to my known sizings okay again we see lots of I call that betting, like my 75%, whether that is 66, 80, 75, doesn't matter in the end, or my 150, or even the 30. Here, I chose the 75. And I can tell you guys, again, actually, I play that turn. I like simplifications a lot. The only sizing I'm using on this turn is the 75% sizing. I'm never overbetting there and I'm never betting 30%. I do sometimes check but never with pocket queens. So maybe think about it already okay what is actually different compared to the other boards. Okay next one hand number four and that's the last example hand. Is queen 10 suited? So I'm okay let's let's raise the stakes where they respect my raises. Cut off. I open raise on NL 5k. This is on GG. So we don't see screen names. I cannot tell you whether that was a fish or a rag. I don't know. I open raise. He defends. Flop is ace queen 4. Very good board for me. I can play that on the flop with multiple options. I can either bet small with almost my entire range, or I can split my range and have a big bet and a checking range. It's both fine. I decided to go with a high frequency c-bet. Thank you. small with almost my entire range, but I can split my range and have a big bet and a checking range. It's both fine. I decided to go with a high frequency c-bet and I do turn two pair. So next question, which sizing do I go for on the turn here hitting my what I did is the check. And if you would double check that in PIO, it is I'm sure of that a very, very high frequency check. Sometimes it can be a 75%, but, but, but the overbet is not really a thing on that board right so we can already i don't want to dig too deep why that is i mean we'll get to that but how strong is villain on that turn and actually he improves to quite a lot of stuff so does overbetting make a lot of sense into a very strong range right here my queen 10 why i check that back is it's actually not a very good three street hand it's like yeah villain has better two peers villain has straights etc so it's more like okay i play my queen 10 the same way i play my queen x and my 10x and i snap call them off on the river or have on bricks a value race and it's just all right some patterns that come from from like going through that pile stuff so this was kind of the trick, seeing some checking happening. Okay. So this was a little to dive into the topic and I'm happy that not every one of you guys nailed all the answers and that means we can learn something from the next stuff. So let's see what's next. Okay. Let's just keep going here. Yeah. I want to define the situation a little. What do we know what happened? All right. So we know that it sounds super stupid, but really I want to go break it down step by step. What happens is we see that the flop, which I said, I'm choosing spots where I see that very high frequency. So I do that with a lot of hands, right? We have seen my queen 10 on ace queen four. We have seen my, which a random mid pair. We have seen the top set. We we have seen my ace five on king nine seven which is a random ace high with a backdoor straight draw idiot straight draw plus a did it have a backdoor flush draw i don't remember even i had that king 10 on nine eights it's like right it's like all kinds of stuff so what happens next villain decides to call right if he doesn't call we don't get into that second barrel spot so we force him to call now which mainly means that he did not raise which is very very very interesting right he did not raise this is the main information that we get from his move because when he folds i mean this is information as well but the hand is over so he does not raise what does it mean for his range probably something and then we have the next step which is actually the next point of information that we need to evaluate is a turn in peers. It would be a different thing on that ace queen four if the turn is not a 10, right? I wouldn't have a two pair. So probably your answers would be different and all of you would have checked back. But yeah, this is just, it sounds super stupid, but it really helps to think about, okay, what will be the case? How do ranges look like and how to approach the spot? And again, I will do that by asking you some questions, right? So really think about what happens, even if it sounds stupid. And what does that mean for certain ranges? Because now, so I read in the chat from Cedars, he is helping all you guys already. He caps his range, right? He would raise his strongest hands. Very obvious, but this is what happens on certain boards. Sometimes maybe villain slow plays. We don't know. So if turn is a blank, we can polar a lot. There's lots, lots, lots. It sounds very easy, but there is lots of knowledge in that. So next question will be about ranges. And so Silas crushing it here so far, right? Let's try to catch him and give good answers. And the next one is here. You can take Sila's answer because it's a really good one. How does our range look like is the first question. Our range in position. How does it look like after betting high frequency on the flop? Think about this step by step. I'm not asking about the turn. Turn card doesn't play a role. How is our range after betting the flop? Okay, so unfortunately, no one went for the cool range. I think our range will always be pretty cool, but it is cool because it is a linear range, right? A polarized range is what we will build on the turn most of the time, right? Once we see that high frequency, our range will always be linear. That's the good thing. Linear just means we have all parts of that range that can exist. We will have air. We will have weak showdown value. We will have weak draws. We will have medium showdown value. We will have medium strong draws. We will have strong showdown value. We will have something nutted, right? Maybe there are some spots where we cannot have the nuts, right? When like 4-7 suited makes a straight and no one but Johanna open raises that, then it's okay, right? But still, the structure of our range stays linear in a way, right? So the little hint here was queen 10, I mean, we had a mid-peer here, right? So it's like, it cannot be like more linear. I mean, in a polarized range, there's probably not a mid-peer. So yeah, condensed, it's not at all. So linear is the very, very clear and only correct answer here, given that range situation. So now the other question, right? It's like, okay, how does villain's range look like? I mean, here we go. I guess most of you got that right. Silas somehow didn't get it right. Okay, let's go. How does villain's range range look like after calling versus high frequency bet on the flop? Which means, again, we do not care about the turn card. Just he clicks the call button. This situation, how does his range look like? Okay, so most of you nailing it, right? Linear would mean it has all parts, but it definitely does not, right? Maybe with lower frequency, but mainly his strongest part will be raising. And even more though, his weakest part will be folding. So after calling that bet, villain shouldn't have full trash, right? It's like after calling on ace, king, jack, villain will not have something like five, six of hearts, which actually to make a range linear, we need that. It will definitely not be polarized after calling right which would mean like what does he do with like medium strong stuff polarized just means okay he does not have medium strong stuff but that doesn't fit condensed is just pretty much the inverted of polarized so it's missing missing air, but always has like a little something, which is exactly what is happening when we are calling. So this is maybe some people haven't heard that definition of like condensed. It sounds weird, but it's actually, yeah, just top and bottom is missing and everything in the middle left is like condensed together, whatever. So most of you nailed that that's good good. And yeah, let's see. I just want to visualize that a little to show that. And I have a, I don't want to go too much into detail because that would cost us a whole coaching session, how I'm thinking about ranges, how to visualize that. But I guess you'll get it very, very easily. So I skipped one and now first we're approaching the spot. So I missed that slide here. And I had to laugh a lot when reading that comment from Johanna. So I guess you are here. So shout out to you. Finally, I will make them fold on our bullshit and call when I got it, which is exactly a very, very exploitative approach, which we will maybe talk a little about that in the end, but that's not our main goal. So my approach always is all range driven, right? It's like, we think about our whole range and have to make the best decisions. And we don't care about villain. I'm not sitting there and I don't try to make him fold. I don't try to like, whatever, right? It's like, so so far when we were talking about ranges and next we will talk about sizings probably. I won't be talking about my hand even. So I won't be looking at my hand. And this is like a good tool for you as well to really think like, forget your hand in that situation. Try to evaluate the situation first. Whether I have top set or I have nothing, I don't care. I will come up, I want to come up with a strategy that I want to allow myself. And next step then is look at my hand Thank you. first. Whether I have top set or I have nothing, I don't care. I want to come up with a strategy that I want to allow myself. And next step then is look at my hand and put it into the right options that I gave myself before. If I sat on the flop, for example, I'm playing that board with a range bet. Well, I don't even have to look at my hand because I only gave myself one option. So I choose that option. If I say, okay, I played with a big bet and a check. Well next step i look at my hand and i have to choose does that fit into big bet or does it fit into check right but before before i open those those like boxes where i put hands in well before that is done i don't need my hand so here this is the approach i want to discuss today is range driven i want want to maximize the view of my whole range, which works first step. I figure out the sizing that we want to use. And then I figure out maybe multiple sizes, who knows. And then I figure out how to structure all hands that we have in our range, which goes into check back, which goes into one size and which goes into other sizing. And then we look for reasons. Maybe we're not thinking about, okay, I try to make him fold now maybe he turned two pair then he won't fold right we cannot and we cannot influence that but i can think like i know certain hand categories for example if villain is a thinking player and i see that on king jack five and i bet big on a turn juice he will fold 10 10, nine. So some stuff we know, and then it's like about, well, which hands do we want to bet? Which hands want him to fold 10, nine, which others maybe want to keep him in. So this is, this is the goal in now coming to the range visualization. And this year, don't be too confused. What I did here is a step-by-step thing. And as I said, I don't want to go too much into detail, these are pretty much just line graphs right most of us have done that in like first grade when we learned numbers from 1 to 20 to see like okay where's the 13 on that line graph oh it's on the right side of the 12 and on the left side of the 14 that is just like okay it represents this is like how i imagine ranges look like post flop is just like right side is stronger left side is weaker right so you see on the left side villains range and on the right side heroes range so let's and then from top to bottom we go like step by step what happens first thing we see a flop and that means okay, hero will always have a linear range. We open raised a linear range. We see a flop. We will have top set, mid set, bottom set. We will have top pairs, mid pairs, bottom pairs. We will have air, whatever. It's like we have nuts, we have nothing. Right side nuts, left side nothing. Left side is not totally correct because villain did not call a linear range. Willem did not call aces preflop. He did not call kings preflop. He did not call queens preflop. Big blind versus button. Deep, right? So this is probably missing. But on most boards, he has some two pairs. He has some sets. He has whatever if the earth is straight. So there might be some gaps, but more or less his range is in a way linear. Okay. So next thing happens. We see that high frequency, which happens somewhere here in between and then villain calls. So, and that was just the last question that you answered. Our range stays exactly the same, right? Because I mean, if we see that almost everything, or we see that everything of our range that looks like that in the top, right? Then it obviously still looks like that. But what happens on the left side? Once villain calls, well, I just killed some of the lines on the right side, which means, okay, some of his nuts are not in his calling range anymore because he check raises. And all his trash, all the left side is missing now as well. So yeah, he got rid of his trash. So his range is now, this is exactly what I mean with that condensed. And then we have the next step, which is what we are getting to now. The turn card. And this is what we need to freaking evaluate now. How much does it change something? Actually, when we look first again on the right side, the turn card, can it change something for us? We started preflop with the linear range. We have a linear range on the flop. We see that's still a linear range. It's tough to change the turn in a way that we won't have a linear range anymore. It's like sometimes, okay, maybe 10, 6, 2, 6, where people are donking in a way. It can make sense because we have less of those mid-pairs. So we have some kind of stuff missing there. But actually when we see that everything, we still have that. Maybe there are some gaps happening, but overall, we still have a linear range. It might be a little weaker or a little stronger, but we are not missing significant parts. On the left side, this is what we need to focus on. And this is the first learning effect for today. When we look, when we think about the turn, we should always in this situation think way, way, way, way, way more about villain. Our range does not care. I can pick hands out of my range that want to play a big bet. I can choose hands that just want to play a small bet because I have a big pool of hands. I have everything. Villain doesn't. So my goal is to choose sizings that hurt him the most. So there is a question. If you're out of position, do you range check turn cards after c cards after c betting which improve in position player or split between small sizing and check for example flush draw incoming if villain has more flushes yes that's a tough question but not the topic of today so i want to skip that a little it's like it depends right so it's like first thing is okay big bets are not allowed for me anymore because villain can react too easily and then i have to decide actually there's not big a difference between a small bet out of position and a check because it's still villain's turn after that it's just the amount of money so it's actually not a big difference what you do and then sometimes the simplification to range check is okay sometimes the small bet is very very favorable in a way for you when you have advantages in other areas right when the flush is good for him but actually the top peers and stuff is maybe better for you and you want to keep full equity so i want to just like answer that that quickly and keep going with our in position spot today because i like focusing on those i call that money making spots right money making spots is when we have all advantages not advantage equity advantageal advantage. And when we look at those ranges here, this is exactly what we are having. So now next step is evaluation of the turn card, where it's our main job to evaluate how many new nuts does villain get like as a present from the turn card pretty much. So we could get, I could go the example hands right actually let's just do that just think about those what happens here i see that half pot pern is a three with very very wide ranges and we are cash game ranges no anti so not like 60 johanna and not like 80 defense no we are folders cash game players are folders because there is no money in the middle that we can win. So Willem does not have... Okay, he improves to pocket threes. He might have deuce three, eight three, nine three suited, but it's close. He definitely never has three deuce off, eight three off, nine three off. So that's a good thing. No straights, no flushes, no nothing. So my tens are still are still nuts queens are still nuts ace nine is still nuts everything is kind of still nuts so it's like villain did not improve at all so his range is like as condensed as it can get and i don't care about his freaking three combinations of sets of threes right so it's like cool pretty good big sizing because i have that big advantage i can pressure him i don't know it's the question okay what does big sizing mean especially important for you guys because you don't always play 100 bigs so big sizing for 60 bigs can be a different sizing than a big sizing for 300 bigs or 400 bigs because it's just well we want to use the power we have and. And what I mean with power is just our chips. That is the maximum pressure we can put on. And this is sometimes, like sometimes I can jam 10 times pot on the river. Right? With certain hands when there are certain runouts. It's like there's one thing that MTT players like doing a lot. It's like they play their game like they always play 40 BB. And whatever they have more than that, they play pretty much like an optional rebuy. It's like, okay, they really use their 40 BB and they don't touch the other stuff. Just when they lose the 40, they reload that to keep playing with 40, which is bullshit, right? When you have an advantage, go to the maximum, right? If you are not all in in that situation with your freaking pocket threes on the river, it's your mistake, right? This is one of the biggest mistakes I'm seeing when I'm coaching. Like when there are certain situations, I know it's like, let's call it a cooler or not, right? But I'm winning with a full hundred bigs here. And some of my students just win 40 in the exact same situation, which is just kind of ridiculous, right? It's like, when you have the advantage, go with it. Let's say other spot, when there's a queen on the river and I'm the only one who can have jack-10, same spot. But today it's about turn. Okay. So this is villain does not improve at all. So overbet makes a lot of sense. And I don't want to say overbet actually, because it's like when we are just playing 40 bigs, it's just a bet direction all in, which allows me to size up for River Plate spot what happens here hmm turn four in cash games trust me given ranges villains should not have king four off not seven four off not nine four off maybe he calls pocket force on the flop maybe not seven four suited okay you should have it king four suited both two or three combinations nine four suited close so it's like as good as it can get pretty much no straight no flush no nothing so again same option we can overbet that's like we can put max maximum pressure we have sevens we have fours we have nines we have king nine we have king seven we have nine seven we have aces we have ace king well it doesn't have all those, ace-king, because not pre-flop, and the others, I mean, never say never, but he should check-raise high-frequency sevens, high-frequency nines, if he doesn't three-bet, and high-frequency king-nine, and very high-frequency nine-seven. So this is just, yeah, ace-five is a pretty sweet overcard. Yeah, that's for sure. So yeah, good stuff happening here, but it allows me to use that sizing. Next spot, very, very, very different. I can tell you already, overbet not allowed, not possible for me here, right? Because Willem does improve to 4-5 suited, 4 straights. Even in cash game, we sometimes defend 4-5 offsuit, right? I only made it 2.2x. So it's like, hmm, 4-5 offsuit might be 12 combinations of straights. five suited another four combinations nine ten offsuit you hear the offsuit it hurts me right it's like 12 combinations nine ten suited potent like maybe sometimes three betting maybe sometimes check raising flop okay it's not like rocket science now to to nail the combos but just like the potential new nuts, big, big, big trouble. So that tells you already, okay, your Kings cannot overbet and then bet again. It's just not strong enough. The one proves to a problem that Queen seven offsuit, but Queen seven suited, maybe seven, eight offsuit. Very big difference. Offsuit two pair or suited two pair, six, seven offsuit. So here I know, and I'm not looking at my hand still. I look at the situation and i just like click a little back and forth i look at those red lines here how often did villain improve with his range and this is my evaluation process and here fuck he did improve to a lot of freaking nuts right so i cannot when i bet big i force villain to only defend a few hands which is something nutted so i make his life. So here it's not like everything gets there and he has it all the time. So I can still bet a normal size. But yeah, I'm definitely not betting bigger than my 75% size. Next thing, pretty much same thing. Willen improves to freaking 16 combinations of King-Jack. 12 offsuit, 4 potentially suited if he didn't 3-bet. He improves improves to nine combinations of ace 10 suited and offsuit he improves to queen 10 offsuit that's like where was my advantage my advantage was having ace king that he doesn't have it's like how big of that advantage is it still when villain has lots of strong two pairs now even having nut straight that is even better than my the sets i'm having and he doesn't have So it's like a big big big problem whenever that is the case overbetting not allowed every overbet into his strong part is a donation into his nuts so it's not allowed right and you can see it in a way poker like it's a it's a way directional in and you're both navigating your ranges into that directional in and it's the big hands making the money in the end and when you are the only one making the nuts it's your job to go all the way right you have to like put the signal out on the left side and like go on the take the german motorway and go fast right that's the goal like you it's your job to get directionall in if both of you have nuts well you share the job right you have king jack and you want to go directional and but actually villain has king jack as well so he partly should go directional and and that means always size down but let villain help you right because for every bet he should be or every race he should be doing with his king jack he should have bluffs which then gives your value part ev as well so here next spot big bet not allowed and queen 10 just like is a better check most of the time which hands should we keep betting on the turn here well king jack mainly queen stands for us even like something like more vulnerable like ace jack ace king is just like those hands that prefer a little more to get the it's like we i'm evaluating how much value do i have left and do i rather take that now or take it later and the queen 10 is just a fine one to check it back because it's kind of a look-alike thing right when i have queen x i'm checking when i have 10x i'm checking so i want to be checking when i have queen 10 as well when it's it doesn't help me to bet now get i mean the one street that i get from his ace, I get later anyways. It's like, I don't need it now. I don't have two streets. So this is just the thing. Okay, back to the ranges though. So now you see what I did in those examples to just evaluate pretty much what you see here represented as red lines. And this is the only thing that matters because your range, and this is so important to understand, always looks the same. Just always. So the only thing is villain's range. And yeah, let's see what's next. I forgot totally. I just, it's always, I make that presentation the morning before and I always forget. So, oh, right. So that was now the first step, sizing. Allow sizing yourself. There would be some very, very, very special occasions where we even want to size down, like using a 30% double barrel, which is when everything gets there. Let's say there's an offsuit straight getting there, plus a flush getting there. So I've made a small list, like how important things is. So this is just pretty much summarizing a little. What I keep talking about here is we want to mainly focus on how much did villainain's range improve and we want to look on key cards. I just did the example with those example hands. What did I look out for? Nuts, just nuts. When does Villain make a lot of new nuts? When there is a flush coming. Villain calls every flush draw on the flop. Or definitely not folding, maybe he's raising some. But this is just freaking lots of nut lots of nut combos for villain so for me it's not okay to bet big anymore on the turn villain can improve to offsuit straights offsuit straights are always freaking nuts and offsuit is freaking lots of combinations villain can make offsuit two peers right it's such a big difference when you know whether it's like okay villain defends like king nine plus here and let's say it's like what should i come up with like it's like king deuce three it's very very different whether the turn is a nine or a seven it's just very very different just because the amount of nuts that villain just added that's and then it's like okay it's like i'm always one of those guys crying it's like okay after overbetting he always has two pair plus but it's my job to find out how often does he have those two pairs that's suited straights okay and then we get to that stuff that actually are bricks right villain improves to just the set or just suited two pairs that's like okay we cannot there is no joker brick card in the deck he will always improve to something but this is as brick as it can get and the less nuts villain has in his range it allows us bigger sizings as i said every bet that i'm doing is a donation into villains nuts so when he has no nuts i'm not donating at all and i can go big as big as i want if he has all nuts in the world i'm a big donator which is great in other cases but not at the poker table okay and with the set of queens anytime turn, no too much equity against us, but maybe in other spots, that's a good idea, right? Taking blockers into account. Okay. Well, I'll, I am not answering all questions now, but maybe we'll get to that later. If you are, is the sizing important? I mean, I tried to talk about that. If we overbet, is the sizing important? We could go a lot deeper there. It's just important that you set up the option for the river. It's usually what I do is I set a value threshold, which I mean, what I Thank you. important. We could go a lot deeper there. It's just important that you set up the option for the river. It's usually what I do is I set a value threshold, which I mean, what I mean with that is really the weakest hand I want to go directional in with. And if I said, let's say King 10 deuce turn is a three, my value threshold is like around King Jack, King Queen. And I start checking King nine for sure. And before that, like against some people, I can go three streets with king jack because they three bet king queen all the time villains or with some against some others i need king queen something like that and then i need to set it up if you play 60 big steep your turn sizing should be smaller than when you play 100 big steep sometimes you have thinner value bets as well and you benefit more from keeping your range together instead of having multiple sizings let's say villain cannot have a set but you have lots of hands that you want to bet for thin belt let's say we have something like nine five deuce and turn is a queen villain could have this queen but you still want to value bet your ace nine so you cannot go like 150 with ace nine now it doesn't make sense but you want to go direction in a way when you have like pocket fives that set that you can never have so there it might be an idea to either keep your range together to just play one range on the turn and then split crazy on the river and go berserk direction all in or you split on the turn and say like okay maybe you take your ace nine in the smaller sizing you take your pocket fives in the bigger sizing to balance your smaller sizing that Willem cannot check raise his king queen there. Then you put like some stronger hands with blocking effects in there, like pocket queens would be the first idea, maybe even pocket knights. So stuff like that, but this is just something you can do the pile work, but it's important to understand what are our incentives. Our incentives is to use our advantage and to use our full chip stack as possible. So very big difference, whether we have 40, 60, 150 picks. Here it's not, I cannot tell you use 150. That's my standard turn sizing, pretty much 400 big blinds. It allows me like a two and a half times pot river jam and that fits kind of nicely. So yeah, important and really try, do that in your next review, right? Evaluate the turn card and say like, okay, villain improved to this amount of freaking nuts, right? Offsuit two pairs, offsuit straights, flushes, et cetera. Okay. Next step. Now it's about splitting up. And I have like an image in their mind, right? I said before, you are the boss and you have like different kinds of workers. So the other thing I have like, okay, you're the manager of a a team and yeah so you're a freaking team manager and it's your job to navigate all your hands in the right right way it's like you have a super squad but right it's like we want to maximize the success of the team right if you're a freaking bad manager and you put up manuel neuer as a striker and let messy play in the defense or as a goalie that sucks sucks, right? If you have like little stupid workers like the minions, like your 5-6 off to nothing, nothing, maybe they can still get away with something, right? Give them the best job they can do, right? Don't give them the most like, no, triple barrel all in to go crazy, right? So this is just like the image I want to have in mind. And it's again coming back to Johanna's quote, which is like super nice. And I'm pretty sure that she didn't mean it that way, but it's the first instinct that everyone has like, okay, I want to know, I make, I want to make him fold. I want to make him call. I want to build my range in a way that in the end, like all the small edges, I want him to call when I, I want to bluff against him and still have a little percentage equity against his calling range to then value bet that again when I hit it, even if it's like just two outs, right? Where I want to check back when I actually dominate his folding range, we will get to that. And then, well, if I hit my hand, which can be, let's say three outer to a second pair, and I navigated my ranges in a way that actually villain improves very often to a little worse second pair. This is where the value is coming from, right? So yeah, this is kind of the image and keep that in mind. And now to stay in that image, we want to go next to like talk about which positions do we need, right? Here it's not about striker, defender, and goalie. Here it will be about, okay, which kind of parts do we need for our turn barreling range? So first to loosen that up a little, I just have a very, very private, important question there. There's no correct, right? But let's get that poll done here. I want to know what your favorite team manager is out of the four that I chose. If you don't know anyone, just click on Jurgen Klopp and you are right. I got to know the audience a little better here. Okay, that's strong. So very, very German community here, it seems like. I could live with all of them, actually. So let's go next. And keep that in mind, every hand has its it's our and we are the manager of all those hands so we need to tell them which job they should do some people some workers are okay with doing multiple jobs right it's like uh tough to come up with those football comparisons but there's like Joshua Kim he can play like all kinds of stuff okay let's see oh maybe there was one more question I want to ask another open question for for you guys. So think about that. And this is just a quote I write there. Pants to double barrel should at best case have. What should they have, right? You think of something, your best first idea. Give it a shot. No right, no wrong. 21. Let's guess how many equities we see here but okay so should have not advantage okay our range should have not advantage right so now we are talking about hands can a hand have not advantage a hand can be good or bad but like actually only ranges can have not advantage right a hand cannot have not advantage life out okay all right what does it mean with life it's like in a way okay change is really something i even like call it sometimes like good equity and bad equity or like having equity is always good against the calling range but it's even better when we hit our hand and can still value that some equity equity equity blockers to value hands of villain unblocking folds so here we are talking about now equity and fold equity right we can influence even like how often villain will fold probably outs to improve equity kind of nut advantage we talked about that perceived budget range always helps fire fire for the win additional equity nut potential i guess blockers or equity okay equity orers. Okay. So this is exactly the answers I was guessing. Fake blockers to bluff rivers with. Very good one. So talking about different jobs, right? We have something there already. So first thing that every one of you know, but just like by seeing your answers, I guess that it's not that clear in your head because the more precise you can be in those spots, the better you are probably as a player as well. So what I wrote down there is that equity always has two reference points. What I mean with that is you cannot have equity. It's not possible. Equity always is something against something. And whenever you use the term equity next time, please use it as equity against. Against what do you want to? I mean, it's very clear, but you could always say pocket jacks have good equity on queen jack six with a flush draw. But actually they don't have good equity against pocket queens at all. Now I could say ace jack has good equity on queen queen-5-4 if I just put a full big blind defense range as the opponent's range in there. If I think about barreling, well, I'm more focused onto what is villain continuing with. So it's all like queen-x, two peers, other peers, and then actually the ace-jack equity really sucks. Now let's say we even think about triple barreling. Then, well, whatever we have in equity against 7x, 6x doesn't matter anymore. And then it would be okay. What would be a good hand to have equity? It's like, well, 7-8 is probably pretty cool, right? Because it's not equity, which means, okay, even equity against the strongest of all of villain's parts. So this is a little reminder for you guys. Always talk about equity with two reference points. You have some equity against something. Do you want to have equity against villain's turn calling range? Or do you want to have equity against his call turn and then call river range? Which would be even better, right? Because it means you can still value bet when you hit something. If you have equity against his turn folding range, then you probably shouldn't be betting, right? But you could still say, I have equity, whatever. What does it mean? So yeah. So we want to have equity versus certain hands, given the lines we choose. And this is just by thinking about that, it often helps us just like, okay, choose those lines, right? Which position should that messy hand here play? It looks like a great striker to go all the way. So see what's next. Okay, now I made a little, I split that up a little and gave those jobs some names. And actually to do that, I want to, it is now coming to Pio examples to have some kind of idea what we are talking about here to get a little more to the praxis of it. So I hope this is big enough that you can see it all all and the spot i chose is just king 10 deuce rainbow it's button versus big blind i can just quickly show you this is a cash gamers button range yes we fold offsuit aces on the button sometimes but we do have all pockets okay so we're still kind of cool right it's not like we're missing pocket deuces here out of position high rake no anti defending range yes big blind is folding offsuit aces as well and big blind is sometimes folding like those offsuit bullshit there as well right the other stuff that is missing are all three bats so yeah just to have a quick idea don't try to remember that now it's just to have a quick idea so what we do there on that king 10 do sport is okay we have better hands now and we will have better hands over time because we have all that broadway bullshit and i only offered a small sizing just means we attack villain's bullshit that he still has i can almost bet range or let's say we are betting range villain is sometimes raising but we don't do that now because well he is raising his stronger hands so he ends up with this yeah he's ending up with all that green which is his exact condensed range we were talking about so he was calling and the turn which was the turn i chose was actually here five of diamonds was the turn i chose which means brick as brick as it can get is there a flush that got there no offsuit. Offsuit straight? No. Offsuit two pair? Double check? Nope. No king five offsuit, right? So is there... Okay suited two pair. King five suited, ten five suited, and pocket five. That's like... But it cannot get better than that. So let's have a look. Villain checks. There is no donking. And well, which sizings do we choose? This is 30% never happening. 75% can sometimes be happening. I'm not playing that. I simplify. I only use one size and I polarize. Okay. Don't try to memorize that too much because I'll ask a couple of questions. And the first one here is the first category I will be talking about is value all the way. The easiest one, right? So let's get back to that equity with two reference points, or think about what are the requirements, right? If I, let's say we're looking for the perfect person for a job, right? We're looking for the striker now. Requirement should score goals probably, right? So the requirement for our value all the way is we want to have high equity versus river calling range so yeah let's have a look now or let's guess now i just offered some of those hands and you just click on it so i hope it's very clear what i mean we are looking we have king 10 deuce i leave that open king 10 deuce with a five diamonds turn and or you can memorize that so which ones do fit that category this is the question now 10 deuce, turn is a five that brings a flush draw. Which fits the probably going all the way value category? So the options here is act quickly, you only have a couple of seconds. There might be multiple answers here so maybe you need to speed up a little. But okay, right? Obviously, mid-set pocket aces do the job. King six is good for one more street. It's now the question, should we take that street now or later? Ace 10 is probably, yeah, maybe one more street, it's close, right? So definitely doesn't fit the value all the way category, right? So it's like here, high equity versus river calling range. Let's just double check that quickly in PIO, right? Pocket aces, always betting. Pocket 10s, always betting for that reason. King six, never betting. Ace 10, never betting. So for other reasons, right? They have maybe one more street in value, but then it's the question, do they want to take that now or not? And then when we think about betting, it is always, there are two sides, right? It's like equity against calling range and equity versus folding range. Let's guess villain's folding range. Do we want those hands to be folded? Do I kill my potential coolers, right? If I, or do I gain something, right? It's like betting king six and villain fold, often folded 0%. He sometimes folded a peer, which had five outs probably. So we fold 10%, which is a little success. Maybe villain folded ace-axe, right? That is like three outs. So we folded out 6% where, well, this is very, very different when we get to boards that are lower, right? Just folding out over cards is already a success. And so here on those, the higher the board cards are, the more when you you just have two streets you just check and take it on the river right there's like no equity to be denied right even worse stuff like potential coolers let's say when we bet big here well william is folding ace nine and ace eight and even ace jack it's like how bad is that like i mean villain is falling the 10x just imagine you bet your ace 10 now will unfold jack 10, but the river would have been a 10. Well, then, yeah, Messi was playing goalie. Not cool, right? So it's like that would have been messed up in a way. So this is the first category. And I want you to remember those. This is the easiest one, right? We have freaking value and try to get the money in. I mean, this is what we do all day in tournaments anyways. So yeah, let's get to the next category. Next category, I gave the name equity bluff. Requirement is we have a potential value bet on the river. Actually, if we rephrase that, it's the same requirement as the value hand. We need equity versus river calling range. And this is important. It's not against what Willem calls on the turn. No, it is about what Willem calls on the turn and will call on the river. So we have another great river value bet. And this is why we can overbet here and go so crazy because the river will be good for us. There will be sometimes an ace on the river. We are the only ones having straights then. Or a queen, or a jack, or a nine. Same thing. Or a three, or a four. And we can already count that in, right? So this is just something which is part of our advantage already. So now think about that equity bluff. Again, four hands, zero, or no, it's like one, up to four of them are correct and fit into that category same i hope you can remember the board king 10 deuce and the flush draw 5 on the turn and just which hands do fit into that category equity bluff okay so we got the queen jack as the very, very obvious one. I hope almost everyone got that right. Nine, eight of clubs has nothing against nothing. It's not a flush draw. It's a little tricky that this is blue here because it was a diamond flush draw, but nine, eight of clubs is dead when called. Ace, four has a nut gut shot. That's pretty decent, right? The three outer to an ace is not necessarily having equity against river calling range, but it's decent. I let that one count. And the ace ten of diamonds is an equity bomb, obviously. Having a flush, nut flush draw and a ten, but it's not a bluff at all. So this is what fits into that category. And now we already have like two parts that fit kind of together, right? It's like, okay, we have nuts, we have nut draws. This is the very, very easy categories. And those are the bluffs that everyone finds. And let's have that look at Pio again, right? So we have 10 aces in our first category. Now we have Queen Jack, very high frequency, fits perfectly in there. Doesn't mean it's necessarily always betting because Queen Jack is one of those joshua kimmich guys right they they can do multiple jobs and actually this is a six outer to a mid pier as well right so if i over bet what happens villain folds queen nine and jack nine that's not cool for my queen jack not at all a villain folds all kinds of 10x that's pretty cool for me but checking back to in a way like have keep keep like queen nine jack nine in there hit your six outer to a to a second pier and cooler those hands for a small pot that's pretty decent as well right so it's this is where that mix comes from but eight nine of clubs is apparently not betting has no equity no nothing against calling range and what was the other option ace ten of diamonds it's okay because it has like equity like hell but it's not a bluff at all so yeah let's get to the next category i call that the potential river bluff so now i'm looking for fold equity actually and i'm again talking about river fold equity and right that means okay we need good blocker effects to maximize our river fold equity or let's say potential obviously it depends on the river maybe you can find some there right so let me just how do i i mean you have to remember the board it's show it one more time remember the board maybe suits matter king of clubs ten of spades deuce five diamonds and let's get to the next one Thank you. the next one. Okay, so we got the queen jack, right? We got the ace jack sometimes. We got the ace six. We got the queen jack right we got ace jack sometimes we got the ace six we got the pocket jacks so no one fell for the trap that's good obviously pocket jacks are not a bluff but you could think like if the straight comes here you have the super great super blockers with your pocket jacks which in the end is actually bullshit because we don't need to block hands that villain can never have right if the river is an ace villain won't have queen jack i mean pio is probably calling low frequency on the turn but yeah we don't need to block something that villain is never having even it's like a cool lookalike thing right if our hand if we value bet queen jack it's cool to play jacks the same way somehow but this would be a total waste so queen jack obviously is a potential river bluff but it's a one. It's like not one that is planning that on the turn, right? Queen jack was already in the equity bluff. It's like, I mean, I wouldn't say it's necessarily super wrong here, but it doesn't fit my category here. Ace jack, kind of same thing. Obviously it will sometimes be a river bluff when there's like other stuff getting there, but it's a super random one, right? And won't be a super cool one that makes money ace six is kind of a very very clear thing in the correct answer here because it just prepares for diamonds it's like okay if you're betting flush draws and straight draws and only that equity shit then well what will you bluff if those draws get there but if straights gets there you always have missed straight draws at the same time that somewhat look alike if If like queen jack, if ace jack gets there, then jack nine gets there as well. And something else misses, right? Your ace four and ace three misses, right? And all that, I mean, that's just straight draws how they work. If the flush gets there, ah, fuck, right? You sometimes have a nut flush, but what else do you have? A missed straight draw that contains one diamond, but not the ace. So having something like this is pretty cool. And here here the lowest ace is the best one i didn't want ace three ace four we had already in the equity bluff so this is the next lowest ace random offsuit ace that has no equity on the turn against i mean against river calling range now and this is something we see here it's just preparing right this is the the other one let's see we'll have another one. So five of diamonds. Checking what we see here is you see those low aces and this is something I talked already about as well. Think about calling range here. It's like ace six with the ace of diamonds is just a very very important bet and there are lots of people who are not doing that because they see they have jack nine, they have queen jack, bet their Ace-Queen, they bet their Ace-3, Ace-4, but Ace-6 seems like random to them. But actually, this is just so important. And it's super tough to actually over-bluff here if you only take those equity bluffs. Right? Ace-7 with the Ace of Diamonds, same thing. Where again, you could be there with the Ace-9 where you see the difference. The hand works the same way, but you see that like ace nine actually does still okay in checking back a seven does clearly better in betting and when we think about that it's like where does that come from it's like now you would need to dig deeper into cash game ranges which is not your goal at all but just for understanding if i bet big now this is what willan is supposed to And this is the big difference. And this is now what I mean with all the tiny jobs. If I bet here and I river my ace, I don't get coolered by ace eight and ace nine because I folded it out. So I realized those 6% equity in the best way possible, just playing against all those kings. And if I check back my ace nine wall and my ace jack, I check back and then an ace, it's no no luck like it's it's I know I hit it three out of whatever is left like three out of 45 times or something so yeah then I still have value because villain villain has his freaking ace nine and ace eight and I get to get a healthy street of value in being on the good end right then everyone knows that crying oh he always has that one pit better he has ace 10 when I have ace nine and the other way around but they are often there are reasons for that right because you structured your range a little more correctly than villain and this ends up like this is summing up that kind of stuff and understanding that right having some patterns okay those random offsuit aces start with the lowest one other good stuff happens so this is what i meant with that category okay let's get to the next one i guess that's a very tough one here because it does not really exist, but I still want to show you. Next one is the turn bluff, where we know this is just a freaking turn bluff, but almost never a river bluff. So requirement for that would be, we need good blocking effects to maximize turn fold equity. And even better if we have additionally equity versus turn calling range, right? We are not, we don't care about this river calling range because we know already we are not bluffing the river with that specific hand. So let's see. I think I came up even with four here. There's, I guess, not a really, really answer, but maybe we find one what is closest to that. So we're looking for a hand that we are bluffing on the turn, not bluffing the river and this is all our our turn strategy already all right so i fooled you there a little all of yours are kind of correct as well. The pocket sixes are not. But actually ace six is the one here as well because we have a very, very clear plan. We are bluffing on the ace when there's a diamond on the river. When there is no diamond, which is 80% of the time, we are never ever bluffing that because we have the worst potential blockers ever. We are just blocking folding range, right? So it's like, a trick question okay i have to admit but yeah we can let's have a look right so we bet our we've looked at that on the turn we bet our a6 with the ace of diamonds villain calls turn river is the freaking nine of diamonds flushes there a6 is obviously betting right it's a it's like not a zero ev bluff it's just it's making money so take a random card, the eight of hearts. Oh, a six is the clearest no bluff of all times, right? We are still sometimes winning against a random queen high flush draw villain might be having or a monster draw that he didn't check raise. So like slight EV, but definitely very, very bad blockery effects. But because if we are betting, the villain is folding all those suited diamonds and yeah, making sure he does not have them is just killing it for us. So actually this works for both categories, just like understanding what our plan is, right? It's not just, okay, I follow through on diamonds at the same time. I will never bluff anything else. And here, six, seven of hearts, we see those kinds of hands in other areas when there's like more floats to unblock in a way, right? So 6-7 is not the worst here. If we look, let's have a look at that again. Like we are unblocking just turn folding range. Queen-jack, jack-9, queen-9, all that kind of stuff. Even I made it hearts, right? That, okay, we are unblocking the backdoor flush draws from the flop. Let's have a look at the flop again. Villain is calling a7 of spades, a7 of7 of clubs when we have six seven of hearts he will have all those hands so he will fold them on all turns pretty much right so would be if i if i make it the five of hearts we will have a very very high frequency here with that seven six of hearts i thought but okay it's still decent it's not the perfect board for that yeah but this this category will be more important when we have less obvious bluffs like equity bluffs but then we we cannot here we have the wheel aces we have all that jack nine offsuit type of stuff but in others in other other board structures we need more kind of random bluffs where we need to look for those categories it's like okay my plan is i'm just blocking all his turn folding range all those let's say something like 10 7 deuce turn 3 whatever and i'm just i'm not having a jack not a 9 not an 8 not a 6 which is all his random gutshot bullshit and he will fold that and on the river i know already i don't have good blocker effects or anything so this would be one one more category and now the last one is now not about betting. It is the turn check back. I think I mentioned that one already. It's the turn check back with the goal of calling later or bluffing later, right? So the requirement actually, I could rephrase that and say like, okay, have like whatever equity against his check, check, and then whatever range. But actually I'm looking at his folding range because all the hands I'm checking back are those that are interested in keeping villains range keeping villains folding range in right so i mentioned that already that uh yeah on this if i have queen jack it's not too bad actually because villa i keep jack nine and queen nine in and i hope i didn't offer queen jack now because i think i make that as if there is queen jack in the next one don't click on it because i think think I made it wrong, even though it is not really wrong. But know what I mean? Just like those hands that want to make sure to keep certain hands in. And this is not what we are looking for. Okay, so this is the ACE9, which we pretty much talked about right keeping ace eight a seven a six in having the it's six percent it's a three outer or if villain has an ace as well it's just two outs but i mean four percent is not nothing and we'll have a small cooler on our our side king six we talked about that one totally right it's well what are we folding out that we i mean all those hands have like maybe a gut shot but maybe they have a six outer to a second pair where maybe we get one more street from pocket kings could be an idea here but it's just too dry right it's like we are blocking calling range but it's not like villain is just calling king x in that spot in other spots top set can be a check back because there's like nothing good happening. But here, actually, when we bet pocket Kings and Villain folds something like Queen-Jack or Jack-9 or Queen-9, it's not too bad for us, right? It's not like, yeah, pocket threes are actually a hand that are obviously checking back, but not with the goal of like calling or bluffing later. It's like just the goal of getting to showdown now and win against deuce x and ace high so that does not really fit that category okay so these were the five categories i wanted to show you and this was now we will do the same thing one more time maybe a little quicker and then there will often be mixes of those as well it's like just i want to like to take from today's lesson it's really that divide and conquer think about what is your actual goal with that hand's not to make him fold. It's to make him fold certain hands and make him call other hands that you have equity against. Think of those two reference points. Okay, let's get to the next sim I prepared with a couple of questions. It's an A-side board, so not 100% frequency, but still we c-bet often. I chose A7-5, which I only c-bet with a small sizing. We are again button versus big blind. I show you the flop c-betting range. We are checking all of those, not all of those, but lots of those offsuit broadways that dominate Willan's folding range. We bet our strong ace-ace-x, and we bet everything that is around that straight-t stuff that might be interesting, not wise in a way. So Willan again is forced to call, so that means he does not have a lot of cards a lot of strong hands and now we again get a card that is pretty much the best in the deck for us the king of hearts so i made offsuit this time and now we can go through okay what happens what does villain improve to flush no offsuit straight no offsuit two pair well no king seven does not exist here in the cash game world ace king he doesn't have so nothing we again he only hits like suited two pairs that's it okay king of hearts it is even like a quick glance only over betting again right now i could offer multiple sizings right depending on on like stack death that might even be like 180 percent or something like that but this is something that i that i simplified and there's not too much EV to be gained. It's just to understand the structure. Why are we putting so much pressure on villain now on those certain cards? Just to show you if something is a little different, just make it the 10 of hearts, right? Where villain improves to more two pairs. It's still overbetting. Obviously two pair doesn't kill it for us, right? But it starts adding this a little and it's less betting here, right? So maybe let's make it the nine. Actually, it looks like villain has straights, but in reality, he's check raising all his six, eight suited. So not really, but he has ace, nine offsuit. And does he have nine, seven? No, actually, I make it an eight. To have like eight, seven and ace, eight offsuit to see that effect. Boom, that's enough. Two different offsuit two pairs and some nine, six suited, six, four suited. And overbet is not allowed anymore, right? This is a video of a video of a video of a video of a video of a video of a video of a video of a video of a video of a video of card, putting more straights out there, right? Exactly, overbet not allowed. We stick to something, and I don't care whether it's 66, 75, 85. You can discuss that and this is usually just what kills time because in the end there is no correct and then there is a correct for this spot and a little other correct for the next spot that it doesn't help you in game okay back to our little game i made it the king of hearts and again we are looking for the same thing the same five categories first category remember value all the way all right so please try to nail it and i'm proud of you and get silas here thousand points ahead doing good job josh anthony b mantas curtis everything possible let's go ace seven five king rainbow value all the way usually the easiest one. So, okay, here we go. So for some people, ACE10 apparently was good enough. The queen jack, I hope was a misclick that it's not a value hand. And here we see, and this is what I mean with the value threshold, but ACE10 is not totally wrong, right? It's like ACE jack makes the cut. This is what I'm always looking for. When I'm on the turn, first step, think about which sizing I'm using. Very clear here, king of hearts. I only use the overbet sizing, boom. Next step, I look for the value threshold. The weakest hand, I'm betting. At the same time, I know, okay, I'm checking this and worse, where, well, I would have nailed this one. This is just experience. And I make clear cuts, right? I'm not trying to mix that 50-50. I don't care at all, right? It just means it does not matter, right? It's just I'm betting my ace-jack always, and I'm checking my ace-10 always. That's it, right? Probably I'm just betting my ace-5 always as well, which is, on lots of cards, not a river bet because our two pair gets counterfeited. And this is why it's a nice check back as well. It's like not giving up. It's not a trap. It's not giving up too much value. If the river is a six, eight, nine, 10 jack, it's super close to still bet after an overbet. Okay. So next step, the next, another very easy one, equity bluffs, I guess, super obvious, a seven, five King. We know what is not equity. We want to have equity against river calling range we want to be drawing to nuts okay so you see here we could discuss that but there's i hope that's fine there's not a clear thing right or wrong but eight nine, nine suited, definitely having nut gut shot, four outs, queen jack, again, nut gut shot, four outs. Pocket deuces, I counted as right here actually, right? Because it's just, it's two outs to the freaking nuts. It's like not as great as gut shot, but it's more deceptive at the same time. So it's like, it's two outs. Again, two outs are 4% to hit something nutted. And before you say like, okay, this time it's a good board for me and I barrel my freaking 10-8 off and check back your pocket deuces, that would be again, right? Manuel Neuer is striker, Cristiano Ronaldo in goal. That's like, even if it's just 4%, it's a game changer. 4% to win freaking stacks here. And this is what you can see in Pio as well. All right, Queen-Jack, boom, let's go. Fuck it, right? 8-9 suited, just all the time. Pocket deuces actually, well, have no showdown value in checking back. The limit's not checking down any kind of queen high. So it's one of the next best potential bluffs with equity against river calling, right? That's like a pretty cool one, actually, right? So it's, yeah, I mean, it didn't let that run forever. This is like something that should show you. If you look at the EVs here with pocket deuces, the overbatted EV is way higher. So actually, if I keep, if I keep PIO running here, it will increase the frequency of that because right now overbetting EV is higher. So actually the pocket deuces will almost be a hundred percent frequency bet in the end. And this is why I gave it a yes here, but yeah, not nailing this one is obviously fine. That's a kind of a definition thing. So yeah, but again, that fits that category. Next one. I think, what was the next one? Oh, this was equity bluff here. Next one again, potential river bluff. Okay. We have no flush draw here. Hmm. Interesting. A75 king rainbow. A75 king rainbow. We are looking for a hand that we barrel on the turn with already a plan to have good potential river bluff Focusing on river fold equity Okay, Queen-jack. Yeah blocking some calling range some folding range It's just like it's mainly blocking hands that are indifferent if villain has ace jack it's like okay fuck it so no positive effect so i don't count it into that category 10-8 the bullshit hand nothing at all pocket three is blocking a three does that increase our river fold equity no five four of hearts it is right so let's have a look right again turn four or five in there five six just having a five now using the suits to counterfeit some certain suited or offsuit two peers it's like nothing to worry about too much actually something like jack five already is in there sometimes so and we can have a look already that okay if we bet that it's already pretty cool because we we block pocket fives which villain has like low frequency right now the turn is mainly blocking folding range which sucks but it decreases like villain snap calls and now let's have a look at the river let's get us a super brick deuce what happens we can guess already we have 176 dollars in the middle and we have 426 dollars behind so the main range we are betting is freaking three times pot all in so if we do that and we see already all our 5x 4 5 5 6 jack 5 queen 5 100 bets right so we see that already because if we jam what is villain's calling range well ace 5 offsuit think about offsuit combos are important blocking those is what makes it a good river bluff like having a 10 8 10 8 blocks nothing bucket else was there? Queen-jack. Well, actually ace-jack is not even a mixed call or anything. So queen-jack just blocks falling range. Yeah, it's the four, it's the five-x, it's the whatever. If the turn was the other way around, was like, let's say the board was ace-king-seven, turn five, it works the same way. Then it's the turn card. Like, because it's, and it's often like that, that if your turn pair doesn't have showdown value value it's one of the best blockers to go for for a bluff it just feels weird to bluff with a peer but does your five have showdown value here i mean villains may be calling threes on the flop and then checks down but that's about it so um yeah very very nice one here for all those that got the five four correctly here and to have an idea at the same time thinking about okay if villain misses that and never has those weird type of fans do we ever need to bluff catch on the river to to check that out make sure to watch the bluff catch in coaching session i did so yeah i think last category now was it no four turn bluff but almost never river river bluff let's see tough one next year again i repeat the board a75 rainbow turn bluff, but almost never river bluff. Okay, so pocket deuces, actually, when something gets there, it it's a very very high frequency river bluff because it just unblocks all folding ranges like it doesn't have negative effects jack six this is random air ball and the four five we've just learned that this is just always a river bluff so actually there is none here and because we didn't really have that category today I still want to want to tell you it does exist it always exists when there is not enough equity bullshit around right so we always start with hands that want to barrel the turn that still have equity to have equity to hit a hand on the river to still have another value bet right so to get back to equity to reference points i want to have equity against villains river calling range and on those type of boards the two we looked at today there were plenty of those hands so we didn't need those super air balls and then that would be the next step if there's not too much stuff like that and we need to have super air balls as bluffs then we look for those with the best blocker effects right so it might be something let's say we start betting big on like ace, king, seven. And then the turn is a brick. Sure, we have lots of equity stuff, but we know villain has 16 times queen, jack, 16 times queen, 10, 16 times jack, 10. Maybe he did three bet suited ones a little, so it's a little less, but all those random brick gut shots on the turn. And then we have bluffs, for example, like random two cards that do not have a queen, jack, queen jack or 10 with that goal we are just targeting that freaking missed gutshot that folds the turn now this is what that category is about so keep it in mind even though i didn't have example there weren't really hands in those examples here okay now the last one seal us on fire so let's go last category was the check back one which ones do fit check back to call bluff or race on the river Thank you. Last category was the check back one. Which ones do fit check back to call, bluff, or raise on the river? Okay, here we go. So important that most of you nailed the aces kings problem, right? It's like now something, okay, we check back all kings. So it might be a little trap that, okay, we want to check back our kings as well, which is sometimes the deal. If we don't have a big advantage, right? If actually villain does a lot of action, then it works a little like that because villain will attack our king X. And then it's good to have like our kings in the same range. This will be case in three bad pots etc no here it's we have the advantage we have to do all the job to go direction all in and then we are mainly targeting ace x and ace x two pairs so kings are the freaking gin best hand possible even though we are probably not c betting here too often with kings on that flop aces right we had the question before already for like pocket queens example or or for the pocket kings one, I'm not sure. Here it works. And villain does not have too many offsuit, straighty, drawy bullshit hands. So it's actually okay to keep them all in, right? And we can have a look here. Freaking aces, they want to check. Ace four, obviously not having value, not folding out. If villain folds now, he at maximum had a gut shot. So I rather keep that in and collect more money later and be protected on the river just still having top hair so pretty nice queen four actually is one that is makes a very very good river bluff just unblocking all that nine eight six bullshit right it's like okay if it goes check check river is a deuce you like queen four is a strong bluff compared to if we have something like 10-8 bullshit, it's a way weaker bluff. Just given those few blockers, or even when we look at that if villain block bets, which he does a lot with those bullshit hands, it's low frequency because this is how the solver works. But still queen four is one of the first ones that you can start bluffing. Just like unblocking the right things. So again, we could argue whether that makes the category, but there are no clear cuts just to give ideas, right? Just looking at that double check and pile and understand the reasoning behind it in a way. So very nice. That was the last question. So let's have a look. I guess Silas shipped that one here today. Third place, Anthony, congrats for that. We have no prizes today, but you can feel super proud and make sure to visit Curtis Quiz Night on Friday again. Are there prizes? I don't know. Definitely fun. And yeah, all the others, just hope you learned something from that. And now coming back to the last two slides here. Okay, getting a little to those exploitative thoughts. Here, it's really tough to prepare things, but because there's not like, we had in one of the last coachings, the obvious one, we're like, okay, what to do if people do not check race enough? I think we can plan on the flop, but this is already a very special situation where we need to come up with ideas in game. So I want to focus always on where does our EV come from? And I broke it down a little. Which jobs do we need to be done by our hands? Which hand categories fit for which jobs? Who is Neuer? Who is Messi? Who is our Cristiano Ronaldo? And now the thing is, okay, where does our EV come from? When we check back, our EV comes from villain improves to a second best hand and we get value or villain bluffs something that has nothing. This is our value. And this is where our EV comes from. And this can change depending on villain's tendencies. So so I just listed potential mistakes by villain. Right on the turn, villain might be overfold. Well, we could be over bluffing now on the turn. Or at the same time, we could, well, we actually need to, we cannot value bet as thinly anymore. Right? If his calling range is tighter, it's probably stronger. So maybe we have to check some thin value bets instead. He might not be raising enough. That means, oh oh we realize more equity when there is a spot where he should do lots of check raising then we can just barrel all our equity hands maybe he's raising too often well then we can then we shouldn't probably check back our pocket aces top set we just bet a small sizing and induce whatever right this is now because i just want to talk about the turn decision the other option would be what does what, what is like our turn decision. The other option is checking. So I'm interested in what can villain do wrong against our turn check back. He might be not bluffing too often on the river. So what do I do? I take my value hands and rather bet on the turn. I'm not checking back my aces. I'm not checking back my ace four. I rather just take another street right now. Like, especially when there's a flush draw and anything, and they are clear, a clear range part that calls now i when my ev and checking back and catching bluffs is less i'm rather choosing another line he might not he maybe is not value betting thin enough well then actually i don't need to be too protected on the river and i can yeah that's it pretty much and i should i should whenever someone is more passive i should dictate the size of the pot a little more myself. Yeah, value betting. You might be value betting too thinly. Well, then I need to prepare like thin river raises against that. And I need to make sure to check back the correct hands. But this is all step by step. And the way to there is to really understand, okay, where's the EV coming from? And yeah, what does that, how does villains mistake or tendencies? How do they change the EV of certain lines with my hands? Okay. Now the last slide is a very short summary. I think I summarized a couple of times. There is just, I think about your whole team, right? Think about your whole range and your options. Then we talked about how ranges are structured. You choose a size that hurts villains range because your range is freaking linear. This is the dream, right? Any sizing is fine for your range. You can find this. You just bet different hands. You bet a little thinner for value, a little less than for value. So you find that sizing that hurts him, which is just what we did, right? Is it okay? How often does he improve, et cetera? You pick your value threshold. This is just a clear cut that you have in your mind to know, okay, this is what I have. This is what I bet. This is what I checked back. And then think in those categories and split those hands up wisely. That should help me a lot where I know like, hey, I'm looking for something. What on the turn? What will I bluff if this straight gets there? What will I bluff if this flush gets there? Gives you way, way, way more options and just ideas in game. Like, okay, actually that four or five blocking that two pierce that villain is down. Does it have showdown value? Is it a good triple barrel? What are my hands here? What is my bluff to then bluff later on given runouts, et cetera, right? So those categories are just a little tool regarding divide and conquer. Really nail it even more and more. Instead of just thinking, is this a good hand to barrel or not? Because then you will always find reasons for and for and against right you're maybe you're unblocking his top pairs that are calling but you're blocking whatever at the same time and then you it's like a mess right it's just like think think like about clear categories and find your hands there so really again this is what i want you to have as a takeaway it's not about luck whatever it's about you are the freaking manager and you want to have your hands play the perfect role for them. If your hand is a freaking minion or it's Lewandowski, just give it the right job. And then in the end, the hands will pay back pretty much. So yeah, that was a little longer today, but thanks for listening for everyone who tuned in and see you next time. Shout out again to the winners of the little quiz show here. And yeah, that's it. See you next time. And as always, leave any comments or whatever in Slack and any feedback there. See you then. Good luck at the tables. Bye-bye.
