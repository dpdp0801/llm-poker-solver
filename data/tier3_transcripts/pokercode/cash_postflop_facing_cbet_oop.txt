### TOPIC: cash postflop facing cbet oop
 Today's video is about the spot where we defend the big blind out of position and face villain's continuation bet. I'm going to show you how I think about playing in this spot, which hands to defend passively, which hands aggressively and about potential exploits when thinking about that. Let us first talk about the spot we are in. We defended the big blind out of position. Villain did open race. That means already we have a disadvantage. We don't have the best hands in our range anymore. Therefore, we will mainly, if not always, start the hand by checking. And then it is villain's turn to build his wardrobe. As we've learned ourselves, when checked to us, we decide as aggressor how the spot continues. Now it's just the different perspective. We are caught in the reaction game. We check it's villain's turn to decide how he wants to continue and then we need to react accordingly. Mainly this is all about two parameters. Number one is villain sizing of the continuation battle. That tells us his risk reward. How much is he risking? How much do we need to pay to continue? This is very important to understand how that changes our whole defense of the spot. And the beautiful thing about that, this is what we see. The other parameter is a little tougher. It is villain's range. And this is what we need to find out. How does villain's wardrobe look like? Is he only using the size we are seeing right now is he betting his full range with a small sizing is he checking back sometimes is he using multiple sizings and what is the range we are actually facing right now this is way tougher and gives us lots of room for reads that we can have. So, this is what we want to keep an eye on. As pretty much always I'm splitting up this spot as well. I split it up in only two parts that we need to think about. Step one is build your defending range. This is what we start with. We face a certain seabed sizing. This tells us the price we are getting and at the same time the risk reward that villain is putting himself into. He's investing a certain amount of money to win what is in the middle. And now how to start building our defending range is as we pretty much always start with. We need to get a general idea of how ranges play in that spot. Nothing else what we do in position. Who has the advantage? Who has more nuts right now? Who has more nuts over time? Which turns help villain? Which turns help us? What is the general impression overall? will the pot continue who should be more the aggressive part who is willing to build a pot direction all in who wants to keep the pot small all those questions can help us to get that general impression to then look at, well, what is the actual price we are getting? There is a term like minimum defense frequency that is used very often when it comes to defending versus a certain bet size. This is nothing else but not giving villain free money. He risks a certain amount to win what is in the middle. That tells us how often we need to defend and how often we are allowed to be folding to still not give villain EV if he has a hand without equity. So this is something that is a baseline we should keep in mind that often our defending range will fit to. But as we've already figured out we are pretty much always having a clear disadvantage. That means it is okay to give Will an EV. He does better on a lot of boards and this is why we need to evaluate the ranges as general as possible to get an idea how much stronger is villain can we give him money by over folding right on the flop or should we fight hard for what is in the middle? I want to give you a couple of examples to point that out. Example number one. The one I used already when we were talking about in position bet sizings. So you have seen that chart already for in position. And here now we want to look at the reaction for the out of position player. We're in a spot button versus big blind. The board is ace king for rainbow. And now the button decided to go for a 120% over bet c-bet. Let's first do the pure math. Minimum defense frequency. Villain risks 120% of the pot to win back his bet and to win the 100% of the pot that is in the middle. So this is his risk reward. What that mean we can fold 54 percent and villain is still not making money or this is his break even point which means we need to defend a total of 45.45 percent right if he was betting pot it would be 50 percent etc so what we see here now is a board where the button has a huge advantage. A clear nut advantage right now and also nut advantage over time because there will only be turn cards that help button as well. And what we see here is now that we out of position should only defend about 40%. We see a 60% fault frequency, which is clearly higher than what the minimum defense frequency is telling us. So we have that baseline, but as well we can evaluate that, hey, this board is really bad for us. So making quite some tight folds right on the flop is the correct thing. When we talk about hands, well, just check out certain mid pairs. We see that king 9 off, for example, is 100% fold. King 10 off, pretty much always folding. King jack off, 50 50-50 right. Just not great hands to continue with even though that is a strong mid pair. On other boards that would be a great hand but here the in position advantage is just too good and this is why over folding on the flop is quite a thing. Example number two. The other one we talked about already in other videos. 9-5 deuce rainbow. Yes, in position again has a clear advantage here but not necessarily over time. Pretty much any turn card makes the big blind catch up by a lot, especially those with the straight runouts. So, hmm, clearly not that big of an advantage. Let's look at the math first. Here, villain is c-betting with a half pot c-bet. So he's risking way less than in the example before. That means we need to defend way more. A half pot gives villain a risk reward that he needs 33% fold equity. This is what we can give him, right? But we see here that overfolding is not really happening. The solver suggests about that 33-34% folding. This is where the baseline really fits to the praxis and that fits to what we want to do first, a general impression. How do ranges play? And here, well, the button does well but it's not like freaking owning us so here we don't want to go crazy with over folding and make sure that we defend a certain amount of hands so now we figured out our defending range which is pretty much an outcome of the minimum defense frequency and a general impression of how good do we do on a certain board, evaluating nut advantage right now, nut advantage over time, equity in general. And now we get to the second step. Well, we now built a defending range and it's the time now to decide how do we continue. With two options. We can check raise or we can check call. And here I clearly want to focus on the raising part. That's usually the little smaller part. So I want to see or have a guideline of which hands do I want to check raise and well just everything that I don't want to check raise goes into my check call. So really focusing on my check raising range helps me to answer both those questions and this mainly depends on the questions what are my upsides with fast playing. Do I want to build a pot because I have not advantage over time and I will turn lots of cards that give me nuts and I already plan on playing for stacks pretty often. Do I want to attack a certain wide range that villain is c-betting with to deny equity of weaker hands? Are there any other upsides why I want to be check raising? I already gave a long community coaching where I went in depth in that topic So I don't want to repeat that too much here and I want to give you the advice of checking that out check raising deep with Stefan and Fedor it should be in the channel by now next to this video here make sure to check this out and really focus on well what is my check raising range because that will tell you your calling range as well just everything that is left that you want to defend. Let me summarize that once more. We defend the big blind, we are out of position.ain decides to do his continuation bet with a certain sizing. That sizing tells us Villain's risk reward ratio as well as the price we are getting to continue. With this we can calculate the minimum defense frequency that we can use as a baseline. We need to take into account how ranges play overall to decide whether we want to stick to this minimum defense frequency or we want to maybe overfold a little because villain has a clear advantage. Then we have our overall defending range which is step one and that brings us to then step two. Having our defending range we need to decide which of that part we want to play aggressively by check raising and which of that part we want to play passively by calling. There I gave you the advice to check out the community coaching I gave with Fedor regarding check raising deep. I explain in there in depth what is important when building your check raising range, how to deviate to like higher frequency or lower frequency, where are potential exploits there. This will be all in that video that you can find in this channel here as well. And now I want to wrap that up with some general thoughts because this is all all nice and easy and there is so much talk about the flop facing a c-bet just i have to call because the solver says so i have to call because i have the equity and i don't like all that because in the end i want to understand things and it is always about where does our ev come from and i really want to see every bet that i'm making every race that i'm making or every bet that i'm calling as an investment and i want you to be good investors which means to only invest money when you can expect a positive return. And therefore, I want you to know where to expect that return. And I will talk a little more in depth about that in the next video about potential exploits. Because it is crucial to know where does our money come from is it about hitting a hand on the turn and then villain going crazy is it villain shutting down us often seeing two more cards and potentially ending up in a great spot to create ev with a river bluff is it villain directly overfolding versus check raises where we make the ev where is it and i want to be as precise as possible there even though we are caught still in the reaction game it is villain's spot he is making the We want to understand those. We want to spot his mistakes and then go after him.
