### TOPIC: cash postflop facing cbet oop hand review
 Alright, finally, this video is going to be about facing a seabed out of position versus the preflop aggressor and how to continue. So just to give you a little context, I played a session like two or three weeks ago and I already did that video once, unfortunately without sound. so here I'm sitting again trying my best the sound is on for sure and now I don't have the hands in my brain so much anymore so it's really kind of a new view on them I'll still try to put you through my thought process and I hope it will be the same one like last time so let's just get started and jump right into the action. Hand number one. We have cut off open raising 2.25x, I defend in the big blind, we have no reads, nothing on the hud, so queen do suited standard defend and now just going through the process of facing a c-bet he goes for a large c-bet. My hand is obviously a fold but still important to think about and maybe something to note even that this villain is using a large c-bet on that board structure right that can help us the next time he c-bets only three dollars here. And to catch up again with the theory part we want to think in two steps first building our defending range and that depends on villain's range everything we know about it and mainly his sizing this is the price we are getting the better the price the more hands we can or should or need to continue this is a very bad very bad price on a board where we have clear disadvantages and he's really targeting our weak jack-axe and eight-axe and weak gut shots right away. And obviously everything that is as bad as my hand is just a snap fold. Second step after building our defending range is actually splitting that up into a check raising range and into a check calling range. We'll mainly think about the check raise and everything else that is left will go into the check call. But I'm pretty sure we'll see a couple of hands where that will be more interesting than with that standard fold here. All right, second hand. So middle position now, open raises, same sizing like before, ace-four suited, potentially a three bet. I'm calling this time. This guy seems to be like a standard regular 2318, is a little on the tighter side, 7.63 bet is a little on the tighter side. That's all I know. So he starts off with like a rather normal opening range. I defend. Pretty much a similar board like before and now what we see is okay a different sizing than before. Not that 66% now it's like 42, 43%. What what does it mean well we need to defend a little more and probably we can only guess his c-betting range is a little weaker than the one with a bigger size before so we can check raise actually a little more as well again our hand no option at all next Next one, another ace-4 off, this time facing a 2.5x from the button. Very clear defend here. I mean, not that 100% clear, but we are always defending. This guy is another regular. You see I have 6,000 hands on him. He seems like having a little looser stats than the guy before. Super standard 25 21 9.7 so I expect quite an aggressive normally playing type of regular here. Defending and what happens I flop an overcard, I flop a get shot. Oh ace will often stay in overcard and actually I think this one does not really fit into the topic because he's checking back but still this can happen I don't want to go too much into detail on that board if he was c-betting well we need to really be careful about the sizing because everything we are having here is like two overcards or somewhat connected to the board how strong is a 9 9-10? How strong is a jack-9 suited with a backdoor flush draw? How strong is king-jack offsuit? How strong is something like ace-4, ace-3 with a gut shot? Or something like ace-8, ace-9? And so here we have lots of hands that are somewhat interested in continuing, but facing a bigger size we get into trouble. So this is something where we need to really react to the sizing and important for me is when you guys discuss hands that this is a big part of it. Often people just talk about yeah it's 6-5-2, I face a c-bet so I call. We for me it's a huge difference here. Facing a 30% c-bet or a 75% c-bet. And that will change a lot with all those offsuit over cards I'm having. So here the turn I bink my straight. I think I have multiple options here but this is another topic. I decided to go for a big here small is fine check is fine I just want to be with my range a lot on the betting side having way more 4x and low pairs than villain has after checking back the river is an ace I think my hand just fits a lot into a small betting range actually that I would do with something like ace seven maybe as well for value i can just play my straight and bet big even though i block the ace i don't know how much of a thing that is i don't like too much the overbet i went for here but yeah i mean i have a straight right so back to our topic we see already villain's hand here which is the signs that we will see a showdown but let's focus on the thought process on the flop main villain does whoa again not c-bet you see i don't really remember the hands too much but this makes it interesting So now this fits into our topic even though we are not facing a c-bet because this is so important to realize in game because that's a board that people should check back with quite some frequency but lots of players are not doing that they just see like queen high under the gun let's go range bet whatever right and against those we can be quite aggressive with the nut advantage that we will create over time given that seven five connectivity a six a four an eight and nine will be very very good for the big blind on all those runouts and they will come there. So if under the gun is c-betting too wide here we can create EV or probably that leads to over folding when we think about check raising. Now here very important this guy decided to check back. So what does that mean? Well I want to know how does his check back range look like. This check back gives me lots of information about about his check back range look like this check back gives me lots of information about his check back range it contains air and it gives me information about his c betting range his c betting range is stronger so here i have a mid like third pair nothing else i can do but checking and now on the river i think i can only check and i would i have a bluff catcher against the bet. Villon can have jacks tens and find a value bet here. He can have pocket sixes five six six seven for sure. I mean actually in game I'm snap folding if Villon bets and this year is just a face up blunder right here not betting he's pretty much not low against I mean I'm folding like I don't know 70 80 percent in that spot pretty certainly yeah seeing him having reggie stats and leaving this money on the table for us this is where we see edge this always feels great in game so even though we did not face a c-bet we did learn a lot about c-bet strategies overall and how to continue versus that all right next one five six suited again potentially a three bet against that guy he's folding quite a lot to three bets definitely definitely something i will do quite often i think for the sake of the video i clicked on the call button. And now what are we facing here? A seabed, a small seabed that I expect to be close to a range seabed, very high frequency. We can even double check whether we have further information here. Let me just see where is that what I'm looking for. Not here. Here. Seabed in position in a single spot just 64 so this is obviously great stats to have whether that is 100 like for some people or just something lower i can expect him now to check back kings queens but without that we can still try to figure it out right the note we talked about before with the guy with ace-twos of hearts. And here, we could make the note at some point, well, probably checking back kings here, queens here, maybe some weak aces, maybe some here. And now our question is how to proceed with our weak flush draw. I think, I mean, first step, we are definitely defending, right? Second step, call or raise. I think both options are fine here. I prefer to have better flush draws for the check raise because it's kind of preparing a cooler. Let's say he has five, six, and I have king three of diamonds. He will definitely call all diamonds versus a check raise. So I want to be on the better side there. if i do that here and actually at the river third diamond comes and then i jam and he still has all high card diamonds in his range i'm just like my flush is not as strong here i have additionally that that straight draw so three four seven and eight give me straight draws on the turn. This is why I quite like the check raises. Well, I think I went for the call here. Turn is one of the worst cards in the deck for me, facing an overbet. Snap fold, all good, but the thought process on the flop is important. What are your check raises here on the flop? Which gut shots, which flush draws, which deuce X, which 9 X, which real hands? Make make your mind up regarding that because this will help you so much just playing then a turn, right? Let's say we did check raise the flop. How do I hit that Queen? Well, not at all. Really? I Know that about my check raising range actually it decreases the value of my value hand, something like ace-9, ace-2 is way weaker now because the one clearly has all combinations of ace-queen. So this is all the stuff that is important when you think already about the flop, and that will help you facing the c-bet, building your range splitting it up into call and check raise all right next hand six seven of hearts he open raises that's not so interesting for us but i defend ace nine suited villain does c-bet on that board again he can c-bet very high frequency on that board my ace nine of spades is definitely first step again needs to continue against that sizing i have the backdoor not flush draw i have an over card to the board and an over card to the mid pair or to the mid card so yeah definitely strong enough to continue here now the question is hey what about check raising maybe? Same thought process, right? I know it's in my defending range, now I want to know what do I check raise, what do I check call? And here I know for sure I want to have some backdoor nut flush draws in both of those ranges. My only thought is about which of the backdoor nut flush draws I'm having do I want to fast play and which do I want to slow play? Where is good stuff happening for me? And here I'm a little focused on like the other draw I'm having. It's not only a backdoor flush draw it's as well a draw to a top pair. So what happens if I check raise? Well villain folds ace 3, ace 4, ace 5, ace 6, ace 7. He might continue with like ace 10, ace jack, ace king with the backdoor flush draw which is actually bad for me. If I hit my draw and ace on the, well that's really bad because then I'm on the bad side of it. If I check call my ace-9, well, and then hit an ace, villain still has ace-7, ace-6, ace-5, ace-4, ace-3, so I have a little cooler on the side for me. So here I would always go with like ace-3, ace-4, ace-5 being the ones I'm check-raising sometimes or quite often, often an ace nine is a pure call here for me this is my reasoning for that okay that three is a brick villain checks back that queen is i mean a good card for me because i'm obviously ahead very often villain might have all kinds of king 10 jack 10 weaker ace x whatever if it goes check check i win quite often if i face a bet i have to make a decision i have a random bluff catcher i decided to go for that catch this time i think this is a mix whatever depends on on his likeliness to bluff here i got him this time with the seven six of hearts i think he played it fine i played. We're all good here. All right next spot 10-9 off suit. Defending, clear defend, very easy flopping trips. And now the first question obviously how do we continue here versus a c-bet with our range. Willan he doesn't go super small, it's like third pot even a little more. No no it's third pot right and now the question is okay what is my plan where is my advantage i want to check call most ace x i want to check call some nine x i want to check raise some nine x what else am i defending like i have something like deuces threes fours five six sevens eights I have some flush draws what about something like king jack with the king of diamonds something like that so I have both ranges and now the question is how can I hurt villain and here I mean 9x makes trips he's from the button so he has all the offsuit 9x right he has 10 9 offs offsuit maybe even 9-8 offsuit jack 9 queen 9 king 9 so 9x is not where i have the huge advantage that would be different if it's like a 6-6 for example then i would be way more incentivized to fast play and go direction all in with all my sixes here i don't want to go all in right ending up losing to queen nine king nine jack nine offsuit and he has all of those so i'm kind of slow playing sometimes calling sometimes check raising but not with a plan to go all in right will be like a check raise and then check again or a check raise and normal sizings etc i think this hand i prefer having a diamond for that additional equity for check raising and i prefer my kicker to be higher for check raising so king nine will be quite some check raising 10-9 with the diamonds will be quite some check raising 9-8 with spades will probably be more of a check call here i did check raise and t-folds all right next one 9-7 suited versus under the gun again very very interesting we do not face a c-bet we clearly know what we would do against a c-bet snap fold find that find that fold button we are not really having a gut shot but him checking back a board like that can give us a read right you see the type of guy who just always checks back jack zero or like ace queen and this is his only hand strength or is he the type of guy who is just like pocket fives i have nothing and checks back and then we can profitably bluff him off that later i don't know like first thought nl200 people are just playing their hand strength a lot right when checking back that board i expect him to have ace queen or jack 10 or pocket jacks well i still have all two pairs i have ace jack offsuit i have jack nine offsuit i have pocket sixes i have whatever and then i need to add bluffs i have some flush draws i have some ace x nine seven is well i mean double gutter, even though the jack is not really that interesting. But I went with a big size, just putting on like a queen or a 10 and play that the same way I would do with my jack-9 or ace-jack, etc. So happy to take it down here. But the key is not the turn play here in this video for me.'s about realizing what happens on the flop we can learn something about villains c betting range mainly in those spots where they don't c bet right seeing a showdown in that spot would be incredibly interesting we have seen the ace deuce of hearts but if this guy is checking back ace deuce of spades here i mean thanks for the free card and the chance to bluff you off right and note that down all right ace five offsuit and well again c villain's hand that's a good sign that we get to showdown and let's see now again the same process we are facing a small c-bet. Hmm. Ace-5. We have ace high we have a five which has some straight connectivity we have probably some advantage over time given that board because the six and the four connects well and we are the person who has more of that five three five seven five deuce five eight suited so once there will be a three a deuce a five a seven an eight or a six or a four we should have that more as well we can go a little crazy and because we know lots of those runouts will contain those low cards we can be a little more aggressive right now already i really don't like the ace of hearts in my hand though so i know against that sizing i think i need to continue my ace five here but i don't want to check raise it because that ace of hearts is just a card that well if villain has it he's always bad folding right if he has a seven offsuit with the ace of hearts ace eight or just ace eight suited with the ace of hearts that are the bad folds and if i'm check raising i'm clearly hoping to fold out something so if i had the ace of spades five of clubs here i might consider that obviously having a backdoor flush draw is better but that would be fine i guess Here I go for the check call. My hand is just a little too strong to fold right away. Queen, obviously one of the worst cards again in the deck for me. He has the fourth pair now, checks back, and another queen. I think I still beat quite something. He might check back some kind of 9-7 on the turn, not bluff bluff now or maybe splitting against some other ace-axe and yeah so no reason to bluff here for me he has a peer that's all good right but again the thought process on the flop is important looking at the sizing building your defending range and then have a clear idea how your check raising range looks like on a board like that. All right now I guess one of the most interesting hands in the session. So the full session I just played 30 minutes had like 11 or 12 of those spots where I was defending the big blind and potentially facing a c-bet. So you see this is something you can play your next session you will you know it will come up and now let's have a look at that guy rock some rock wilder i have this special stat here or like all that combined stuff i don't know whether you can see it or it's too small but it says single race part c-padbet in position, 93%. That is a lot, right? So if he's not sure, he will be c-betting or he's only checking back some certain hands on like the worst boards ever. That is what that means to me. And 2,300 hands is enough sample for me. So what do we see here? 10 see here 10 5 3 how good is that board for the cutoff range and how good is it for the big blind it would be better for the big blind if it was like 10 6 4 just to have more of those straight options but still 10 5 3 hits the big blind quite well not necessarily right now but over time deuce 3 4 5 6 7 all great cards for the big blind we know that already right now so here we face a small c-bet someone i don't know how much he's allowed like how what does a solver suggest how much he should c-bet but definitely not a hundred percent this guy though is likely to just bet a hundred percent which means king nine offsuit every queen jack offsuit ace seven of hearts ace eight offsuit and then good luck defending versus aggression so now first thought for me is okay against this specific guy I want to widen my defending range because his c-betting range is too weak for that board where actually I'm doing quite well and then I should know okay what are my standard check raises and how can I go a little more crazy. The standard check raises here are some 10x, 53 suited 10-5 suited some flush draws 4-6 deuce 4 suited 6-7 4-5 3-4 5-7 all that pierre plus backdoor straight plus backdoor flush draw but the next stuff would be something like king six of clubs well ace four ace deuce obviously yeah actually that king six of hearts is obviously in theory just a fold but with my read i have on him and the playability of that hand which is it's not nothing it has a three outer to hit the top here it has straight connectivity with that three five plus an over card to the to the middle pier yes so i went a little crazy here as an exploit and added that first in my defending range and then deciding that I want to fast play that. Getting the perfect result here with a snap fold. But just check out the risk reward maybe as well. When we want to attack those small sizings, when people are likely to c-bet with too high of a frequency i'm risking 12 to win those 14.5 so this only needs to work 45 percent of the time something like that and actually that calculation is without thinking about any equity we might have at all and as i said we have some equity so probably just something between 35 maybe 38 percent full equity is totally fine here to make that a profitable play and I think there are players against who we might have like 60 or something like that and then we start printing money so I like having those those exploitive check raises in my arsenal for sure. Okay let's see I'm just double checking how many more hands and I'm I have no clue I guess that might be one of the last hands. Ace-8 offsuit it's close but he's pretty much min raising. We face that board which is a board where he is actually allowed to c-bet full range. So thinking about where I want to exploit and widen my defending range I'm thinking about the boards where villain is likely to make a mistake already. When villain is allowed to range bet well I'm interested in the cases where they check back for sure that's a read but they cannot really make a mistake by c betting the 10-5-3 people can oversee bets so i can crush them by showing some aggression here i mean my hand is nothing but just having other maybe weaker hands that might be interested in the pot i would never think about like check raising like crazy because what am I attacking a range that is allowed to range bet because it's just that strong on a board so this is something to keep in mind what are the boards that we want to exploit a little something and which are the boards where actually we have to accept that we are just too weak here this is definitely one of the latter one all right is this the last yes this was the last so i hope you enjoyed that that was just 30 minutes of the session where i came up or like those spots came up i think 11 or 12 hands what we had here and maybe four of them were snap falls and like three four others were easy continues and then we had some to think about whether to check raise or not maybe close defense and we talked a little bit about which board structures are we focusing on where is villain likely to make a mistake where do we want to think on the exploitative side and always keeping in mind those two steps step number one building your defending range first step number two deciding how to split that range into check race and check call with a key element for you of knowing your range and proceed with that in the spot in the right way. Your turn plays will get so much better once you actually know what your range is.
