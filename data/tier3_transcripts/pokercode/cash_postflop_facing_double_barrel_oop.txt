### TOPIC: cash postflop facing double barrel oop
 All right. Good afternoon, everyone. Regards back to the Kings. Hey, hey, hello guys, Daniel, bad bits, Damien, obviously. As always, we'll wait a couple of minutes just to allow people to jump in as well, the Kahoot. So make sure to join here as well. I've got a couple of questions, so kind of one section of tougher questions, a little puzzle there where I will show you something probably new and you can try to get the most out of it right away. And then we'll have a couple of example hands where I guess answers are actually pretty easy. So you can just be kind of sure to collect some points there. All right. So 2E Barino. Today we are playing the reaction game. So probably not too much 2E happening there from our side, but maybe some check raises. But we'll focus on the calling spots because this will be the the major decision today but you never know let's see where things are heading hey hugh great to have you here i'm doing super fine lucas hi is this so here it's a good mix of known faces and some people are we're actually hey philip good to see you frederico second hand obviously pavill and second hand being here 10 minutes early in the the Kahoot. Love to see it. I mean, you can't win the Kahoot if you can't beat those guys. So it's like strong competition today. As always, we will start with a little brainstorm in the beginning. Your chance to give me some input that I can use. And then, yeah, that I can just use throughout the session to maybe answer the questions you personally might have. I prepared something that i think fits to the topic pretty well but yeah can't play kahoot in the car so yeah make sure to to rather listen than watch too much okay so yeah drive safely if you're the driver if not tell your driver to drive safely all right so 24 in here yeah just make sure to to spread the game. Maybe someone can take over the job for me there in the chat as well, because I will just start with the presentation and you won't see it anymore. Just, just put it in the chat. Or if someone asks, you have another like two, three minutes to join the Kahoot and then, and then we'll start things. And let's start with the presentation pretty much as always. So the topic today is facing a double barrel out of position we'll talk about the most obvious spot big line defense calling a c-bat facing a double barrel depending on turn cards and certain range structures we will have over bats we will have normal bat sizes and so on we will see those in the examples but this is kind of a general thing right we face maybe a high frequency c-bet we face a large second barrel kind of polarizing most of the time we are not talking about three bet pots today would be we could obviously have like lots of specialties now but i want to keep it as simple and as general as possible again the spot i already explained we are freaking out of position on the turn. We are not the aggressor. We did defend our big blind. Maybe sometimes we flat from the small blind and it's kind of a similar situation. But yeah, this is the spot. We did call a c-bet on the flop. We are facing a c-bet on the turn again, double barrel. And what is important as well for the explanation is we have all three options. We can either race, we can call, and and we can fold it's different if we are short stacked and face an all-in jam that's not the topic today so maybe this i'll leave this to the mtt world because what in the world are you doing if you face an all-in jam on the turn freaking short stacking no that's not our business so we play real poker interesting poker with let's say 100 hundred bigs or more. So yeah. Chewy burrito working on that. Nice. Okay. Yeah. So that's the spot. And yeah, again, a little structure of the coaching. You see, I love the copy paste from the last presentations, which should help you as well, because I keep the presentation kind of clean and have kind of a clear structure. So we'll start with the same question. I give you every single time regarding that topic, just your chance to leave me, give me any input. So we'll start with the brainstorm question in Kahoot. Then we'll talk a little about decision points. What do I mean with decision points? What do I focus on when I am in that spot? What is important to think about? Then we'll dive a little deeper into investment and return, right? It's like when we're at the table, it's so easy to get emotional, to be able to be in that trap of like, does he have it or not? That's not enough for that spot. So I like to call that kind of zooming out and really see our potential call or our potential raise, or even the potential fold as an investment and see like, where's my return? And is that a positive play or is it the max EV play in the end? What are those returning streams? I call it, I have no clue whether that is good English or not, but that's just the word I started using for that. So yeah, what to focus on, where is my EV, what do I try to achieve here and so on. And then having obviously a couple of examples where I just take that into practice. I give my view on things. I made like examples because actually we have only one in-depth example, because I think this is enough. And a couple of like small examples where I show you hands, where I ask you some questions and so on to then follow up with the key takeaways for that session. And I think that should be a nice way to go. All right, let's start with the Kahoot 29 people in there. It's not the last chance. You have the game pin in the chat. Just join in now and you can be ready for the quiz as well. And now, yeah, same question as always, just give me input. What do you expect from the session? What are you looking forward to? I asked the question that way, what is running through your head when facing a double barrel? I'm talking about Pauper, not the real life. So yeah, just focus on that. How do you approach that spot? What are your thoughts making your decisions? I don't know, just anything. I don't want to spoiler too much because i obviously have kind of a clear structure that i go through but happy to read about anything so yeah take your time we have two minutes for that and it can keep going just just post some stuff i'll just keep working on my dinner plans here so obviously it helps me when you put some structure into it already just this this structure i like using all the time. Just like thinking about what would be correct. This kind of one thing, trying to imitate the solver. Like how do you think to get close there? Potential mistakes people are doing obviously always important. Then the follow-up right exploits. How do you approach that spot in general on your stakes, whatever? Feel no worries at all mantas just join the the kahoot you can still late join i guess i don't know whether you can see the numbers that were posted before i'll just copy paste them for you i think you can still join for when it actually matters and feel free to drop any questions in the chat obviously as well as well, if you missed out on this one here. All right. So I'll just have the quick rundown again, equity against his range, full equity for raises, river runouts. All right. So I like that a lot already. We're talking about equities against something, against what exactly? Maybe we want to be a little more precise here, but you kind of talk about it, mentioning river runouts as well. It's like, okay, what can happen next? Looking into the future and the game tree, it's not that the hand is over. Does he have it or not? How often do I win, even though he has value right now? How often, if he has a bluff, will he improve and beat me? Will I fail the value bet? And how's my brain how's my brain structure looking at ourselves improve how many bluffs am i allowed and so on freezing okay now it's better again i don't know just let me know in the chat i don't know whether it's the the internet or anything i did a couple couple of speed tests this morning and it was all good. So I have two different connections now. Let's see. We will get it done. All right. So yeah, I talked about first spot, little equity, about looking ahead in the hand. What is the game tree that follows after our Montenegro SIM card? Yeah, follows up after the turn play. What can happen next? How do I do against different parts of Villain's Ranges? And so so on is my hand a good candidate to call two or even three barrels yeah maybe a little more precise right it's like what am i actually beating and so on what do i have equity against villain type your first explosive thoughts blockers is always like yeah term that is always correct but how to use it possible runouts effective stack size population tendencies maybe some specifics here for your games i don't know are people over bluffing under bluffing what are they doing on the river how is that already important on the turn is willing taking solver sizing incorrect normal sizing scroll up right very nice right it's the typical well people tell us with their sizing their hand because they didn't use the draw like the the they didn't build their wall it's quite often very easy to to i think sizing riverbed frequency how hard it will be to see showdown i guess you're just talking about pure bluff catchers then that all makes sense opponent's position calling more versus late folding more versus what is he actually representing? How wide is his range? How likely is it that he's over bluffing, under bluffing, and so on? Lagging. Okay, wow. I'll change something, guys. I hope I'll still see you in a couple of seconds. Okay, I hope nothing bad is happening now. I'm switching the connection now to the other one. How are things now? Okay, now we got the different connection. No Wi-Fi anymore, but pretty much like the slower connection, but not Wi-Fi anymore. That's the more stable high-stakes grind connection. All right, let's hope. Fingers crossed. Let's go. Yeah, just keep letting me know in the chat if something is bad. All right, but I love the goods there. All right. I love folding because people barrel too much. Again, today's session will be a lot about being precise with things. People barrel too much. Well, if they are over bluffing, why not just call down? Are they barreling too thinly for value? Are they doing this or that? Now, first spot, someone talking about actual value, raise now or later, trapping or not trapping. Another thing, is he the type of opponent that gives up on river bluffs or bang, bang, bangs, right? So it's not only about how does villain play on the turn, but already again, looking into the future. What about his river play? Is it worth to get into the river spot more often because villain messes up there? Might be a cool thing to think about, right? Pot odds, right? Which sizing are which sizing are we actually facing very good obviously what happened pre-flop and flop did he bet big on the flop or did he bet small like what story is he telling yeah what is he actually representing so yeah lots of good stuff i think this is more i see lots of it's interesting right i see lots of kind of standard terms that are mixed together i haven't read a single like clear structure what you think through. I think through number one, this is what I check, number two, number three, number four. So let's try to get some structure into that today. I like it a lot and go from there. And yeah, back to the presentation. And I will just show you a little how I'm thinking. And for me, it's very, very important to think about the correct decision points that we are actually facing when making those decisions. The later we are in the game tree, the more standard it gets and the easier it is to just look at our hand and forget about ranges, right? I mean, everyone knows that if we are bluffing on a river, we just hope for villain to fall. We stop thinking about ranges in anything. It's just like our hand. We want to win now, whatever, right? It's like, we're actually, there are spots where you know you are value heavy. You just have the bluff now. So actually like range wise, you should hope for villain to make a bad call, right? When you're value heavy, stuff like that. So just a little example that, yeah, we stopped thinking about our range. And this is what I want to tackle today in that coaching. That just like, I want you to know where you are at all times, especially in the reaction game. Because it's like, there are pretty much two categories of players. The first is make an assumption as random as it is, even without reads. It's like, yeah, people are over bluffing here. Like, I don't know, right? People are over bluffing here like i don't know right people are not bluffing here that sizing is always value something like that and then following up accordingly like that sizing is always value so i fold all bluff catchers i mean maybe it's somewhat correct it's definitely never super correct it's probably not necessarily wrong but we just don know. So I want to think about my actual structure. Maybe we call the best fluff catchers. Maybe we call those hands that still have equity against Willem's river value bets and so on and so on. So this is something I want to put the focus on. And here now in this spot facing a double barrel, we have three options to choose from. That is a given thing. We can call, we can raise, we can fold. And if we look up a PIO SIM to whatever kind of term spot, we will have a low raising frequency, a high folding frequency to the normalized polarized bet, which means a biggish bet size. And we have quite some calls. So now there are some crucial decision points that I want to put focus on. There are some hands that are just the clearest calls of all times. If we have a top pair, no kicker with a flush draw to go with it, we don't need to think for a single moment. It's like, it doesn't make sense. It's like, just like there's just a call button. There's nothing else. And then there are other spots where actually it's close. It's close between call or fold, or it's close between call or race. Sometimes we have that interesting thing that it's actually close between fold or race, but it's never a call. That can be a thing as well, but it's kind of rare. So this is the first thing that I like to speak out loud. This is where we are at. This is where things are getting interesting. This is where we make decisions. What does our EV depend on? What does need to be true that a zero EV catcher maybe, or zero EV turn call makes a good fold or a clearly plus EV call, right? Now we're talking a little about the exploitative side, but I want to already create that picture of the whole range, right? This is why I don't start off with examples. We'll get there in a second. And now I want to show you how I actually visualize those things. I hope you all love the paint games I'm using. So you get one more of those. And actually this is the visualization I have in my head. So I said already, the majority of decisions will be rather clear, right? So I want to focus on the borders. This is what I just Thank you. I have in my head. So I said already, the majority of decisions will be rather clear, right? So I want to focus on the borders. This is what I just described to you in words. This is how pretty much any PIO reaction to a polarized double barrel looks like. We fold 40 to 50%, depending on villain's bet size, something like that. We call something like 50% and we raise something like zero to 10%, more like zero to 6%, I would say, right? Against large-ish bet sizes. So what is actually interesting for us? I'm not sure whether you see my mouse, but I guess so. So any hand that is just very, very clear, there's nothing to think about, right? So it's just interesting is the one border of our range. What's the weakest hand? Weakest is not necessarily pure showdown value. It's like maybe a top pair with a certain kicker is better than another pair or a second pair with a certain kicker is better than a certain top pair. Can have different influences there. But like the weakest hand in that sense that we still want to call, finding out where that is, and the weakest hand that we think about value raising, for example, once we have those, we have the answer for every other hand in between, right? And for every other hand that is weaker than our weakest call, just a clear fold. So once we find out where we set this border and this can be quite a lot of hands actually right and where we set this border or how we mix that what doesn't fit in the picture is like the decision between fold and race that's like the bluffs we add here that are very close to a fold but never a call they are kind of missing here because they don't just do not really fit into the picture so they are like add-ons but once we know how we play those two parts we're pretty much set for everything right and this is the image i want to have in my head if like let's say i make an example just making this up right now we check all on king five deuce turn is a 10 and villain overbats now it's like my first question are we calling any king i like like just any king what did i say king five deuce turn 10 are we calling king seven probably yes in the simulation right if we put it in the solve yes any king is just a call which five x do we call right so is it like it's ace five better is five six better is whatever and why what are we check raising probably the turn pocket tents probably some of the king 10 turn to pair what is the bluffs that go with those so once we have those quarters everything in the middle is pretty clear right i mean we don't need to discuss that we call a third pair with a flush draw it's like yeah it's clear what about some kind of ace jack not gut shot ace high beating bluffs having nut equity, and so on. So these are actually the only things that we need to worry about. And yeah, this is a reaction to Willem's sizing and maybe his follow-up game plan. And now I'm super excited how this one will go. So I want to start with a question first. Is that kind of clear? Just answer in the chat, right? A one for yes, a two for no clue. Is it somewhat clear what I mean with this graph? That looks good because now I will force you to use that graph in the quiz. Okay. So I hope 1.5 for you, Miguel is totally enough. You will crush it. I feel it. All right. So I give you 90 seconds now. So don't rush, right? Make sure to understand what I'm asking you for, because it's not like the perfect way of asking the question. And now I will give you a certain situation. The first situation is an ace king high board. Actually, let me look up which one it is exactly. So you can prepare. You will see it in a second again. So don't worry if you miss it. It's ace, king, four, rainbow, and we get a certain turn card. The action that happened was we did face a big c-bet on the flop, ace, king, four, rainbow, and we ended up calling. Turn is a certain card, and we face a 75% bet of villain on that turn. So we call a pot bet, and now we are on the turn and face a 75% bet. And now we have certain hands. And I want you to pretty much find the connection. It's button versus big blind. Find the connection between the stars that I'm showing. They stand for each hand. And I want you to link the hands suggested with those stars. I hope this will be clear in a second once you see it. So it's a puzzle, right? So the question is, pair up the hands with the stars in the graph. You have four stars. One hand is a very, very clear fold. This is number one. This is what you should put in the top. One hand is very close between fold and call, probably a mix in the solver. Put this as the second one. The third one is like the 100% call, nothing to think about. And the fourth one is one that, well, it's either a call or a raise. It's like in between, right? So find the right ranking, which of those four stars represents which hand. I hope that's kind of clear. You have 60 seconds from now on. And yeah, I'm super excited how this one goes, whether it's super easy or actually super tough i'm not sure myself so again we are defending the big blind versus a button open race we did call a pot-sized flopsy bet and now we are facing a 75 percent bet on that offsuit seven on the turn i mean i i put the numbers on the stars so the fold is the the one that is the highest here in the ranking. Number one should be on top, yes. All right. So, I mean, you only get the points here if you have all of them correct. Just let's go through them, right? Number one is the clear fold. Again, it's unfortunate that we don't see the board anymore, but that was ace, king, four, seven. The bottom pair. We call the bottom pair with the backdoor flush draw on the flop didn't improve on the turn every bluff still has over cards against our peer so it's just like we're not even doing great against villains bluffs we are not doing great versus villains value bets that's just the clear fault the ace eight is just well we beat villains bluffs we's value hands, right? Villain is not value betting ace six. So it's just like the kind of by definition, the zero EB catcher. Ace jack is way better because Villain could still value bet ace jack himself, maybe even some ace ten. That should be kind of the line. So ace jack is just a hand we cannot fold and there is no reason to ever raise And then we have the 5-3 that probably, I don't know, maybe some of you missed it, that this turned to be a double gutter. This is just a hand we cannot fold. It's just 5-5, but we are only facing a 75% bet, and our outs are just so insanely cool. Rivering a 6 or a deuce is a hand where a villain won't stop betting any of his value hands pretty much because we never improve on those hands. So it's just a hand that actually calling is plus cd with five high here in the solver. Maybe we can even just look it up, have it here. So ace king four, we faced that even like it was actually 120%. So I lied to you if that changed, but that shouldn't change much. We call any ace X, even though we hate it already. We hate already our life with Broadway gut shots. So if you are unsure about that, make sure to watch the video about facing c-bets out of position on the flop and making flop c-bets ourselves. There I'm explaining the big c-bet here on that board. But this time we end up calling. Turn was the seven of hearts. We check to villain. Villain mainly chooses that 75% sizing here. We see he value bets like ace-10+, pretty much. This makes the big difference between the ace-8 and ace-jack that you had as options. And now this is our reactions. We have the 4-6, which is the clearest fold of all times. We have the ace-8, ace-9, ace-6, random indifferent catchers. Ace-10 can already fold sometimes, even though villain is value betting ace-10 himself. Ace-jack is the clearest call of all times. And 5-3, yes, it is 5-5, but rivering a deuce or a 6 is just so magic that this is just perfect, right? The raises are mean we see six percent here it's the few king four it's the the slow play pocket force and that's pretty much it this was the first one i have a second one of those so i hope everything is clear now and we have another board so i show you the board already to speed up things there that you can use the full 90 seconds to think. I will play again button versus big blind. The board is queen, seven, three with a club flush draw. And actually villain will see that small on the flop this time. I force villain to see that small on that board, which should be the major strategy. And we won't check race. We will call. And the turn, I forgot the turn. I have no clue have no clue we need to find out we will face a turn and i think it's a flush turn actually and we will face a 75 pot bet again actually i'm not sure about the turn maybe it's the five of clubs no it's i guess it's the 10 of clubs i think it's the 10 of clubs so actually the 75 bet of villain again is is the sizing of his choice and our reaction is asked let's see let's see first see the ranking here who's crushing many pit jerome damien let's go so we have queen 7 3 10 of clubs was correct now i'm looking for a hand that is the clearest race of all times one that is close between race and call indifferent one hand that is the clearest raise of all times, one that is close between raise and call, indifferent. One hand that is the clearest call of all times, and one hand that is indifferent. And the one that is indifferent between fold and call, put it on the top. Number one is on the top, number two is second, and so on. The one that you want to raise every freaking single time is the one you should put on the bottom. Don't worry if you feel like this is too tough. It is really tough, right? So the next questions will be easier. No shame in clicking wrong things here. All right, nine correct ones. I think this is actually pretty good because this is a very special one. So the one between call fold is just ace-10. We have no club to go with it. We are behind villain's value bets and villain's bluffs still have good equity against us rivering an ace is not a great card either king jack getting there obviously clubs are not an out rivering a 10 means will and will just like shut down blue and red up yeah why why raising value all the time so yeah king of hearts jack of clubs it's not strong enough to just raise like what to do on if we river it clubs then do we still have a value bet with like fourth third nuts third nuts on a on a work card flush board i don't know what on on a straight it's just like raising is not cool but we have too much equity to just fold and we are actually ahead of some of villain's bluffs the king deuce of clubs obviously the strongest hands here being the second nuts but on mono boards we need to slow play quite a lot of things to just protect our range for the river this is the typical kind of 50 50 spot we raise sometimes and add some bluffs and we call sometimes to check jam the river ace clubs five hearts is kind of a special one here that gets check raised quite some high frequency on the flop already. And now it's the weakest ace of clubs that we are actually having high frequency. And this is just the perfect turn bluff, right? We are not really, we are still behind lots of value. We fold out lots of equity. We are behind lots of bluffs. We fold out equity. We have super nice playability on the river. We have not equity. It just just the one we love yeah we can't really check it's not just ace high we can check all ace high on the turn but not the ace five right villain might be betting ace jack with the jack of clubs this is something we fall out you might bet like ace eight with the eight of clubs so just for confirmation again let's have a look here we've seen already the turn betting of villain let's make that choice and now let's double check on our reaction and i gave him the ace five let's have a look bottom right ace of clubs five of hearts we're just raising every single time that's pretty clear you see it's already low frequency because we want to check raise that high frequency on the flop already that's the main thing we did have the king jack with the jack of clubs with the king of clubs we can think about raising as well you see that slightly here the jack of clubs is just the one you always want to call and we have seen the ace 10 no club it's just like the typical zero ev catcher it's like yeah you can fold you can call it's like whatever and the king deuce of clubs this is just how mono boards work we need to protect every street nuts won't change but sure they they can another club can be there but if we check raise now villainous problem unfolding in ace of clubs so it's like not changing much and then yes the board can tear up that's the only thing but that doesn't happen like very high frequency so yeah it's we need to have that in both ranges that's it pretty much this is why this will 100% thing. And yeah, maybe talking about the ace high, ace of clubs nine is a totally fine check call, right? So here, just showing we can check call ace high because what is villain betting? Villain is, for example, betting ace six with a six of clubs and another ace. So we beat that on lots of rivers. It's like check, check, we win. So this can happen. And this is the small thing. All right. So I hope you enjoyed that kind of guessing game with the graphs and already have a nice idea how you can structure your thoughts a little better in that spot. So anyone with two correct pit, MGL, Chris, awesome job. Yeah, this is for me a big help if we just really focus on those borders. Just everything in between seems like a reasonable call and this will be our main button to click on. All right, now let's get a little deeper. Investment and return. I made two slides for that. One is, I started with the headline easy version. I see that the slide doesn't look great, but whatever. The next one will be look too crowded. But anyways, that's what it is. Let's start with the easy version. On the turn, let's just think about the call-fault decision. Raising, again, is another door we could open. But we have the option to invest amount B. B just stands for billions bet size. And we have the following streams of return, potential streams of return. Where is money coming back? We make an investment. We want to get money back and we want to get more money back than what we invested. Like if not, we shouldn't do that investment. And one thing that is important is equity versus range that bets the turn and checks back certain rivers. Pretty easy, right? It's like, we know, okay, villain is checking back 50% on the river. We want to have equity against that. This river we want to have equity against that this could mean that we are ahead now this could mean that we are behind now but have equity against especially that when villain is checking back and so on right and then there's a second part second option right thinking ahead in the game tree villain is betting the river maybe like 50 of the times and then we need to make a decision again so we we can plan ahead. Will we have an easy decision, a tough decision? Do we have reads on that decision? In the end, it comes to, okay, we want to have equity versus the range that bats turn and bats rip. And we want to have the equity that we actually can make plus see the decisions, right? It doesn't help if we have 20% equity, but face a pot-sized bat and need to fold. That's not the equity I'm talking about. So we have like clear EV spots. This so far is something that reminds me a lot of what you guys wrote down in the opening question here. It's just like random words that don't help us. It's like, yeah, we need equity. Yes, sure. But like this bullshit, what is on this slide, does it help you to make an in-game decision, right? Like, let's call that, let's call it a session here. You go and play on the terms now. I need equity versus turn. That's what Stefan said. I mean, this is bullshit, right? Like it's not helping actually. So I want to break it down a little further. That makes the slide look crowded. The next one. But if we think about it, that should help a lot. So I explained that already a little little but now here it is in more detail boom forget the the table on the bottom right for now let's just go slowly with me through the bullet points the first option is villain has a bluff and he gives up on the river this gives money to all our freaking catchers right it's important that villain doesn't have much equity against our catcher maybe, right? That's the big difference. Whether we check call a bottom pair that villain has two overcards against, six outs, 12% equity, that's a big difference. Or whether we have an ace on an ace high board and he's just drawing dead, right? So, and then he gives up sometimes. What else can happen? Villain has value, but we improve and villain will check back. Why that could be something like, villain has pocket kings on a queen high board with a straight on the board and a flush draw and the river is like the straight completing flush card where yes, villain will check back his over pair and we win, but we won't get any more money of that. so something like that can happen next thought we know we have a plus cb bluff catch on the river this is kind of exploitative either knowing okay our uncertain cards our hand blocker wise or whatever just just really really great or exploitative this is just freaking over bluffing the river or he's super under bluffing and we like, this can be an upside as well to just know I never need to catch. It's just like having a good river opportunity. Something else, we improve on the river and beat river value bets. We could even go further there and say, okay, we beat river value bets, have a clear call, or we can even improve to a hand. Well, remember the 5-3 suited on that ace-king-4-7 board that we can check jam for value and get snapped off by lots of worse hands, right? We beat his sets, we get an in, and so on. So we have like insane implies sometimes. All right. So yeah, I added two more here that are not the typical ones to think about, right? One could be a plus cv-ripper check- check raise bluff. Could be someone who's just barreling too much, but then folding. Me, for example, if I play against like unknowns or like zoom 200 rack, I'm like trying to go for thin value, but I'm folding, let's say 80% plus versus river check jams. If you know that, you can make insanely good turn calls. Maybe some special flush spots or maybe not the typical face turn bet. It's like, I don't know if there was like bet re-raise and so on and ranges are quite defined. They could be like flush card comes on the river and you have a nice donking spot as a bluff, right? So this could be something that might be another returning straight. Might be okay if this happens, I can do that and this is plus a B for certain reasons. And this is kind of what we need to break down Thank you. that might be another returning string. I'd be okay if this happens, I can do that. And this is positive for certain reasons. And this is kind of what we need to break down in our head, just like to get closer to the correct, right? Because the problem with the solvers is everything is a mix in the end because the solver plays it that way and makes sure that no blockers are interesting, that nothing, no special lines are super be and so on and so on but in reality maybe a top pair with a certain kicker is just better and a top pair with another kicker is just worse right do i improve to two pair when villain will still value bet his over pairs then it's a better hand then let's say if i improve to two pair villain will check back his over pairs or he will improve to straights at the same card right so this is something that we could in our mind add up right obviously this is not happening in game that's more like a feeling but it's like when you think about it where is my main returning stream what am i looking for right so let's just have a look at the table now. Well, I just took the numbers that Ville bats the river 50% or so. And we have pot size just like 100 in the middle right now. So our investment, if we face a three quarter pot size, it's like 75. This is our investment. Every single time that we call, we lose $75. And now it's the question, where do we win that back? One of the main things could be that villain had a bluff, like of those hands that he's checking back on the river, he has like a give up bluff 40% of the time. That's just a made up number, just to have nice numbers in the end, right? So 250 is the pot size after the two bets went in, his bet and my bet on the turn. And 50% of the time he checks back and 40% of that, he had a bluff and gave up. So we win, right? That adds up to like 50% returning dollars here. Yeah. Not enough to make that worth a good investment, but we have more things. Let's say with equity versus villains value hands, but he will check them back, right? So it's like, we have a top pair with a like kicker so we have five outs against his over pairs pretty much something like that five outs is 10 this happens so often let's say villain bluffs perfectly on the river so we will never ever have a plus cb bluff catch with our hand okay nice right clear zero or we beat river value right so i just made that up that villain will bet another 150 on the river right so like we win the 250 pot in the middle and something of his 150 and yeah let's say this happens 10 as well right so we actually improve to something that beats his value but we cannot race so that would be another returning stream and all that would add up in that theoretical thing here to that right so don't be scared by all the numbers i obviously don't think that way but i think in those different columns in a way or rather rather rows here yeah it's just like am i unblocking his flush draws that he always bets and then gives up and i'm ahead of that it's like one clear returning. Say we could even think about that in a three bet pot where maybe a flush draws make a bigger portion of the betting. We're like, yes, this is what is happening for sure. And this is the first part. And then let's say I have nut equity versus his whatever, right? I have an open ender. So yeah, and he will bet when that gets there or whatever, something like that it's like okay how good is my out what is the difference between queen nine on queen 10 deuce and queen seven well i like queen seven way more because on a freaking seven on the river will and will still go crazy with his kings and aces and his king jack and so on is still nothing so it's like not i don't want to improve to two pair when this guy just makes all straights in this world right so stuff like that there's so much we can think into that all right so this is just a little theoretical example how we can split up things right this is something how we can learn to just make sure okay what is happening here where do i expect my ev to come from and And yeah, I'm not sure what's next. All right. Yeah. Second part of the quiz. Perfect. So now I will show you a couple of hands that I actually played and I made some decisions, not always the correct ones. I'm asking you for the correct ones this time. It's not the guessing game what I did. I asked you for the correct things. Readless. All readless right so for now we pretend that there is right or wrong in the solvable world but obviously in reality it always depends right and we want we will have another look late later an in-depth look at well how much ev do we actually have in those bluff catches right how how many hands are we having there that make a lot of sense to call with how much does the villain need to deviate that we can start over folding or calling all the time exploitative thoughts in general but now let's have a little fun in the kahoot i will jump back and forth in that one and the whole mental replayer so uh that i show you the hands first and then just ask you what's next pretty much. So let's start with, like, these are all hands I played the last month, and yeah, sometimes having tough decisions, sometimes having kind of nice decisions. So I would advise you to already, when I am showing you the hand, that you have that graph in your head, like where would you sort that hand into, right? Because now this is a rapid fire quiz where you only have 20 seconds to click the right thing. So villainous open raising, actually button, I guess that's a spot is calling. Anti-table, I call my jack ten off. I flop the world. Villainous c-bet's half pot. I can tell you I'm sometimes check raising. I'm sometimes check calling. Super deep. I need to be protected in all ranges. This board overall is way better for him having kings and queens all the time. And yeah, I prefer to check raise with a diamond. Just more equity and prefer to call with those. But in the end, it's an overall mix. Here, I did decide to call because I thought of that coaching and wanted to make sure to get it to that turn spot. We still have the super nuts and villain bats 66%, something like that. I don't know. Way too tough to do the math. All right. And now we have a turn decision. It's a great one, right? Usually we don't think about those ones enough, but obviously it's a very crucial one. We played 200 big lines deep. We have the nuts in a spot where villain is just super, super, super strong. All right. And now let's get to the question. How often do we call the turn? Do we call always? Do we call never, which means always raising? It's a mix or it's obviously a mandatory mint check raise. All right. So this is obviously the right answer is the mix. And here it's reversed from the turn. Now diamonds is not extra equity anymore. Actually, we love having a diamond to slow play now because then it's easier to call on diamonds and it's just way less likely that the diamond comes. Not way less, but a little less. And yeah, we want to fast play those here a little more. Villain can have a diamond of diamonds needs to call to ibarino i'm not sure whether you you confirm that one but we have the nuts we want to get the money in the middle and we take home all the cheese here guys so yeah favorite hand of the last month but it's obviously a mix on the turn we are still deep i have no clue what to do with the the river appears or is a diamond in either of the lines i I need to have everything. Yeah. So very nice hand to start with. Let's go to the second one. Button min raises. We are back to NL 1k. No anti-game. Queen nine off against the min raise. Very, very clear defend here. We flop a top here. One of the most typical spots, I guess, in poker here. We flop a freaking peer. He starts with a small c-bet. So far, so nice. We mainly check call. We can maybe super low frequency check raise, but check call is our option. Villain is kind of a brick. I have queen-do suited, two combos. I have three-do suited against the min-raise, three combos. I have six-do suited. I have four or five, which I mainly check raise on the flop. So actually, I don't have that very often. It looks nice that the straight gets there for me, but not really. Villain realizes that and overbets about 48% of the pot. All right. So what to think about? We have a top pair. We are not beating value hands. We have to evaluate our kicker. Think of the returning streams and facing the same question. Think already, where is that in your turn calling turn range graph? All right. So here we have a bunch of knits. Nice. I raised my kids nicely here. So actually this one is just too good, too good to fold. We have a freaking top here. The top here in the pie world is a call on the turn. And here we have like an extra special. A little special because Willem Minreist, he has a a wider range here actually and we have to think about how good is our freaking out if there is a nine on the river that's just so gold villain won't won't slow down in any way so it's just like way nicer than having the same hand on like a queen 10 board and so on so we have like probably i mean if he has four or five he has four or five okay right it shouldn't be too many combos but if we hit queen nine or a queen or nine win pretty often that's like 10 equity already we have the chance that he was bluffing and he should be bluffing and gives up a river there are certain rivers that he just has to give up where he's super over bluffing and then we have a plus cv river cash spot obviously it would be great to know that but yeah this one i actually didn't run in the solver because i i know 100 confirmed that we need to call that always but let's find out let's just simulate that a little with that sin that we are having okay here's a flush draw did we have a flush on the flop or on the turn i'm not sure let's just say he bet small on the flop on queen seven three we call queen nine would you ever dunk the turn no it's actually a break doesn't happen it can make sense in theory to use very very very small donks just to kind of fuck up hands like nine eight ten eight that he has but they still have equity against us But the simulations show that there's no EV gained, right? You can use that a little to mess up things or play another kind of game tree. But it's like, in theory, there's not really EV gained. So it's kind of unnecessary. It's an option, but I'm not using it. I love simplification. And this is what I mean with like, we just redo it. It's a totally different spot, obviously. But let's just have a straight here that I don't have too often. And kind of a brick turn. Let's get the four of spades out there. Dylan can overbet quite something. And here, queen nine is actually sometimes a fold. That sucks, no? But okay, I'm still convinced it's 100% call. But I hope that makes you a little more happy. Damn it. I could start you now for the reasons because there's a little more equity going on and so on and blah, blah. But yeah, maybe I'll look up the next ones. Right. Yeah, definitely. Right. What was the board again? No, I want to see the board again. And where was it here? Yeah. The flush draw is a different thing. That was a backdoor flush draw here. It's okay. I'm fine with mine. So anyone with a solver, make sure to make a threat and roast me in that one if you run that hand here okay so this is a little fly sketch can work for you i don't know i'm just guessing i was very very certain i didn't look it up so now i want to know someone open the threat please run that hand here but we need a button min raising range okay so make it like not 43 percent or something that we usually play make it at least 50 and then we're talking again okay so let's see okay next hand first the hand yeah and i'm a freaking calling station i couldn't help myself and all the folders are right because they always have it okay let's get to the next one queen jack i guess that's quite a similar spot here a little over the words at 2.25 x against random guy i know 3k i didn't know him at the time so no reads again we have that board villain uses a small c bet very small actually i have two over cards with the backdoor diamonds i think this is already close but i think it should be a call and let's go here. We turn a freaking top pair and face another overbet. Not 150% this time, just this year. Yeah. What are your thoughts? We have a double flush draw board. We don't have any of the flush draws. We have the turn top pair. Yeah. Let me know. Checked it in GTO wizard versus 2.5X range. 100% call on the turn versus 125, but mixing., so that, I think that's fine. Yeah. Just like with the wider opening range. Now I think we should be good with a hundred percent call. Just feels too strong. Okay. Now the queen jack hand on the double flush draw board against this, what is 125%? Again, we can argue this one after it. I didn't solve it. Just going with my gut. And I think this is just the same hand pretty much. It's, I mean, we should be valuable and could do that with like pocket sixes and stuff. Maybe even with the same hand. Obviously the flush draws that give up on the river. Our hand is just with the turn top here, way too strong. And yeah, I think we all agree here. If some nids want to find the fold button, I think in the real world, they are obviously correct again, because I river two pair. Villain uses the pot size bet and he has what he reps, but couldn't help myself. All right. Next hand. NL, what is it? NL 10,000? Right. So let's play this one here. NL 10,000 little heads up here facing a min raise. So heads up ranges now. Villain c-bets big on ace-nine-six here. We obviously check all, we have a freaking top here and top here is a great hand in heads up. I've heard. And we even turn a two pair, right? We do not beat any two pair and we do not beat the turn straight. So actually it's just, we are beating ace-king and ace-queen now, but we have a freaking two pair. So yeah, we face 80% bet. What do you guys think? What should we do here? How often do you call this turn? All right. So things are getting boring with all the calling hands I had here, but I mean, I'm not sure. Heads up. I admit again, but I think this is just way, not way, but too weak to check raise. There's not really a single rubber card we want to see that we are happily stacking off. And that's the first sign where just raising doesn't make sense as an exploit because his size is 80%. Yes, we can definitely talk about it, but we are living in the solver world right now. And here, a seven is shit, an eight is shit, a six is shit, a nine is shit. Hearts are shit, a king is shit, a queen is shit, and jack is shit. So it's kind of, yeah, what are we blowing the pot up for with a hand that we cannot go really for stacks? So facing river bat here. I love it. Yeah. So charging equity. Yes, in position, you would be totally right, Hugh. So, but here just we need, we could charge villain now, but in the end, we might be just building a huge pot to then end up in a horrible spot on the river. So we can already see that. And yeah, so I ended up calling here. We get one of the best cards in the deck. Face now an upsize to 95% and already hate our life. It's like, yes, we are in heads up. We can still value bet ace king, ace queen. But just, it's not like we are always winning, even though our hand is great. I mean, we are obviously calling here. I think raising is too thin. And yeah, seven, four of hearts, maybe. I i mean this is a clear call he has ace king and ace queen maybe potentially um yeah he had random bullshit i mean he had hearts i mean this is one that you should and need to give up on the river but okay right so maybe you can wrap seven eight and just jam here that would be fine i guess but yeah all right. Oh, is there, I guess, one more? I hope one more. So now I'm just showing this here a little longer. I guess all of the top five are still in contention with the next one. I have no clue how tough it is or... Oh yeah, there is at least a... Oh, there are two more. That's good. Oh no, fuck. I messed up. You can randomize. You see the action. I didn't show you the hand. You need to be really fast to win that one. Sorry for that. This is a special quiz now. All right. Actually, I ran this hand quite a while ago, though. Let's double check it. Okay. So a min-raise on the button. We defend on the big line. We face a big c-bet, 66%. We call. Turn is a king. We don don't have hearts we have a double gutter got most wrong but this one right nice and we face an over bet here our problem is we have not even six clean ones right so a queen is not an awesome out sure it's good out. Parts obviously shit we are not even beating bluffs so calling and then we are losing it's like i mean sure we are beating five six which should never check back the river but we are not beating something like maybe the queen five of hearts that gives up on the river so it's just like where are the returning streams rivering a jack and winning against something not really really. Rivering nothing, check, check, and winning? Like, pretty much never. Rivering a queen of hearts, hating life when facing a bet? Not the best. Not the best one. So it's actually like we are hoping for an offsuit eight and then some action, or an offsuit queen and then hopefully not an overbet jack. Versus 75, I think it should be the call-raise mix. Against 75, we can't fold, I guess. Here, I misapplied a little concept and went for the fold or raise. It's 100% fold here, guys. So here we were after a pile. I went fancy just to make sure that in case there's a river break, I have a nice bluff. In case there's a river break and a straight gets there i have a nice bluff unblocking hearts so now after making that turn punt i actually have a pretty damn good river bluff so yeah you see all the good calls led to me losing money the bad bluff led to me winning money so this is the beautiful part of poker and yeah but we still want to learn it's not that that I race here. It's just that I race the correct hands, right? It's obviously nicer if I have five, eight of hearts is a great race on the turn. Eight, nine of hearts is a great race if we missed it on the flop and we missed it to three bet pre-flop. Just stuff like that, right? Knowing a little how your ranges look like will help you a lot on that turns and rivers, especially well what is the difference between actually a six a three or a deuce like which hands are you having how do you evaluate your freaking top peers or peers with a random kicker on the turn right for me for example a 10-5 is a better hand on the turn than a 10-6 right with a 10-6 if i hit my two here my two-peer, 8-9 gets there, villain has an offsuit, big problem. 10-5, rivering a five, pretty nice. Just like, some little things that we can evaluate instead of falling for that emotional feeling of like, yeah, he cannot have it again, right? And just call and then whatever happens next. All right, should we stop shoving on river three of spades? I think it's fine as well. It's just Lillen will have enough hearts. I mean, I need some bluffs and the best ones are those that are not blocking hearts because this is what Lillen has for sure. Now here, it's very, very nice that eight, nine gets there and five, eight gets there. So I can even bluff a little more. I think we need to bluff here a hundred percent on the three of spades. We have an bluff. Okay, let's see now whether we have one more. I guess there was one more in the quiz. All right. Is this turn ever raised by solver actually versus that size? Absolutely. And this is very, very important. 10-7-4 king over bet. We have king-10, and the problem is, yes, Willen shows strength, but his range contains lots of hands that have good equity against our king-10. We don't want to allow that. It's important that we do not check jam here. It's pretty much us saying we have king 10 or king seven and you donkey have jack nine or queen jack. We charge you for that. So we can check raise to like whatever I did here. I think a little bigger is better. You can ask to Ibarino for the correct sizing more or less. And then we still have the option, right? We play our 8-5 hearts like that, for example, and then have the option to not bluff the river. It makes it way tougher for Lillen. It's not if he calls now and we have a bluff, he's guaranteed stack or something. So it's just, we want to keep that here. Maybe, I mean, it's a different thing. Let me just look up something, whether I have a board here that is somewhat similar. I mean, not really here because it's king now and like not 10 high and way less draws and weaker draws, but I just took our queen 7-3 and used the king on the turn, right? King on the turn, the link can obviously overbet. Now we have something like our queen 7 unblocking the king wants to raise instead of letting villain realize all the equity. Our king queen now, obviously, yeah, it's like against jack 10, we don't need that much protection here. The flush draw, okay. But you see here the king queen, just look at the king of hearts, queen of diamonds. The one without the flush draw is very, very happy to raise here, right? It's not a high frequency thing. We add up to like 3% here. I think on the board that we see here, it's way more that that king 10 suited will be about 50 50 in the ranges i'm pretty sure of that but yeah that's the reason villains hands have too much equity it's different on rainbow charm here we still have raises but way less all right so last hand to win the let's see the podium first all right now it's getting really close so good luck the next one i'll show you the hand first again i hope there's one more this one here king jack big blind versus button villain c bets over bet which makes sense if you think about my off-suit defending hands that's lots of king jack queen jack king queen 10x a7 ace 9 and so on i think his overbet is better on something like ace queen nine something like that where i don't have all the ace x2 pairs here i have all combinations of ace 10 and ace 8 offsuit so yeah big bet is good maybe overbet is a little i'm not sure right but yeah so here you could should already know hey king jack without spades is probably a fold already and the one with spade is a very very very close call so i do make the call here and the turn is a nine again we check and villain sizes down to something like two-thirds spot which makes sense right i improved to a straight i improved to even more two pairs what does villain do with ace king ace queen hands here? I guess they still want to mainly bet, but should be very, very close. And yeah, we have a decision to make. We have freaking king high and an open ender that probably doesn't have the most awesome implants. How often do we call the turn? All right. So we see a hundred percent call would be interesting. Definitely. I think this is exactly what Willen wants. Our hand is just too weak. Again, think about the returning streams here. All right. Like, okay. There's a queen on the river. Every jack makes a straight. Willen will check back lots of things. Okay. We sometimes get money in against the jack then. River is a seven. Every jack makes a straight. We are actually behind queen jack. That's very, very weird. And yeah, maybe with a 0%, I might be exaggerating. So you might be right, AOB. It's no way that 0%. Maybe it's like a 10% call. It's definitely, it's not that we fall all the time. I think this is the very highest frequency raising hand. I didn't solve that one. So I'm just going with, I think what I think is correct. So feel free everyone to solve it. And we all learn from it. But I think here by calling without the implied without, I mean, village should be bluffing something like pocket deuces here, right? So this is very, very bad his only bluffs are king five of spades we are doing great but yeah hitting our outs is not great and hitting our peers is not great either i think we have all queen jack off suits so we need to build a raising range here and having spades should be actually better than not having spades yeah i think that's mainly because that's mainly because the big size on the flop. Using the big size on the flop, he should have lots of the deuces, threes, fours, stuff like that, that actually can still have equity against our flop nuts, like our ace-10, ace-8, and so on against our ace-x, something like that. So the big size on the flop plays a big role here. Something like five, six of spades in that game tree is mainly a check back on the flop. So it's like really, if we only see the flush draws and so on, but it's tough to find the combinations here. There are not too many, but I might be wrong. Nice, like 80% flop fold on GGOist. Can you turn Jax? I'm actually not sure about that, about that with the spades. Just having a spade seems better to me because it blocks like clear continuations of villains that are sizing down here but if the one has queen jack of spades that looks exactly like what what he should do or obviously like yeah i'm not sure about jack or king better i think that's close but realizing that we open up a raising range here we have the queen jacks and so on and to add some of those with like yeah decent decent equity or decent stuff to go for them pure turn fault not even a race joseph you're what is the if you if you have it open in gto with one person race okay what's the turn race i guess we are raising some queen jacks right so what what is the the turn race bluffs here if it's not king King-Jack, add it in. Okay. Just the flush draws. Okay. I went for the race because I put him on Ace-King. But yeah. But cool. Very interesting. So actually the 0% call is confirmed. Little, little Jack-10. Yeah, that makes sense. Actually, King-Jack is just too weak. But yeah, shows again that maybe here I over-evaluated the King-Jack, how strong it is, to put it in the non-fold category sometimes. But yeah, very, very nice. Okay. I guess that was the last one here. Pit. I guess you, did you miss the last two questions? I mean, they were tough and who is it? D Tom. So congrats. We're not done yet. Just the quizzes done. So, so stay with with me but congrats on that but still there was lots of guesses lots to learn and yeah yeah very very nice that you that you have it there already pretty much and let's we have a little more to talk about let's let's keep going there and yeah one thing before we get to one i mean we had a little pile look already but to have one more in-depth look, I want to talk shortly about potential reads and exploits here, right? So maybe think of that here again. This is what was in my mind when really creating those bullet points. What can villain do wrong that this positive numbers increase here? So first thing I see here is the plus EV bluff catch opportunity. So here, there could be something like villain under bluffs the turn, which just means he always has it. That could mean, okay, our implights are better now because he might end up betting more often, or we could then even dunk, right? Typical nitfish type of thing. But the pure bluff catchers just want to overfold. Villain doesn't have the bluffs. So actually our returning stream of villain bets now checks back river with air and we win. It's just like getting closer to zero. That is a very, very big point. And actually the most standard one, right? When it's tough to find the mandatory turn bluffs, people will be too value happy. And that means we need to overfold. But now the more interesting things. Villain over bluffs bluffs the turn clearly we call it's important what he does on the river and to raise more as well if he over bluffs the turn we have safe fold equity maybe of one of the last coachings we were more talking about the rivers but there's just like the guaranteed fold equity if we think about what ranges are we attacking do we do we attack a range that is has made hands only and we need him really to fold 50 of his made hands where do we have the first 30 guaranteed oh yeah which depends on which hands use adorable high equity hands or low equity hands i imagine yeah since high equity hands are never real bluffs i'm mainly talking about low equity hands here right it's like having that 10-7 deuce king and villain is just going crazy with his queen five. Yeah, it's not bad. Definitely. I mean, it's more a definition thing. Is a flush draw a bluff or not, right? On the turn, still having 18%, maybe an added overcard. Sure, it's a bluff and hopes for villain to fold, but it's like not only a bluff. Okay, now one interesting thing, villain overbluffs river. That can lead to us calling more with a plan to call down this is the stream the returning stream off we have a plus cb bluff catch on the river right it's like we invest now on the turn because we get something back in like all the returning streams but we know one returning stream that where we have a read that is higher than it should be so this is a reason to call more and now actually which is a little paradox but makes a lot of sense hopefully as well as if villain under bluffs the river we can actually call more on the turn as well right it's just meaning okay he's checking back more often and we call now because we can have very very clear decisions on the river right we just over And if he's under bluffing, it just means he needs to check more often. He's missing plus CB bluffs, so he checks back. And we win with turn calls, river folds more often. So all that is something we can think about. So actually, if you have the note, it's never bluffing. This can be very, very misleading. I have lots of recreations I play against. I like randomly betting, but then they are honest on the river. So actually, I always need to get to the river. And then, well, I play perfectly and they just give up their six high where they splash two times half pot in there. So it's important that I stay in the pot with my bottom pair or something. If there's just the chance that he checks back 50% and has air. So it's just, yeah, the price on the turn, the investment we need to make to then know, okay, where is our money coming from? All right, one more example, one in-depth example where I showcase this year again, big blind versus button again, most centered spot. I just joined the action after the arrow, the action on the street before. Not really here. It's just what it leads to. It's the read we have on villain. Yeah, exactly. We have a read on villain and this is our correct exploit then. But I mean, the session will as always be on the platform within two days anyway. So maybe just check it in there from the beginning and it's a little more clear exactly this is all on same street or just reads right this is why the first two are about the turn like the last two are about the river all right getting to the last in-depth example um again button versus big blind the board we'll talk about is jack five four with actually different turn cards we can look at and we face a small c-bet and a large turn bet so now this is now my thinking i did that and i hope you believe me with all the stuff i told you before that i didn't look up tile right so here i made i just copy pasted pretty much that graph again this is what i want to look at this is what i think about the close spots what is close call and fold? And what is close between race and call? And maybe there are some hands that are actually close between fold and race. That's sometimes the case sometimes. And this is what I came up with next. It's like, okay, I started with my raising range. Should be very easy. What can we raise on the turn? Turn two pair. Very, very similar to the 10, seven something spot with the king on the turn where you just ask me in the chat are we actually having a raising range but here on the jack 10 is highly vulnerable we hate every queen every king every ace every heart every nine every eight every i don't know every card but we have the nuts right now pretty much right we beat his queens we beat his kings we beat his aces his ace four five, and so on. So important to often raise those. We obviously want to raise our slow played sets now with all the equity being around here. And then the addition to that is probably the flush draws without showdown value. And something like six eight of hearts seems reasonable. And maybe even the open handers. Some hands that make a nice hand when the flush draw breaks like if we have a three six left i think this cannot really call but hates folding as well so this might be one of those fold rays i just put them in there i'm i'm unsure and then i'm thinking about okay what are the close calls the hands between call and fold actually jack x i think is not a fold in the pyro world but they already suck right what about jack nine does it help us to hit nine not at all i feel like what about jack three we cannot even improve against it against any two pair i mean not against like jack high two pairs we hit a hand where will makes a straight with ace deuce ace three whatever we can have a random 10x we can have the 10x of hearts like one heart one non-heart what about 4x just a random card maybe maybe four with a nice kicker like a four seven now seven is not great either like i don't know and maybe what about a king queen just two over cards with a not straight draw this is like what i feel okay this is close everything in between we have five x of hearts we have not flush draw we have jack x with a solid kicker and that's about it against 150 we don't need to be a hero there too often so i think i have that somewhere let me just load that jack five four takes a second this is now really the what i do in game right just like thinking about my range here to have an idea right messing up left and right obviously but still having some structure in my thoughts yeah to somehow compete with like other people there so jack five four kind of high frequency small c-bet we obviously check raise quite a lot but this time we are calling again and we got the ten of spades on the turn there's no donking that's a perfect card for villain on that card villain should do lots of over betting because it's not only that he has the huge advantage now but that he will increase his advantage over time right like every ace king queen 987 is great for him so he's going directional in here a we see already, okay, we have like added up maybe 5% of raising. And this raising range apparently looks exactly like the one I just described before. We have the top two pair, jack 10. We have the slow plate sets. And then we have, okay, the 10.5. 10.5 of hearts is a fancy one. Okay. And then I love the out of position EV on that board, $8 in a $110 pot. So yeah, we have this. And then let's have a look at flush draws. It's mainly the flush draw plus gotcha type of things. 8-6, 9-7, 9-8, pierce versus 4X and 5X is that 6 outs versus 2. Can you a full sentence i have no clue what you mean i'm sorry yeah let's first first finish the raising range right the the ones like the weak like ace three ace two strong enough with the added gut shot here and ace high a six a seven seeing like sometimes a race king deuce king three and then the the ones with the added gut shot and no showdown value right and then now interested in what what happens to three six actually sometimes a race here we found one of the race or fold options that's then a cool one to to go all the way if hearts break right so i i just guess right so it's like if we race here and the river is i don't know a freaking nine of diamonds then we take our six three and put it in there this is already we have a raising range and now thinking about okay what is close and what is not close all right so actually we see and this is not important right we didn't talk about that so far this is actually where you can put the star in the graph where is it in the call area. So here we see we have a pot size of $110, if that is big enough for you to see. And now let's have a look at a random jack. This here tells you to call 100%, but actually it shows you the EV, which is $2. $2 out of $110, where if you overfall that, you're playing pretty close to optimal optimal right or in other words if villain is missing one single bluff you better overfold that right so this here is a clear villain is bluffing and giving up on certain rivers this is where the money is coming from and if villain is playing perfectly your hand is like very very very close to indifferent exactly christian yes sorry folding eights, but calling four X and five X some of them. The five X here actually are just the five X of hearts, right, because on the river at five, I mean, we have hearts, we have a five, so this is just equity. The four X are called by other like non-hearts as well, because if there is a four on the river, we won't have too many of them, right? It's not like we have all the four x flush draw so it's actually villain will invest more money so here our implants are a little better on that four and that makes them kind of break even pocket eights is just two outs or maybe even one out depending on having a heart or not not great versus an actual guy do you call catcher who gonna bluff the river maybe too much yes because i have I have the returning stream of the river catch, right? I might fold some clear turn call river folds, but those hands that can make a nice catcher on the river, I'm actually calling more often because then I need to make insane river calls maybe, right? But if I'm confirmed, no, that he's over bluffing the river, right? Let's just see that now. He over bluffs. Let's say I have a freaking king 10. King 10 is zero EV here. It's totally whatever. I call. And let's give us a brick. And now villain bets again, or maybe even over bets jams. All right, so he bets again. My king 10 is a fold, like minus $5. If villain is slightly over bluffing, right? Minus $5 in a $300 pot now. That's not much. If villain is slightly over bluffing here, this hand will get three hundred dollar pot now that's not much if villain is slightly over bluffing here this hand will get immediately plus cb all right let's say if villain is not giving up a random flush draw if he just blasts his king queen which i think is quite likely if he just keeps going with king nine offsuit offsuit combos right then yes i know i want to know where my money comes from right so villain bluffing more often on the river is actually a good sign for us. It's just the returning stream of we call now and hope for the check back on the river, that's getting less and less. So it's more like, okay, any kind of showdown value is nice and maybe the equity versus villain's nuts is more interesting for me. To win not only against his bluffs when I call down, but sometimes win against his value hands as well. All right. So yeah, this is kind of the structure in my head. Think about the raising range. This is the high EB hands right here. We are talking about catchers that either have $2 EB in calling or zero in folding. This is not where the money is. Start with the raising range. Jack 10, we talk about $110 in EB, right? So this is get things correct there. Here, obviously, raise and call and so on has more or less the same EB. It's just the hand strength. But still, this tells me that I want to focus on them first. And then step-by-step, the other part. If I know the bottom line here, everything else is pretty clear, right? If I know I call jack six, I don't need to think about my king jack anymore. So if someone is over bluffing on the river, we don't move some of our turn raises into turn calls. We would rather catch with our more break-even hands. And that's a good point, yeah? If we think in the vacuum, right? If we just, we play one hand, then it can make sense that our raises are just perform, our normal GTO raises are performing better as a call. But if we just we play one hand then it can make sense that our raises are just perform our normal gto raises are performing better as a call but if we think range wise let's start on the river right that makes it easier because it's like more black and white villain has it or not it's like if he's over bluffing i don't need to trap my nuts it's like because to catch him i don't need nuts like a fourth pair is good it's like that had a coaching lately with someone who was like, yeah, this guy, he was thinking about the bluffs with like the nuts on the river that were unblocking everything against the calling stage. We were like, what the fuck? How can you ever start thinking about ER here in villain's range? Like you have the clearest value jam of all times. You sit there, lean back, hope to get called. Whereas you have your close hands where you think like okay maybe for the close hands it's better to check call bluff raise perform better yeah absolutely right so if you have guaranteed fold equity there's lots of but again think about the borders first the crystal clear hands they will stay crystal clear right you won't start check raising here a random what could it be like uh king five of hearts you won't start check-raising here a random, what could it be like a King-5 of hearts. You won't start check-raising that. That's just doesn't make sense, right? Those are exactly, those are your cornerstones. And the borders, they are between call and fold. And those borders can shift, right? You want to raise a little more or a little less, a little more value-heavy, a little more bluff-heavy. You want to call a little more, fold a little more. These are the to call a little more fold a little more this these are the yeah the crucial decision points so now maybe doing that on the go one more thing for that jack five four here i will draw that again the thing we worked with today that little graph we're like here we see already we have like about five percent raise we have 60 percent fold because this is really bad for us and we have that call where obviously we now know that, hey, lots of our hands are here. And we are not talking about king eight here, ace nine, ace eight. This is all, no worries. We are playing those perfectly, right? They are right here in the box. And then we have lots of hands that are actually close, right? They look like a hundred percent calls here, but it's important for us to know about the EV as well we have jack two suited two dollars ev they are actually here jack three ace 10 right on the border king queen without heart or not sure all of them right on the border it's like all our hands are just like that and then we have something like jack 10 and we have maybe the pierre plus flashtra they they are that was not good they are somewhat here right to know your structure it's doesn't make a lot of sense to like keep thinking forever about those like if villain is playing perfectly this just doesn't make a difference nice like can you make a picture out of that dim i would love it so and then we have like some of our bluff raises here so it's it more like that, that that is not like, yes, spread in a linear way. It's more like we have lots of this where we can see it. We tackled that topic from the other side already, pretty much. Where the sizing is exactly chosen to, well, I use that wording to just like to fuck up most of villains or the biggest range part of villain, right? This is why villain uses 150%. If villain 75 looks more like this year we love our life we just call our freaking jack x price is too good right so here he really kills us and our jack x only has one two dollar cv 10x is like indifferent and some of the draws they hate their life as well so good job by villain we can only react this is yeah the reaction game and we want to do so still in a way that makes sense by looking at the borders first here this is our first step all right as always a little over the time let's get to the last slide here the key takeaways as always i think i repeated myself a couple of times already we want and we need to focus on the decision points that matter the most. All of you have now that graph in mind. Think about the borders. Everything else, there's like, it doesn't make sense to think about that. It's just crystal clear decisions. We know our cornerstones. Everything else is close decisions. We go a little to the right, a little to the left. And this is pretty much how we navigate through it. Very important when making those decisions is I want you to understand where the EV comes from exactly. And now as a second thing, how high it is, right? We call and we expect to lose. It's more like, yeah, we call and sometimes we'll check and give up a bluff. Maybe it's a full break and he gives up his flush draw. Maybe it's this, this it's coming from and then 10 of the time i hit my two pair or trips this is where parts of my ev comes from sometimes we hit this and that right and then maybe over the time we can find more cool docking spots the right trick jamming spots like just playing a river more correctly allows to play looser on the turn already right you can rely on more plus cv returning streams on the river so something like that and yeah super easy but that's just the key evaluate your hand and your villain correctly what is he doing over bluffing turn over bluffing river bluffing turn then stopping doing this or that starting with a too wide of an opening range min raising there having, having 55% first in, having 40% first in, and so on. Never bluffing river, but betting half pot all the way, all the time with any hand, something like that. And then knowing, okay, which category does your hand fit in? All right. And now the last thing maybe, remember the 5-3 from the first hand again. Ace-King-4, we face an over pot bet. We call our gut shot here. It's a pure gut shot. Even the 5-3 of hearts is 100% call. It's like some fold shown, but by the EV, I can see if I run the solver a little longer, it's 100% call. Queen-10 is not because that out is not so great. Turning a deuce is just awesome, right? So now doing the call, making the call, turn is a seven. We check, villain bets again. We can profitably call freaking five high just because the one returning stream we are having, which is revering a deuce or a six, makes up for everything else, for all the investment. We lose in every other case. We are are never donking pretty much now we can check on that what's the best card maybe a king or maybe i didn't even allow donking i did so it's like yeah no definitely not but it's what's happening a deuce comes check villain jams 33 that's with another eight percent yeah that's a nice overbet jam that we just sit there and collect every single time with our 5-3. And that gives us the positive return on our overall investment. But here we call the turn and know that we hope for the bink, hope for the bink, hope for the bink. And that's the only thing that is in our mind pretty much. And we know or can know it's kind of plus a B. All right. Have fun calling turns and have fun over-folding as well. If people are not bluffing, right? Lots of things to take into account. We are really deep in the game tree there in that spot. Need to evaluate. Yeah. All kinds of things. It's just super tough. These are the spots I review and discuss with all kinds of high stakes friends pretty much on a daily basis. So there is no right or wrong, or it depends. I think this, this image shows it pretty well. Yeah. Have a good one. And if someone wants to still post some screenshots of the hands or the Sims to the hands that I kind of messed up or not, or it was correct or not, I would appreciate it a lot. And then yeah, talk to you in the channel. See you next month for the next big coaching and yeah, have a good one. Bye-bye.
