### TOPIC: cash postflop flop 3bet ip
 In this session we'll take a deeper look at 3-bet pots and we'll start with c-betting strategies in position. We will take a look at different scenarios, what to focus on with the goal to get an idea which sizings and which frequencies to use to play a good flop strategy. Let's start with the situation we are in. Hero does 3-bet preflop and villain who is out of position calls. That gives us range-wise a certain input. Hero will always be unca, having aces, kings, queens in his three-bet strategy, while the out-of-position caller who did not four-bet usually does not have them or not at high frequency. So this gives us, on pretty much any board, equity advantage. Aces, Kings, Queens is so strong, the flop cannot change that much. So actually on most boards, those overpairs still count as nuts in a way. And that makes us keeping the nut advantage on almost any flop. Now the next thing to focus on will be the nut advantage over time. That might change. Sometimes we don't care too much which cards will come next, and we know we will keep our nut advantage. But in other spots, we really scared to see some more cards because it might turn things around in a way. I'm a big fan of divide and conquer so I actually take all those three bad pots and divide them into smaller subcategories and I do that by looking at the strategies I want to apply. So let's start with spot number one that I chose today. This is the spot where Hero has nut advantage now. We said we pretty much always have equity advantage as well and hero will keep nut advantage over time so this is a spot where we are crushing now and we are not really scared of anything that might happen to well be in a worse situation so actually those boards where we're super happy about the flop. That will allow us to push equity with a very very high frequency c-bet. Our advantage is so big that we can just invest money in the pot gaining fold equity and getting value from villain's calling range. So let's think about which boards could fit that description. For the examples today I will be using cutoff versus MP examples where I'm in the cutoff and raising a linear strategy. It should be about 8, 8.5% from aces down to the pocket sevens, eights. We will see that in a second. And out of position, we'll answer with lots of frequency calls. And we are just seeing a classic solver range in our examples. So let's take a look. Remember, I only split up the spots by looking at the strategy or certain parameters that are just true for those boards. Not advantage now, not advantage over time. I brought three example boards today. And the first one, King 9-4 Rainbow, on the very left side. I offered two options for seabed sizings with the goal of finding out what is correct, what is the favorite seabed sizing that the solver chooses? And to think about the frequency I can use it. The first sizing is quarter pot, a very very small sizing. The other one is 55% that I offered just to check out how much is the solver interested in a bigger sizing. Let's take a look at K9-4. We see, hey I don't even have to show you the frequencies here in numbers, we see that this is a full range bet and the only sizing that makes sense for the solver is the small one. Why is that the case? Well we have such a huge advantage. We give villain lots of trouble with that small bat. He has pocket 8s, pocket 7s, 6-7 suited, ace-jack suited, ace-queen suited. All those hands have trouble already. We'll start making use of our nut advantage at a later point because we know we will keep our nut advantage. If the nuts change on the turn like a queen, jack or ten that's not great for our ace king or our aces obviously but it's not a big problem because we will have those new nuts as well. We do have queen jack suited, we have some jack ten suited, ten suited we have tens jacks and queens so that's all good for us second board king five deuce monotone all hearts in this example we have more suited aces we have nut flushes even more, which gives us the big advantage here, is we have way more offsuit hands. In my solver output, villain never calls ace-queen offsuit out of position. So the runouts, keeping nuts over time, are actually pretty great for us. If there is another heart, well, we will add even more nut flushes that villain will not add, for example. And if there is no heart, that's all cool as well. Our advantage is so huge. And with a small bet, we can attack everything that doesn't have a heart, pretty much. Whether it's pocket eights without a heart or ace queen of clubs it's a very very effective bet to put out there we could now think about what is the perfect size and could we even go smaller that would be a next step to find out but for now this board fits into that category a small c-bet at high frequency makes a lot of sense. Let's have a look at the next sport, queen 10-4 rainbow. It actually is somewhat similar to king 9-4, just a little bit more connected because of the queen 10 and how close they are. So we might think that big sizings make more sense now, but actually small only is totally fine for the fact I mentioned before already. We have the advantage right now and we will keep it. If the turn is a king we have ace jack, if the turn is a jack well great we have ace king, if the turn is an ace well we have king jack suited. So actually when nuts change we will cover them so nothing can happen, nothing bad can happen to us and it's fine to just push our equity and build a little bigger pot to then polarize later and go for the bigger value bets with our stronger hands and bluff with our weakest hands. Let's talk about the second spot that comes up. I think I don't need to mention that again but we have equity advantage pretty much always. In the second spot we have nut advantage as well but have the problem that we might lose nut advantage over time. So what does that mean? Thank you. nut advantage as well but have the problem that we might lose nut advantage over time. So what does that mean? It will force us to bet big now just to get the money in before bad stuff happens and just to make sure we build the pot as long as we still have those advantages. Maybe think about which boards could that be. We have seen now some boards where we see that very high frequency with a small sizing. Now we are looking for boards where we find reasons to not use a small sizing but to make use of our advantage right away. And just to show you a couple of those let's start again on the very left. 10-4 deuce rainbow. It's one of those brick boards I call it. Villains shouldn't have deuces and fours with a high frequency. We don't have it either, but actually it's like as if there is not even a flop. So advantage is there right now right here jacks queens kings aces plus all our hands that missed the flop still have 25 percent against every pair six over cards plus backdoor straight draw potentially backdoor flush draw So the flop situation is great. That can change in two ways. If the turn card comes, villain can improve to new nuts that will help him. There can be a 5, villain has 4-5 suited, maybe even some ace-3 suited. There can be a 3, villain has 5-6 suited, ace-5 suited. There can be a 9- villain has five six suited, ace five suited. There can be a nine eight seven or six which means at the one hand villain will add sets which makes it easier for him to defend. But the biggest problem is actually that villain gains knowledge about how our weaker hands do. On the flop king queen is still a strong hand but on a turn nine eight or six well the nine is fine right but eight seven or six it's actually just well a six outer seeing one more card now which just got decreased in value by a lot so we have a spot here that is great for us on the flop, but will often change on the turn. And this is the reason why the small bet is not a thing here. We only take the big bet. I only offered 55% as the big bet would be the next step. So now we have learned only big on that board and now we could find out well is it better 50 75 maybe even pot and take even other things into considerations exploitative things how do we think villain reacts here do we make his life easy actually by choosing a certain sizing or do we make it tough for him alright next board actually it looks very different but it's the same thing i was just talking about a brick board we see deuce deuce deuce here so actually c-bet frequency is a little lower on that board that is because well our over cards just are not having that nice connection with a 10 well and we obviously don't have the top pairs that ace 10 and king 10 provide so actually that is a little worse for us that board but the strategy stays the same we have the advantage now we want to make use of it now every turn might change things while tens jacks and queens super nutted right now, they won't be on a king or a queen. Which is not the biggest problem because we cover those cards well, but on an eight, seven or six, well we have just way too many overcards that did not hit. We need to make use of our advantage now, of our position that villain does not know the turn card and does not know how to react here. Alright, third board, Jack-9-5. Still rainbow here, but we see, okay, the big bet is it. And why is that the case? Well, just think about you having a strong hand here. There are lots of turn cards you don't want to see. A 9, an 8, a 7, a 6, a 5. Well a 10 queen changes nuts but we cover them that's not the biggest problem. And well we have the over peer advantage again. Queens, Kings just want to get the maximum of money in now. So to wrap that up, three examples that are similar in a way, even though they look very, very different. We have nut advantage now, but villain might catch up or we might lose even that nut advantage over time and this is we want to make sure to get the money in now so for now we have seen two different spots that in a way are actually similar high frequency c-bet one time with a small sizing where we keep advantage time, the other time with a big sizing where we want to get as much money in right now as possible. Still high c-bet frequency. Obviously there are boards that are kind of a mix between those. If I don't go for the jack 9-5 but I go for the queen 9-5 for example well we see a big mix between small bet and big bet and that would be the next step where we decide what makes sense. But for now this is about the understanding. Both bet sizes can make sense there and I want to understand the reason. Now coming to a very, very different spot. I could show you lots of in-between spots, but I'd rather talk about them when they come up in the live play or session review. Because we learn way more from the maximum examples, from the extreme spots. Let's get to spot number three then. And I only wrote down one thing here. Villain has nut advantage now. Now what does that mean? We've discussed that in a couple of the other videos already. Action-reaction game. Check it out in the general concepts. Once villain has the nut advantage he shouldn't be range checking anymore and actually he should be incentivized to start the betting round more often even though he's out of position and he's not the aggressor. He has the reason to build a pot so what does that mean for our situation? We need to understand that not we are setting the parameters anymore, not we are setting the framework, how the pod is played out. It should actually be villain. So what I wrote down here is it forces us to switch to reaction game because it's just a standard thing for people to be doing even though villain might be checking a lot but then we are in the exploitative part again. Now it's just important to understand hey we are in the reaction and we are reacting even though villain is checking to us we need to know whether he did check 100% because he doesn't understand the spot or did he just check this time but has a strategy that includes betting as well and I want to show you that with an example as well remember we are still three betting from the cutoff and the middle position did call And what we see here for the first time is the decision for out of position on the flop before it was our turn in position. I chose the board 7-6-5 rainbow and offered only a small donk as an option. I just stated again What is the fact. Villain has nut advantage. More 7s, more 6s, more 5s relatively. More 7, 6, 5, 6, 5, 4 nut equity. We have our overpairs. That's good equity. But is it really nuts on that board? Close. And villain should take over initiative is what we see here we see a 38 frequency dunk that is often not happening as i said and then we need to switch to exploitative strategy but it's so important to understand that we cannot say what the perfect seed batting strategy is here because we are actually reacting to what villain does and to showcase that i ran two simulations for you one time villain does play with exact the donking strategy we are seeing here and another simulation where I didn't allow villain to donk. So I know he is range checking to us, which I guess lots of people are doing because it's just a thing to check to the aggressor from preflop. Let's compare those. On the left side you see the correct c-bet strategy against a range check villain has nut advantage so once he's checking all of those hands he obviously still has that nut advantage so we are not too incentivized to build a pot we see 18 percent betting big four percent betting betting small, whatever let's say 20% bet total. Actually I'm not finding a single hand but sevens and sixes maybe that want to bet more often than 50% frequency. And let's compare that on the right side. On the right side I offered villain to donk which means if he does not donk his range is a little weaker and therefore in that spot we want to build the pot a little more often and with a little more I mean actually more than double that right. Not 20% frequency we bet with over 50% frequency here because it is a very very different spot and our c-bet strategy is nothing else but a reaction to villain's strategy he started with. Let's wrap that up again. I showed you three different kinds of spots and I want you to take that away from this session. What do you need to focus on? The first two spots I just explained through nut advantage right now and or nut advantage over time. The third spot was a special one because we learned actually even though we are the aggressor as the three batterer and it gets checked to us we are playing a reaction game reacting to villain's strategy in the first place. We talked about which sizings make sense when big or small. I leave it open how big or how small. This would be the next step to find out whether there's some clear advantages of certain bed sizes on certain boards. And another next step would be how can we simplify if we want to use both small bet or a big bet? Should we do so or should we decide to find something in between to make our strategy easier? Which brings us back to the concept of building a wardrobe. Simplification. Making it easy for us while making it tough for villain. Lots of things to think about. Next step is the video where I review three bad parts on the flop myself. We'll have a look at lots of different spots and how I approach them. And this is hopefully where you can take even more away to then use in praxis as well.
