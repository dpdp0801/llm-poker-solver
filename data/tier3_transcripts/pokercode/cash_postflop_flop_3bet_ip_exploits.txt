### TOPIC: cash postflop flop 3bet ip exploits
 Let's talk about the exploits we can do when we think about c-betting in a 3-bet pot as the aggressor in position. And I can let you know right away, there's not a big difference to single-raised pots. It's the same situation. We have most of the time a clear advantage, we build the framework and villain has to make a decision between call, fold and raise. That's it pretty much. So let's take the detailed look at it anyways. Villain has the option to defend too wide or too tight. Villain can defend too passively or too aggressively, check-raising too often or not check-raising enough. Villain can have leaks in the future game tree, continuing poorly after calling a bet, after check-raising, after it goes check check and then choosing wrong sizings when it's villain's turn to take over the initiative. So as you see it is exactly the same thing as in the single raise pot. Just one thing is different. We are playing tighter ranges and that makes it actually easier to think about it. We don't have to think that general. We can really talk about the combinations that we are attacking. We can say something like 10-4 deuce rainbow. If I bet big, villains middle peers are already indifferent to be calling the the baseline. But I know villain likes to call them at 100% frequency. So we are talking about one clear category of hands and we'll come up with the exploit against it. So what we could do now, the same way like talking about exploiting in general when it was about the single-race pot-end position. I could just now go through lists to see okay when do we adjust our frequencies, when do we adjust our sizings. But I think that would just come back to doing the same thing again. You can apply everything that you've learned in the video about the exploits in the single-race Thank you. back to doing the same thing again. You can apply everything that you've learned in the video about the exploits in the sing raise part as the aggressor in position. You can apply that here as well. If you didn't see that so far make sure to check it out as well. And here in this video I want to give you some examples of my favorite ways to exploit in the 3-bath part Let's stick to the way I divided the spots So let's talk about spot number one Let's remember that that was the spot where we have the nut advantage right now and we will keep it over time. And our strategy in all those spots was to bet a high frequency with a small c-bet. So the first thing that I'm doing as an exploit very, very often, I'm not betting high frequency. I'm betting 100% frequency instead. One of the typical mistakes I'm facing, and that might be wrong one or two or three years from now, but right now, people are not check-raising enough. So I realize my equity. On boards like Queen-104, K9-4, K5-2's monotone, all that, I'm just c-betting full range. And the beautiful thing is I don't even have a decision. While I make it super tough for Willen to continue, he might even know that I do that with all my range. But still, the beautiful nut advantage I'm having makes it so tough for villain to play against me. The second exploit I'm using on that board is wall. Quite obvious given the same read. If people are not check-raising enough, I need to make sure to get the right amount of money in the pot. So instead of check-raising, people are probably calling their gut shots and open-enders a little too often instead of check-raising them. But those hands, they call without looking at the sizing too much so I'm range betting with a small sizing and I call that exploit I cheat with some hands so I'm betting my full range with a small sizing on that board but I call it I cheat with some hands and just choose a big size instead. Let's talk about an example. Cutoff versus MP, queen 10-4 rainbow. We have seen in the video about the fundamentals how that flop strategy looks like. It was only bet but villain should check raise quite aggressively there with his King Jack his ace Jack his ace Queen even some 10x which a lot of people are not doing so they will call those hands instead and the first thing I will be doing is just size up with the hands that are vulnerable. Those nutted hands that want to get the maximum in now. That can be pocket kings. That can be something like ace queen. That can be something that actually dominates all the calling hands without really being a value hand. Something like ace king. So I try to find a mix there and that is one of the exploits I'm implementing in my game very very frequently. Let's get to my favorite exploits in spot number two. This is where we have the nut advantage, but we might lose it over time. Our examples have been 10-4 deuce, deuce, deuce, deuce, very, very brick boards. Jack-9-5 rainbow was another one where just lots of those cards in between with a straight connectivity would hurt us in a way on the turn. So there same thing again people are playing poorly often against the big bet there. Against that big bet there is actually not too much check raising allowed so it's tough for people to be under check raising. the main read i'm having there is that people are actually calling too wide imagine facing a c-bet on 10-4 deuce in this spot your pocket 9s 8s and 7s are already indifferent calling or not but people having a pocket peer and no overcard on, I just a 10 but no broadway card besides that on the board no king no queen no ace I see them clicking the call button at 100% frequency what will that lead to well they pay too much money in general on the flop with that hand category. Now we have two options. We can even size up our flop sizing, which would be one exploit to make use of them paying. Or we have to think one step ahead because people are not calling super wide. Down there is my experience. I i say it again that's my personal experience in the games right now that can be different in a half year from now or in a year from now but right now i'm pretty pretty sure that this is kind of a thing so the exploit i like there is actually not cbet bigger bigger but c-bet at higher frequency. We have seen a couple of spots where it was 70% c-bet and 30% check but I'm already planning ahead of double barreling a lot to have increased fold equity on the turn. Every light call that villain makes on the flop will be an additional turn fold and increase that frequency. So actually I'm talking about the flop because I increased the betting frequency here but the real exploit is over two streets maybe even three streets. Another exploit I like a lot in the spot number two is to just choose different sizings and manipulate villain's range that way. Often that will lead to a small sizing with hands that should actually check at high frequency. Ace-King, Ace-Queen. I can bet that small instead to give villain a chance to check call his King-Queen high, his Ace-Jack high, to keep dominated hands in and leave room for wall turning a setup, rivering a setup. The same same time, I can do that with pocket aces. Those hands are missing in my big bet then, and this is, in theory, the problem. And this is why I choose it against weaker players, where I know they answer by calling and just look at the sizing in their hand. Let's talk about spot number three as well. That was the one where villain actually has not advantage. It means he should start setting the framework for the pot. It's not an automatic check for him. But now we're coming to one concept that will be at some point a concept itself within the general concept section. I call it sizing or action triggered by hand. What that means is just that villain looks at their hand and then they come up with the idea of doing something. So here it is tough for lots of low stakes players especially to realize how ranges play and their brain tells them oh I did call a three-bet out of position so I auto-check the flop and this is what they do whenever they miss the board for sure. When they flop something that connects well it changes something in your brain. You flop a set then you realize oh that board is interesting and you think about it even more maybe you've even heard about that that this is a good board to donk on. Maybe you look at something like a gut shot, 9-10 suited, you don't want to, you're scared of check raising, check calling makes it a little awkward, so you start donking to attack in positions king queen as it is totally correct. But what does that lead to when action or sizing is triggered by just your hand well in this spot it will lead to value heaviness pretty much always because my read is or how i understand that concept is that people will come up with that idea once their hand fits to that board if they have queen 7-6-5 without a flush draw or backdoor flush draw, they will be on the auto check not even thinking about it. So how can I exploit that? Remember we are in the reaction game. We react to a stronger batting range than there should be, which means we will raise less and we will fold more. The other thing is, if Willen's batting range is stronger than it should be, his checking range has to be weaker. So I actually like using a small sizing on those boards as well. And actually see that higher frequency than any solver would suggest me. You can exploit me, re-exploit me easily there, by check-raising a small sizing. I have random overcards all the time. But this is the next step and kind of a tough exploit to implement as the out of position player. So now summarizing that up again, we are in the reaction game. We have to get an idea how villain is playing that spot because he sits in the driver's seat in spot number three. So now we've had a look at my personal favorite exploits in the spots I prepared for you. Now, what is the question for you in game? What do you need to focus on? First thing for me is always awareness. Which spot am I in? maybe you can come up with another system of cutting down your personal three batting spots. But then think about those as individuals and learn from that. Are there any population tendencies you know about? Is there any specific read that is quite obvious for some players? Then, think in combinations. Time is over of just general thoughts. You know hand categories. Three bad pots are tight. How is villain playing these specific combinations or those specific combinations? Make use of the knowledge you're having. And then the probably easiest advice there is when it comes to exploiting. Make villains life tough. Think about what he doesn't like. If he is full of shit because he did something wrong building his ranges, attack him with a small size. If he has hands that always like to call, go for a big size in a value heavy way. And now enjoy the live section where I talk about a review of three bad pots, how I played them and how I thought about them. And then I would like to see you discuss all the potential exploits in lots of different spots in Slack together as a community. I'm really looking forward to seeing some great ideas there.
