### TOPIC: cash postflop flop 3bet ip hand review
 Welcome to the Praxis part about 3-bet pots in position building a c-betting strategy. That spot is not that often so I cannot guarantee this spot coming up when I'm playing live so I decided to just make a review and you might have seen some of the hands already in the live plays when we were talking about raise first in, big blind defense and building flop strategies in position in the single raise pot because this is where I took those hands from. I think it's 13 hands and I just want to take you through my thought process on the flop. Which sizings did I use there? We will see that. What is the frequency that I'm actually c-betting there with and how do I structure my range in a way? So let's jump into the action and see what comes up, right? So I just show Willens hand as well if it's there. It shouldn't be too distracting but yeah let's go let's talk about that spot classic three bet button versus mp flop is 833 remember in the theory part i talked about mainly three spots one where we want to use a small c bet where we have nut advantage right now and we will keep that advantage over time. And the second spot which this one fits to perfectly is where we have nut advantage right now but things might change over time and this is not only because villain picks up nuts but mainly because our king queen for example right now is still a strong hand with four outs to the nuts and another two outs while the flush gets there then but to a good top here but once we miss the turn villain will see that it's quite obvious which cards we are hitting so we want to give him trouble now this is was spot number two where we mainly use a big c-bet spot Spot number three was where we actually end up being in the reaction game because villain has advantage and should start donking from time to time and we need to evaluate whether he did that or not. Obviously when he does we see it but if he checks we need to figure out was he checking a hundred percent or just 60 percent and the other part is dunking because this tells us a lot about his range all right talking about that hand i'm c betting half pot only on that board we can take another kind of big bet 65 70 everything is fine we cannot go full frequency because we have too much shit. We cannot see that all our king, queen of diamonds, but that would be the first exploit against some people who cannot defend properly and that end up folding at some point. Then we can increase our see-ed frequency while actually keeping the sizing big. So I go with a half pot seabed. That's it, full flop strategy. Regarding the overcards, I look out for having clubs and spades just to have either some equity with the club or some blocker value with spades because villain is obviously more likely to continue with spades. So the ones I'm checking back are mainly those with hearts and diamonds. Okay, now on the turn, we start going directional in, polarizing here. And yeah, I don't want to talk about the turn too much. It's just part of the hand and I know how much it hurts to not see the end of the hand obviously getting it in here he has a random bluff catcher which is a fine call I guess and yeah let's go to the next one under the gun open raises and I have a classic three bad ace Queen off middle position versus early position again we're having a pretty linear range here and get this board 10-4-3 actually that fits pretty well to one of our example boards it is again spot number two one of those brick boards no one hits which means we keep the advantage us having more jacks queens Kings aces and all of them are nuts villain shouldn't have too many threes or fours maybe he's not even open raising them or then he's folding the majority of them to the three bet so perfect one for us where again wall the 10 gives connects a little with our over cards so we have a little equity boost here and we can go even higher frequency. My wardrobe, my framework for the flop looks like the following. Just half pot again. That's my simplification. This is my bigger bet than three bet pots in position. And now is the question, how close to 100% betting frequency can I go? I don't like the queen of clubs just not connecting with a board at all but I think I can still bet very high frequency not saying that I'm on a hundred percent here but very very close to it. So I end up betting half pot here get the expected fold Villain has sevens eights nines can't do a shit suited broadways can't do a shit Perfect perfect spot for me seeing that flop. I'm super happy even though I have a hand that obviously missed Alright next MP, 4-5 suited, kind of a frequency 3-bet. 100% is too much, never is not often enough, so this is fine. This board smashes us. That's just, yeah, villain has all the pockets, he can't do his shit, he has suited broadways, he can't do shit. Obviously sometimes he has a queen or a king, but we will find that out. So this is very easy, huge advantage, this is clear spot number one, we have nut advantage right now, we will keep it over time. I'm c-betting full frequency, even pocket jacks, right, that might look like a natural check all hands that i have in my range i'm not even thinking about anything else i'm betting quarter pot the small sizing give villain trouble with pretty much almost anything he has in his range and that's it i go with my four five suited as well and we'll have like 50 fall equity here so that's awesome next spot again pocket kings nothing to talk about pre-flop mid stacker here potentially weaker player king 10-3 interesting right so now which spot is that it is kind of spot number one. We smash the board. We have nut advantage now. We have kings. We have ace-king. We have aces. And we will keep it over time because whenever the board changes, well, flush, we will make lots of flushes. We have suited aces. If it's a jack or a queen or an ace, we will those straights so there's nothing that can really hurt us. Now is the question which part of villain's range do we want to be attacking? He has those pockets we attack them with a very small sizing they can't do anything but villain has something like 10x as well pocket jacks ace ace jack. They're happy to call a small sizing so maybe we can charge them a little more. And actually this is one of those sports where villain should check raise quite a lot to put the pressure back on us because we have ace queen, ace jack ourselves. And yeah, so one exploit that I was talking about in the theory videos was actually if people are not check raising enough well i need to take care of building a pot myself so this would be one of those spots where i'm cheating a little and move away from the small range bet and bet some hands that are interested in doing so just bigger to get more value out of 10x out of ace queen out of ace jack so those pocket kings are out of question a small c-bet I want to keep villain in the pot I don't fear anything and yeah unfortunately we get the fold. Okay next one ace queen off nothing to talk about pre-flop ace nine five board very very interesting lots of people think about range betting here because it's an ace high board and the aggressor but where is our actual advantage is it having an ace more often not really we have more ace king than villain okay but we have kings we have queens we have jacks more often so this is where parts of our advantage is in those hands mainly Mainly want to check back in a way. So I stick to a small sizing on that board because I want to attack villains random broadways, villains pocket eights, sevens, sixes. They can't do too much. So I stick to the small c-pad here, but I cannot go 100% because I have a big part of hands, big part of my range that is not interested in building a pot. That wants to check down maybe one small street at some point. Ace-Queen then already is a mix that I sometimes want to check back. I think here I went for the c-bet, definitely going with a small c-bet. Villain starts check-raising, right? Does have pocket 9 pocket nines does have pocket fives he can check raise ace king can have six seven seven eight something like five four nine eight whatever right as five outers i'm calling and on that card i'm actually just folding because i know i'm not like that high up in my range i have ace nine suited myself i suited myself. I have pocket nines myself Obviously ace-king is stronger because he might have ace-king himself Yeah, but okay. That was my flop strategy and it's important when facing that check race that I know what my actual flop plan was Next one ace-king hmm interesting board that definitely smashes villain's range. And first thought, I have to admit I'm not 100% sure. I have the advantage of queen's king's aces but how nutted are they still? Villain has high frequency nines, I don't know how much high frequency jacks, definitely has sevens and has lots of high equity hands like maybe eight nine suited nine ten suited jack ten suited king queen suited the flush draws yeah all that 10x 8x even tens and eights so it makes sense to just push my equity because i have all those broadway things as well But what do I really attack with that? I don't see too much. So I somewhat like a big bet as well But putting out a big bet against someone who is super nutted often on that board Feels like a big donation. So i'm definitely not c bettingbetting 100% here and I will actually mix. Or this would be something I would look up next thing to see, okay, which sizings does the solver prefer and for what reason? So the more I'm thinking that villain might check raise, the more I prefer the small sizing. But the more i think he answers by calling if i'm playing a weaker player a more passive player well the more i like the bigger bet to get the value in now with my pocket queens against this ace jack against his pocket tens against this eight nine if he calls those and then i can always when the board changes dramatically i can just check back and call it a day pretty much so this guy we were on nl200 i expect to be more on the passive side so i went a little more with a half potsy but i think i did that here if i remember correctly yes and he ended up folding so i'm happy about that what does he do here with pocket eights what does he do with ace queen what does he do with even king queen against the half pot right it already hurts so I feel like I gave him some pain I'm not sure whether my strategy here is perfect but as long as it somewhat makes sense within my reasoning it can't be that bad okay we already see villain's hand let's see pocket queens oh that will be it ace eight eight we have talked about ace nine five it's actually i mean not the same board it's way drier right there's no six seven suited there's no seven eight suited there's no five outers like five four before so a villain either has an 8 or he has an ace or he is full of shit pretty much so a small bad high frequency can work out very very well here too but our queens and kings and maybe ace 5 that category is not really interested in putting money out there there's no equity equity to be denied. Villain has two outs maximum pretty much. So why should I open the betting round here instead of just going direction showdown? And that makes a lot of sense here. Just checking down pocket queens on that king. If it breaks down, we might have a small value bet on the river, not with the king on the turn so I'm just checking down being happy to win. But the flop strategy was important, small bet only, not 100% frequency was my plan. Okay, cutoff versus MP ace jack off this time. Pretty similar abort to the ace-9--5 now actually a flush draw as addition and Broadway gutshots as a little change so yeah hmm like that boosts our equity but gives villains stronger hands as well we have all the Broadway's villain has all the Broadway's that's the change pretty much where again a sideboard is probably not 100 frequency given the equity boost with us having more broadways it might increase our seabed frequency the connection between the 10 and the 6 actually is not that great for us so i'm kind of of indifferent. I can see multiple sizings here. Again if someone is not check raising I prefer a bigger sizing to just control the pot in the direction I want it to go. If villain is check raising quite aggressively I want to decrease the debt money I put out there. Ace jack definitely fine as a bet or as a check. It's not that high up in our range given that we have all ace-queen off suits, all ace-king off suits. We do not beat ace-10 so actually it's like whether we have ace-jack or ace-9 it's pretty much the same hand. Yeah I'm not sure whether I did check or did c-bet here but I tried to explain the reasons. so yeah and now it's a a clear check on that river i mean we have a catcher against the big bet but i think it's fine to let that one go okay a couple more hands pocket jacks it's a three and a half x a 35, so definitely being on the exploitative side here. I mean, Jax is always a 3-bet, but we play against a probably weak player, so I don't have to think about strategy of my overall range too much and just play my hand, given what my read is on passive 35.9 players. And here, well, I think it's just we try to check down and win somehow and fold if he bets big. So not much strategy talk here. Ace-King again, middle position versus early position. We get a cold caller from the big blinders, so that makes it a special spot. We are talking about one specific spot today, so I'm not looking after the very special hand histories but still let's just pretend we were heads up. So what is that board? Pretty much that board is just an ace out there. Like Willem shouldn't have really deuces, not really threes. 4-5 suited, maybe open raising. 24-19, he doesn't seem too loose. So maybe he has a low frequency. But actually, I see that board as there's just an ace and nothing else. And now again the question, where are my advantages? One of my advantages from preflop are that I have kings kings and queens what would they want to do probably check back they they are interested in getting one street in betting now would just fold out all hands that have zero equity or just two outs so i'm not that interested in the other part of my advantage is ace king right so i'm clearly building a range around ace king i want to get all in with ace king make use of my advantage is ace-king. So I'm clearly building a range around ace-king. I want to get all in with ace-king, make use of the advantage I'm having on that end. While villain might have all the ace-queen suited, ace-jack suited, perfect. And now the next question is regarding sizing. How do I attack villain's range best? I think it's clearly a small bet. It's like I don't need to attack his ace-x right away so I'm just attacking his jack-10 of hearts first I'm attacking his pocket eights so I'm starting off with a small bet let's forget the big blind here Willem calls turn is a nine sure he can have pocket nine sometimes he can fold them some frequency on the flop as well so whoa let's just again forget about the big blind but i'm playing ace king versus ace queen ace jack i'm starting to polarize now and go directional and okay now this spot is special getting two calls again first forget about the big blind again, that 5, does it change anything? Well there's a one card straight, but can villain ever have that? Ace-4 suited, opening under the gun, calling the MP3 bet, doesn't fit to a 24-19 guy. Four-five suited, sure, but might check jam on the turn. So, ace check, ace queen suited. It still is. So I have a very, very clear value bet here. And actually now thinking about that spot that we see here with the big blind, why should it change? He would probably check jam his nines on the turn. He can have a random ace queen over call, just predicting that he's a fish in a way where should the fork come from they are definitely having ace x of hearts but maybe i would check back if i have ace of hearts king because well i mean in in tishanu's shoes here i'm folding ace jack and maybe ace queen even sometimes on the turn given that goose core is batting into two people on that board where someone definitely has it or has something and yeah but here i decided to still go for it face two folds but yeah pretty clear spot for me and pocket queens. Again, against someone with a mid stack. Yeah, I just have to assume mid stack, zoom 200, probably not the best player. So let's have a look at the flop strategy here. Again, ace high board. We have reasons to be checking with kings and queens. We have reasons to be betting to push all our equity ace king ace queen is not nutted here they are not interested in stacking off ace jack pocket jacks pocket nines all the draws obviously and again i make the decision here between betting a lot or betting even bigger depending on how passive or aggressive villain is is he ever check raising something like jack 10 here is he check raising king 10 with somewhat high frequency or is he just check calling that if he's just check calling that i love betting even queens and kings just get that money in now against the peers that call once and then check down instead of checking it down then i keep the initiative c turn and river pretty much for free and yeah this is what i decided to do here and then just check down hope to see jack 10 and king jack here and he had ace eight suited that's all fine let's see very easy next spot if i remember correctly button Button versus cutoff, ace, ace, five rainbow. And yeah, now two aces. Well, now the ace is not that interesting and actually having kings and queens and jacks gives me a clear advantage over all his pocket peers. So that's actually a very, very good board for me. And yeah, let's not think about it too much much this is spot number one and we see that full frequency here a hundred percent just give all his broadways trouble there we go nothing to talk about five six suited button versus mp against a somewhat loose player Jack, Jack, eight. What is that? Well, for me, this is a clear spot number one again how many jack extras villain have not too many so this is just yeah i have all the advantages and i'm even connecting with that jack eight a little we could find some reasons maybe for sizing up as well against passive players but I stick to 100% c-bet small sizing here 5-6 suited definitely does the job easy money and that was already the last one so these were just a couple of hands from the last sessions where I was in that spot mp cutoff button in position I could say three bet pot in position but I actually see big blind versus small blind as something different because it has a very different range structure so in those 13 14 hands i guess now we have experienced lots of the thought process i'm having in game thinking about which spot am i in how do i attack villain in the best way try to think about the exploitative side as well is he more on the passive or aggressive side how do I build the pot do I have to do the job myself or can I rely on villain participating by check raising that tells me how much money to invest in the end I think we didn't have a spot number three and I think that is totally fine because it should just show you well most of the time we have the advantage we keep the advantage we have the advantage we want to make use of the advantage and this is why I call that one of the money making spots. Having position, equity advantage, not advantage, initiative what else do you want master that spot try to get in that spot discuss that spot with the community in slack and yeah enjoy printing money there
