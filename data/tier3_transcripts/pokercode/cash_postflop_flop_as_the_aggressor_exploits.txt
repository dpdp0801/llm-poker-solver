### TOPIC: cash postflop flop as the aggressor exploits
 Let's have a look at the potential exploits we can be doing on the flop when we get there as the aggressor. To do so, we obviously need to check out first what Wilm might be doing wrong. Wilm has the option to answer with three different lines. He can either fold to our c-bet, he can call, or he can raise. So what are his options where he can make mistakes? First of all, he can continue with the wrong amount of hands, which means he can either defend too many of them or not enough and therefore over folding. So far we were not talking about which option he is choosing to continue his hands with. This is the next point. Even when villain decides to defend the somewhat correct frequency overall, he might choose to take the passive or the aggressive line too often, therefore check raising too much or check calling too much. And one more thing that you do not see right away on the flop, but is one other thing we can think about already. Is leaks that villain is having in the future game tree, which means he can either overfold versus a double barrel versus a triple barrel. He can have problems in the delayed game tree when we check back and he checks to us again. maybe he has leaks there and we know something about it. Okay, so far we have talked about what is villain doing wrong. Give you a little reminder, the three questions I'm using all the time. What would be right? We talked about that in the fundamentals and created a way to get to sizes that make sense that we want to use. And now we figure out what villain is doing wrong. Now coming to the third question, what is the right exploit? To get to that, we need to first think about what are our options, what can we do differently, where can we adjust and so far we have built our wardrobe and can now deviate in different directions. We can either increase our betting frequency or we can change our sizing or switch between sizings if we have multiple ones. So let's take a deeper look at each of those options. First thing I'll talk about is the c-bet frequency. When should we adjust that? One thing that is quite obvious and not a secret is well we make that exploit against players who overfold if people are overfolding we gain ev by c betting wide by c betting with air by c betting with hands that need to deny equity this is direct ev we are winning the pot that is in middle. So this is actually the easiest one so we won't talk about that too much. Now the second point where could we adjust CBAT frequency is against players who are playing too passive. So it might be the case that they are defending somewhat correctly but they are not check raising often and mainly just defend by calling. What does that lead to? That leads to us realizing equity. We can be sure to see the next card without paying an additional price for calling a check raise. So this can be very good for our medium strong hands or backdoor hands that we would need to bet fold or fold later at a certain point. So this is where we can adjust our c-bet frequency. Obviously, the less common thing in my games is that people could be check-raising too wide, being too aggressively. Then we would need to cut down our aggression and adjust in that direction. And now the third thing is where we can adjust the seabbet frequency is when we know leaks in the future game tree. Especially I'm interested in the delayed game because this is where we find lots of spots where we can get the so-called zero equity EV. We don't even need a good hand to gain EV there. but if there is a player who always bets when he has something on the turn after I check back on the flop and his checking range consists of mainly air, well what will happen? I will save a bet against his good hands and have incredible fold equity when he checks to me on the turn again. So even in the games I'm playing, you see players who are folding 70%, sometimes up to 80% versus those delayed bets. That is the easiest EV we can grab and should decide to c-bet a little less to make use of Villain's League. To show you a little better how that adjustment overall works I came up with an example. This is an example where we open raise the button and the big blind defense and the flop comes down 9-5 deuce rainbow. Remember a flop that we talked about in the fundamentals already as well where I decided given the graph it can make a lot of sense to use a medium sizing or even a very large sizing because villain doesn't have nuts really. So here what I did to find out how we could adjust in seabed frequency I went for a huge simplification and only offered Pio solver in that case the option to seabed half pot. So on the left side you see the solver simulation the suggestion how to play if half pot is the only option. Thank you. So on the left side, you see the solver simulation, the suggestion how to play if half pot is the only option. I left lots of options for the turn. I offered villain to check-raise everything. So this should be pretty close to the truth. If we are just using that one sizing. We see that ends up with about 70% frequency so what did i do on the right side i asked the solver a pretty clear question and this is exactly the exploit i've been talking about i asked what if villain is too passive with defending what happens and what i like most is to really go for the maximum i don't want to put down hey instead of 15 my villains are only check raising five percent or seven percent and see the perfect answer i will never nail it there anyways but i go for the maximum and the maximum here is i don't allow villain to check raise I'm just assuming he's not check raising at all that's not true either but it shows us how far things can go so that's the only parameter I changed on the other side here on your right side and that leads to that significant increase of c-bet frequency and we are almost betting our full range right even the hands that prefer to check clearly which we can see on the left side ace 10 offsuit ace 8 offsuit they just go for the c-bet at a very very high frequency. The reason behind that is the better equity realization we are having. Because we are guaranteed to see that turn card. The next option how we can adjust is through bet sizes. So there is again a very very obvious one. If people are over folding we can c-bet more but we can exploit that and increase our risk reward, make it better for us is what I mean, by c-betting a smaller sizing. If people are not interested in continuing with hands where they did not really hit the board, well then we can minimize the amount we are risking. Let's just think of something like king king three. Does it make a difference against overfolding people whether I c-bet 30% or I c-bet 20% or 15%? Probably they already clicked the auto check fold button when they are sitting there with their queen nine offsuit so this is something that is quite obvious but still to think through every time on the flop we can find a certain sizing and start exploiting here. And then the second part brings us back to the last example pretty much. Let's assume villain is too passive again, not check raising enough. So that is usually seen as a good thing. We realize more equity, we see the cards for sure, but for some hands that is actually pretty bad. Let's go back to that 9-5 deuce and have a look, right? And think about nutted hands, something like pocket fives. We have the mid set. If we bet small and villain check raises, this is perfect for us this is the spot we are loving but if he's not check raising that often maybe we are losing ev here and our only chance is to take care of the size of the pot ourselves this is why i put down here size up your nuts and your nut draws. That is not necessarily flush draw or anything, but something that wants to build a pot. And let's have a look at the Pio Sims there as well. I'll explain it to you the same way I did before. It is the exact same board, just that I offered two bet sizes this time. On the left side again, with the check-raise possibility for villain, and on the other side, on the right side, we see it without the check-raise option for villain. So where is the difference? First of all, the two sizings I offered are half pot, which we used before as well. And the other one is actually an overbet, 125% of the pot I went for. The pot here is the regular size of when I open raise on Zoom 500. So if you look at the numbers, $28 are in the middle. We have the options of betting 14 or 35 here and you see on the left side that actually as predicted with a graph with the line graph we were talking about before that the very big sizing makes a lot of sense especially for those hands that are nuts right now but won't stay nuts over time first First thing that comes to mind is pocket tents. It is the freaking nuts now but once there is a jack, queen, king, ace, eight, seven, six, nine, five, any card right changes nuts and gives villain lots of better combinations than those pocket tents. So that's the first one that wants to get the money in right now. Whether that is by betting small and getting check raised or by betting big itself is not the biggest difference. And now you see what is happening if we take away the check raise option. We see what we've learned in the last part already,abed frequency goes up dramatically. But what goes up as well is the big bet that we are using. So all the nutted hands, let's keep an eye on those. Pocket tens, still some small bet on your left side. On the right side, always wants to go big. But the even more nutted hands, let's have have a look there pocket fives we were talking about actually on the left side it likes to bet small to keep more hands and to get that check raise from here in the middle and on the right side well there's only one option really pocket Pocket fives, pocket deuces, almost 100% big bet. So let's summarize that. We need to take care of the pot size ourselves if villain is not participating in the aggression play too much. So make sure to bet big when you have it and you don't expect villain to raise too often. Okay that's actually it for the flop because these are all the options. We can change our frequencies, we can change our sizings. That's the two major general exploits. And I showed you by just that one example, how we can learn more about incentives, looking at one specific board and using that max node locking to get an idea how to approach it. So the next time you're in that spot I want you to think all that through, build your wardrobe, find out what would be the correct option for your hand, think about potential exploits, think about which read you have on villain to then know the right answer how to actually play in the end. This is lots of things to think through and there are not many standard plays out there if we keep thinking everything through. And now I advise you to check out the live play where I try to do exactly that and play the perfect way I think, an exploitative way, against the players I have certain reads or no reads on.
