### TOPIC: cash postflop flop as the aggressor fundamentals
 Welcome to the very first post-flop theory lesson that I'm recording. I chose the flop as aggressor fundamentals as the very first topic. This is part one. I have no clue how many will follow. I can just tell you that it was really tough to break it down to get it done in one session. So there is lots of more stuff that we will talk about on the flop. But today I want to start with very general stuff to get started. So let me make that clear. This is one of the most common spots. It is one of my so-called money-making spots because we have initiative, we have range advantage and we have position. So it's one of my favorite spots to think about because it is one that is just so important. I see the flop as a restart of the hand every single time. Preflop ranges do not matter too much anymore because everything changed now. So the first thing we need to be doing every time when we get to the flop is to evaluate how the ranges play for having a general impression who is the boss in that spot are we playing the action or the reaction game most of the time that's lucky for us in that spot when we open raise and the big blind just defends which will be what we are talking about today we will keep our equity advantage. Villain won't have aces kings queens and other very strong hands and the flop cannot change things that much that we lose this advantage. The next thing which can actually change is the nut advantage right now. Double check on what is nuts right now, who has more of that. And then even more important because the hand does not stop on the flop. Is the nut advantage over time? Take a look at the board. Think about what will be nuts on certain rivers. Are there straight draws? Are there flush draws? Is it super dry and your flop nuts will always stay nuts? This will change strategies quite a lot. after having made up your mind and having that general impression, who is the boss in that spot? It is time to think about strategy. I would advise you right away to go in the upper section regarding general concepts and double check my videos about building your wardrobe because this is what we are going to do now. I'll just summarize that quickly again. Before thinking about my actual hand I want to cut down my options to choose from. So I need to find a way how I find out which sizings do I want to use and how many sizings I want to use to then in the next step finally look at my hand and decide which of those options I want to choose this time. Now we'll start with me showing you a little helping tool, how I get to that, how I'm thinking, what is going on in my head when I think about flop strategy. So now we have a general impression how ranges play, but now is the time to decide which sizing or sizings we want to use. So to do so I use line graphs. If you don't know what that means I will explain it to you. So what you see here that small graphic on the right side is a line graph and that represents range parts with lines and the general question behind that is just how much is villain ready to pay that's all i'm asking myself i cannot order things like on the river just with showdown value. I need to include draws, flush draws, straight draws. What is the better hand? Tough to say on the flop, but we can have a general impression. If we are jamming, villain won't fold the set. If we just go all-in. But if we do that, villain will probably not call a random queen high flush draw. If I bet pot, he will call every flush draw. That's just, well, some experience, so this is not scientific. But it helps me a little to put his range into an image that I can then use to come up with better solutions and better strategy. So have a look at that graph. Just think about certain range parts that I made a line for. On the very left side I might make a line for certain combinations that villain would for sure fold to a min bet. So let's have a look at the first line here. That might be 5-6 offsuit on ace-ace deuce. Might be another hand, right? Might be 3-4 suited on king-10-6. Just I know even if I bet the minimum, villain will fold that hand. Then the sizing increases. I keep like pot size bet somewhere in the middle. This is just an orientation. And then on the very right side, it's really just if I'm jamming now 100 BB into that 5 BB pot, what would villain be calling? What we see here is actually a very very linear range. That means it does not have gaps. Villain can react to any sizing I'm choosing. I know that might be confusing in the first second, but I'm sure you will get it over time, 100%. And I'll give you a couple of examples to make that clear. Let's talk about an example. I just chose one board that fits to that very linear representation. Jack, 10, 9, rainbow. I didn't even say the actual spot. Let's just imagine we are button versus big blind. So the bet which is i'm thinking about villains range here the big blinds range if i was c betting the minimum what would he be folding this line could be representing five six of hearts but three four of hearts as well or three four of spades but something like ace four offsuit would work as well so this represents a couple of snap folds the more they are the more lines will be there and then we can go a little further up a hand that will definitely call a min bet but folds to a bigger bet might be eight x of hearts something that definitely calls a half pot bet but not a pot bet could be 9-6 right a weak third pair something like that or what about queen 5 it's probably calling 75 but would it be calling an over bet well and then in that board we have all kinds of nuts as well. The big blind will have king queen, will have queen eight, will have seven eight which won't be folding. In between where we don't know well whether that is calling an all-in or just a very large bet and then there's a threshold somewhere might be the two pairs and obviously there's lots of that medium stuff queen jack queen 10 9 8 queen 9 all that type of stuff which is represented by lines in the middle somewhere so i hope i i made that somewhat clear i know it's tough in the beginning but i want to try that with you and give you an example now without telling you the board. So you only see the graph. Example number two, guess this flop. I'll try to describe it a little. We have lots of lines that fold to a min bet. So So they are meant that all of them pretty much fold to a min-bat, right? It's just, it doesn't look good if I just put all the lines on one spot. Then there is almost nothing in the middle, no medium part, but villain is clearly not protected. So if I would be jamming he would find his calling hands. Maybe take some time and think about it. We will talk about it a little later. And now one more example where the graph looks actually very different. Example number three. Try to guess this one as well. What is different here? So first of all we don't see any folds to min bets pretty much. It's tough to find a hand that wants to fold if we just bet the minimum. Then there is a large group of hands that are ready to pay like half pot, three quarters pot, pot, maybe up to 1.5 times pot. But then there's this huge gap. Villain does not have any hands that are really happy to call, let's say, two times pot, three times pot. Just a theory, right? And actually calling all in just very, very, very few nuts. Think about that as well. Maybe you could come up with something that is pretty close. So we'll have a look on which boards I had in mind in two or three slides. But now let's talk about why it is okay to actually just look at villain's range and therefore i want to talk about the beauty of a linear range so what happened so far we open raised the button we did open raise a linear range villain defends the big. He does not call his strongest hands because he's three batting them. That leads to him having a calling range that is capped in a way. He cannot have certain hands. And I want to make use of that post flop. So I have that linear range and now the beautiful thing that every linear range once it still covers the majority of boards will stay a linear range on any board. Sometimes we are lacking some nuts. Think about low straight options. Maybe we don't have 7-4 suited when that makes the nut straight but we will always have top set we will always have mid set we will always have bottom set when we open race on the button we will always have aces as the overpeer we will always have kings as the second best overpeer etc etc so it's not possible that there are gaps and what does that mean for our range we are personally ready to find hands that are ready for playing for any amount right if we want to bet half pot we will find hands that want to do so if we want to bet pot we will find hands that want to do so if we just want to jam we will find hands that want to do so as well not a problem just turn things around and imagine if villain was donking with certain sizings would you really ever have a big problem? We said already most of the time we keep the equity advantage so we have hands. Sometimes we have problem regarding nut advantage especially with nut advantage over time but this is not the problem for now. so now thinking about hey our range actually looks the same every time if we just look at the structure no matter the board sure sometimes a little weaker sometimes a little stronger but the structure stays the same and understanding that helps you to just well make up your strategy by looking at villain's range and search for the problems he is having. So now the big question, obviously, it's all cool and nice with those graphs, but how do we get to the sizing? And I talked about that already. so you look for the gaps because these are the hands that villain is not having. These are his trouble spots. This is where he cannot react, where his range is not linear. So I love the word attacking something because it makes clear that we are fighting. And now take Take the graph and think about range parts. Does villain have many snap folds? I call that range part number one, his snap folds. Does villain have many medium strong hands? Range part number two. Those are hands that call depending on the sizing. Sizing elastic calling hands. If you bet small he will continue those, if you bet large he might fold those. And then is villain nut protected? Keep that in mind. Every bet we are making is a donation into villains nuts. So if villain has nuts very often we don't want to make too many of those donations. So those three questions keep those in mind very important and now let's have a look at the boards that we were talking about before where I let you guess. I hope you wrote down something. The first board I had in mind was KK3R. So let's have a look at the graph again. Don't get confused by the red line by now, we'll talk about that in a second. On the left side we see all the snap folds, all the Jack 10 off suits in the world. Jack 9, world jack 9 8 9 ace 5 maybe even not a snap fold but close enough queen 10 7 8 5 7 whatever then in the middle this is represented by those two small lines there's just a little something right villain has pocket fives pocket sixes a three okay that's really not too many combos compared to their other stuff. But then again, Villain is super not protected. He does have pocket threes, sure. And then because blockers are a big issue on those boards, he has just enough king-axe. I could make the lines a little further away from each other to represent that he has king-seven, king-eight, king king ten and maybe lacks ace king at some point. But I don't want to be that precise even. So that structure of the board is he either has trips or nothing more or less. So let's go through those three questions. Villain has lots of snap folds. Villain has almost no medium strong hands but villain is not protected. so now the question is which sizing makes sense? and here it's pretty clear. well i give him trouble if i bet small. he has all those snap folds so he has two options either he continues with hands that are actually not ready to continue or he over folds which gives me direct ev every time i'm full of shit anyways so that's just a pretty logical one here betting really large just on the flop doesn't achieve anything and now coming to the red line that just represents the bet size. I said pot is somewhere in the middle, min bet is on the left side. So this should represent some kind of 25, 20, 30%. We can discuss which is best there, but I'm just saying small and then it's actually doesn't matter too much. this shows what are we doing we are attacking that gap right every line on the right side of that red line is ready to call happily but those are not many right this is here in that graphic five lines every line on the left side of the red one is not comfortable defending. So this is actually seven lines here. I mean this is random how I drew it but still should show you. So if villain really reacts in that way he's just folding a lot and this is what we see on that board. So, so far this was KK3. Let's get to the next one. And maybe some of you have guessed it already right because this is my personal favorite board that I keep talking about quite often and this is 952's rainbow. Let's imagine button versus big blind and take a deeper look again. What is different here? I was saying they are pretty much no snap folds. What's the worst hand that the big blind is having here? You either have an over card or some kind of backdoor straights at least. There are no under cards, there's no fold trash, it's just no. If it's really a min-bet you do not really want to fold any hand but then you have all that you have all the six sevens you have all the jack tens as two over cards king jack king 10 queen 10 this is all that middle area you have five x deuce x ace highs whatever and then let's have a look at that gap again what do you not have you don't have tens you probably don't have nines you don't have jacks queens kings aces that's lots of combinations and then what usually helps the big blind is two pairs having the wider range overall so i was looking for a board here where the big blind does not have off suit two pairs 9-5 suited two combinations hearts and diamonds 5-2 suited if you defended another two combinations plus deuces plus fives That's really not a lot. And now let's have a look again at the three questions. Villain has no real snap folds so first thing does a very small bet make sense? Maybe for other reasons but not just for the bet itself. Villain has a lot of medium strong hands. I would love to punish him for that to use big bets. And our villain has, well, almost no nuts, so he's not nut protected, which means, hey, then I can go big because I'm not donating into his nuts. So what we are seeing here is a medium size makes sense, a sizing that hurts all of villains' jack tens and queen eights and king sevens, over card plus backdoor straight, all that kind of stuff. That makes sense. I represented that with a red line in the middle of the pack here. And then a very big size makes sense. Let's say we overbet that board. And if you want to put it in a solver, you see that and this is the reason i represent that with a very big line villain has deuces fives nine five suited five two suited that's it in the big blind range that is very very wide so what happens hey you can overbet your pocket tents get called by nine x get called by 5x which we all know that feeling probably feels like shit facing that bet on the flop and if that is the case we did a good job choosing our sizing and you see i could keep going and going here there's so much more to talk about on the flop but I think this is one topic itself that is really important to understand. Now you are ready to build your own wardrobe, to understand which sizes can make sense and then build your continuation strategy. you can decide yourself do you want to use all of those sizings that could make sense or do you simplify to just take one and the check back or just two bet sizes or go for a range bet in certain spots to keep it simple for you and now to wrap up that topic let me just summarize things again the graphs you have seen are graphs that I used, that I came up with to improve my own range imagination. To go from graph to sizings I really think about those three range parts snap folds, medium strong, nuts and this helps me every single time to come up with a strategy for the flop by looking for gaps in villain's range he does not have certain hands that give me an advantage on almost all boards i want to know where that advantage is exactly and then looking for that I want to build my own wardrobe i am deciding what's happening it is action game i decide the framework villain can only react and this is what i want to achieve
