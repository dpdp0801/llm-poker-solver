### TOPIC: cash postflop flop as the aggressor fundamentals 2
 The flop as aggressor. Talking about the fundamentals part two. In this video I'll try to build on what I've showed you already in part one and we'll take you a little deeper in my thought processes on the flop. Actually we will look a little ahead on the turn already and take that into account as well. But first, let me summarize quickly what I've learned so far. we will look a little ahead on the turn already and take that into account as well. But first let me summarize quickly what we talked about in part one. I did show you certain fancy graphs that I use to describe and to have a better imagination of how ranges look like postflop. The flop is always a restart of the hand. It's not a given thing that we are just like having all the nuts and way more of that than villain because we have aces and kings. Well, it is often, but not always. So we took those graphs to showcase where are villain's problems where are his gaps that we are looking for looking especially at those hand combinations that villain cannot have and knowing already that us having a linear range gives us all the possibilities because we can choose from any sizing our range is always linear in that spot we have top set mid set bottom set we will have all the over pairs in between so take this as a given thing and then then go on from there to finally build your wardrobe So we figure out sizings that make sense in general because they hurt villain. We show him where his troubles are and yeah we build our wardrobe and we do that in a way that depends on simplification and maybe personal taste as well. We can go with range bets, we can make one sizing and checking strategies, we can use two or three or four sizings. It gets more and more complex but if this is your game tree it's totally fine. We are in the action game. You are the boss in this spot. Choose what feels best for you and gives villain at the same time the most trouble. To build on that what we've learned I just want to present you one example to go a little deeper there. So that example is again the spot that we open raise the button and villain defends the big blind. That means he does not have aces. He shouldn't have kings. Never ace king. Especially on that board where all the high cards hit here. Villain has lots of trouble. I tried to showcase that with the graph that I always use for imagination. On the very left, you see some that describe Villain's, I call it part one, his snap fold part. Even the smallest bet he's folding. I'm thinking about 10-9 offsuit, Jack-9 offsuit, Queen-9 offsuit, 6-8 suited, all that kind of stuff. No matter how much I bet in position, Villain will fold. Then there's a little gap in between where there's not really anything and maybe a queen high backdoor flush draw is still interested in that but what else and then the next step is having a peer or a clear draw again mentioning some combos queen jack offsuit queen 10 offsuit jack 10 JT offsuit, Deuce 5 suited, 3 5 suited, Deuce 3 suited, 4x, Kx, weak Ax, then at some point obviously Ax maybe up to AxJ what villain might have is not nutted, but it's an okayish hand. And then, villain is not really nut protected. not protected he has well three combinations of pocket fours some ace four offsuit but is that still nuts on most runouts very very questionable so by far the biggest part here is villains part two so as we've learned in part one of the fundamentals it's now the time to find sizings that make sense in general it seems like a small sizing attacking villain snap fold part can make a lot of sense we make him fold his trash perfect hand is over we won a big sizing could make sense we charge his medium strong part right him sitting there with king 10 or king queen or ace 5 and we just bomb it right remember every big bet is a donation into villains nuts but there are not many so we can do that big bet works out perfectly so with small bet big bet what should we do now how should we build do that. Big bet works out perfectly. So we have small bet, big bet, what should we do now? How should we build our wardrobe? Now, I came up with a clear question. And this time, I want to use the solver to give me the perfect answer. So what I did was just running some simulations that I want to show to you. And I didn't want to put all the data on the slide so let me explain that briefly. What you can see are three simulations. I'll go through them one by one. Let's start on the left side. There you see a game tree where I only offered a small bet 25% in that or actually 30% in that case but that does not really matter. What we see here is on that board the solver suggests to bet very very high frequency and doing that strategy, and remember that number relies on all future streets as well and how we play there, the solver tells me my EV is 64.67% of the pot. Okay, perfect. Let's take that as it is. The second simulation, that one in the middle, I made very very different game tree and i offered the check and actually an overbet 120 i wanted to double check hey does that big sense make sense how does it influence things i see okay our cbet frequency gets decreased by a quite obvious investing a lot of money you can't do that all the time almost 40 percent though and we see well something like ace king is just like going for it all the time obviously pocket four all the time obviously ace four high frequency adding all the bluffs that can make something and now just comparing the first two game trees either c-betting small with very high frequency or betting very large with low frequency we can see that the EV for the big option is higher so what did I do next I obviously ran the simulation with both options I like to go step by step so we see both options on the very right side and actually what we see here it does not increase the EV of the one in the middle which tells me that small bet doesn't affect anything. Again, the simulation on the right side is nothing else but the one in the middle. Just adding the option of the small bet. You can see that the light red color is not really used. I'm always looking for single hands. Is there a single hand that wants to use that size more than 50%? I see pocket aces, maybe that one, but that's kind of it. And I see, okay, it's actually not making EV for me, given that I play perfectly the turn in the river and villain does the same. We'll talk about that a little later. So what we have seen now is just that even though through the graph and just the logic and villain has those snap folds against the small bet we figured out that well the solvers tell us that doesn't make any sense to be betting it doesn't't give you EV. And there is a big reason why. Villain does not have any equity against our range. If Villain has 10-9 off on ace-king-4, what should he turn? Like turning a 9 and then play his third pair as a bluff catcher against a super strong range? There is just nothing. And this is the big, big, big difference. So actually what that means is the lower villain's equity is in those spots with his folding range, the less interested I am in betting. So I see that as having two options. I can either bet and make him fold something that is worth nothing or I can check back and force him to play with nothing out of position against a strong range. And I want to get that right here. For me all those hands are kind of draws. When I'm talking about villain is very very low in equity against my given range, well that means that in other spots it might be different and villain can still outdraw me which does not necessarily mean I'm talking about straights and flushes which all people are when they are talking about draws. So what I'll actually show you next is a graph how I think about draws. Everyone thinks about dry and dry, two sides. I don't know, because some words are dry, some are dry. I will keep that, dry i will keep that but i will call it dryness to nuts it's like really that dryness that scares our nuts if we have the top set and they are straight draws and flush draws we have to be scared of not having the best hand on the turn anymore. But unfortunately, we do not have nuts all the time. And there is some kind of dryness to, let's call it, medium strong hands. But there is some dryness to, well, some medium strong hands as well. That scare us when we have a weak top pair on a lower board. When we have a second pair something like that. So folding out those draws denying their equity or charging them while being ahead is very very good for us as well. and this is how i actually think about it. Two kinds of drawingness. You see what I just explained. Drawing to medium strong hands, top pairs, or drawing to nutted hands, flushes, straights, whatever can beat our nuts on the very next street. So let's take a look where is our ace king for well it's actually kind of drawy in the nutted sense every queen jack 10 deuce 3 5 does change the nuts but if villain is not having one of those draws he has pretty much no equity against something like my top peers or second peers talking about villains 10-9 jack-9 and this just got proven by the solver that just means i'm not interested in folding it out it's a big difference whether i fold something out that is worth nothing or that still has 10 equity against me maybe even 20 to have another example, let's just look at the ace-king-4 and go upwards. 9-5 deuce rainbow. There, I have high incentives to fold out anything. I might have such a strong hand like pocket-tents. Pretty nutted on that board, I guess. But villain might have which is six outs plus backdoors potentially about 25 to beat me on the river folding that out is just necessary for me and i'm not talking about well some kind of drawing as to the nuts here think about us having the nuts well we are maybe playing more against 8-7, 6-8, 6-7 which could outdraw it but yeah that's another topic to think about. Maybe we just want villain to keep his king, queen, king-jack, queen-jack in the pot because it's actually good for us when he hits his turn card. So now for every board and I think this is a very very very good practice for you to just Thank you. he hits his turn card so now for every board and i think this is a very very very good practice for you to just take some boards and fill them in in that graph i started for you on the very left bottom side i started actually with a monotone board ace jack eight think about the definition I gave for the kinds of drawingness. If you have the nuts right now, I have a king high flush draw i cannot be outdrawn sure there can come a boat right but that's very very yeah low frequency so it's not on the very very left side but it's very far left and at the drawing to medium strong hands if i have an ace well villain cannot really out draw me in that sense right sure he can make a flush which is something kind of nutted as well but it's not that well when villain has five six of hearts on that board he is freaking dead right so that's it let's have a look at the top right side. 6-5-5. Think about we are having something nutted here. Not talking about the lock, about the boat, but something like ace-5. Super, super, super strong. Obviously any spade sucks. Any 7, 8, 9, 4, 3, 2 sucks for us as well. So it's very drawy in the nutted sense. But at the same time, if we have something like ace-6, medium strong hands, it's super likely that this one gets out drawn. Well any seven, eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, king, ace, not the ace actually, would give villain a better top here. So this is another kind of drawiness and especially that drawness to medium strong hands tells us should we use a smaller sizing more often to attack these things. Think about this attacking part I'm using when I talk about bet sizings. We need to bet bigger to attack something like flush draws, gut shots and open open enders. We are charging those draws because they won't fold. The other part I talk about denying equity because I expect those hands to fold. If I c-bet on 6-5-5, I know that villain is folding his jack-9 offsuit. If I c-bet small or maybe not very small but half pot on 9-5-2s, I know that villain is folding his Thank you. folding his jack-9 offsuit. If I see that small or maybe not very small but half pot on 9-5 deuce I know that villain is folding his king-8 offsuit which is three outs to a very very good top pair. So let me break the whole thought process down even further. When thinking about sizings, sure, I have image of ranges in my mind. I can draw those graphs. I think about range part. But in the end, it all comes down to two questions. Actually, it's a full four questions because the first two need follow-up questions. First thing is, does villain have lots of snap folds? That is true on lots of boards like king king three but it is true on something like ace king four as well. So we know already that on king king three we love to have a very very high c-bet frequency but on ace we didn't like this small-bet-high frequency at all. So what's the difference? Well, the difference is in the second question. Do I want to attack it? On king-king-3, I'm folding out lots of equity. When I have pocket fives and villain folds jack-9, that's a huge success. If on ace-king-4, I have a medium-strong value hand value hand let's say a king and i bet and villain folds is 10-9 off i didn't win anything so this is what i mean with do i want to attack it am i doing something good for myself am i denying equity is that happening then I want to use a small sizing if not not really second question does villain have a lot of medium strong hands again well if that is the case i would love to attack them with a big sizing hurt them right like ace king four bet over a pot villain sits there with any king, with any gutshot, and just hates his life. This is my goal. But I need to double check, and therefore the follow-up question, if yes, can I attack it? I need to double check villain's nuts. The more nuts he has, the less I can bet. Because every bet into nuts is donation to villain. Donating is great, but not to villain on the poker table. Let's actually go one more step. And let me put in exploitative thoughts in this topic here as well. So we are still on asking for the board we were talking about all the time. And you can see already, I offer another two simulations. We have talked about exploits on the flop. The more people are passive, the more we like to size up when we have it. But the more we like to increase our seabed frequency at the same time because we realize equity. So I wanted to double check with the existing sims, going one more step. And what I did is again that max exploit. I wanted to see, well, if I use the small sizing, villain should actually check raise quite something. I have seen villains answer in Pio so I didn't think that this is really happening. So I have the read that villains are not defending aggressively enough and I just didn't allow villain to check raise to see okay how does the solver react. And now we're actually having two very very different game trees on the left side you see well that node lock version it's not node lock it's actually just not allowing villain to check raise then we end up range betting with that small sizing i didn't offer anything else and on the right side you see the perfect simulation for just the big size Thanks for watching! with that small sizing. I didn't offer anything else. And on the right side you see the perfect simulation for just the big size which we have learned that already is as good as offering another sizing there, another small sizing. And now what is the fun part about it? Actually the EVs of those two game trees given that read that villain is not check raising are the same more or less very very close so we have two totally different wardrobes you can build here and they well can be somewhat similar ev so for me it's important that you understand where Where does it come from, how do we react to certain situations and even more what do those EV numbers, where do they come from. And this is again what we talked about a lot when I was talking about pre-flop charts in the pre-flop section I need to play perfectly on the next street villain needs to play perfectly on the next street and the river both of us need to play perfectly and well this will never be true so it's actually something where I can implement more knowledge and prepare for example one game tree that is maybe not the common one and make sure well i know that one better this is one of my favorite examples because actually i think it's very easy to react to the 120 percent sizing you can just fold pretty much all the time when you don't have something it's just the board is better for the button you can just fold the shit out of it. The other one is super tough to react to. I do need to find those check raises and whatever. Sure if solver plays versus solver the big bet is mandatory and more important. But maybe the real answer is a mix in reality. And one big thought of that is what do I want to achieve do I want villain to make a perfect fold on the flop but if villain has air and I see that small he folds which means he plays perfectly or I check back and he's forced to play with super trash out of position in a spot where I have the stronger range. And this is something to think about where actually this is something I'm trying to do on high stakes a lot. That I just assume that everyone has seen simulations like that and knows what is somewhat correct. But I try to put them in a situation where they might not know. And then they are playing in my action game. And this is what it's all about. I'm choosing often game trees by the edge I think I'm having in a given one that I'm choosing. So let me summarize that again. In part two of the fundamentals, we did not only talk about bet sizes that make sense, but we went one step further and thought about, well, maybe let's compare that to the other option. Small bet versus checking turn. What about equity what is what is the real success of us making villain fold it's not about winning the hand it's about winning the hand against a certain amount of equity and then i presented you a totally new thought probably to just think about different kinds of game trees that we can choose because we are in the action game to force villain to play well a part of the game tree that he doesn't know too much about to make use of his mistakes bringing us back to my main three questions I want to understand what would be right. I hope we did that for now in this spot. We can always dig deeper and talk more about sizings but that's not the main thing. And secondly I need to find out what villain is doing wrong. And third that would be another option for a cool exploit. I need to know how to react perfectly to villains mistakes.
