### TOPIC: cash postflop flop as the aggressor liveplay
 Hello, I'm going to put out the next live play for you guys. We are again on Zoom 200 and today's session focus will be on the flop. Talking about building my wardrobe, about the sizings I choose, the exploits I might put in there. And as always we'll just see how it goes, hopefully some interesting spots coming up. You see three tables of SUM200 on the bottom left, I keep the replayer ready to take a deeper look if a spot gets really interesting. And as always there might be different spots that are interesting coming up, but I try to focus as much as possible on the flop decisions today. King-5 suited, sometimes three betting against the knits so far, just 35 hands but not doing anything crazy marking limper raising so now first thing to evaluate is okay who am I playing against right he has a pretty low gap vpi pfr 22 19 but will be kind of a standard dracula so now we have two spots at the same time on the bottom one I will only go with a small sizing because I actually don't have the nut advantage with all the straight runouts he's incentivized to do quite some check raising here so my nuts don't want to bet big so why should i bet big anything uh this is definitely a fine check as well i like to be a little more on the betting side and here this is just such a strong board for me we can go with a big sizing and some checking or just arrange bet small that's both totally fine so as you can see already i have two different wardrobes that i could build in my mind for a specific spot here and decided to go with the easy one um now turning those trips um yeah pretty pretty easy play left side same not i mean same thing like on the five four deuce a little it hits villain better than me a small blind flatter i still just go with a small c-bet um because good stuff is happening for me regarding all his broadways he might be having um so yeah actually different boards but same flop strategy that I could apply on those. And now this is always special right we have a 55 33 a 3 guy a 34 guy flatting the small blind I don't really goosy get out of my pool I'm just recording a video so I won't be staying for too long I'm just trying against a super wide range in the small blind and a 10-7 guy in the big blind i just start uh betting at that pot they shouldn't connect too much with the deuce four if they don't have a king All right. all right so this one is for him so hope hope to see you at the poker code and you can see your check race there um okay so so far lots of small c betting i hope we get some other spots as well. Here this is a three bet pot, so happy to go on that. I will only bet big on that board. I go with half pot. I bet as an exploit full range. I say he never has threes and fours pretty much. And yeah, I'm allowed to bet pretty high frequency, not a hundred percent because I don't have, I just have too many over cards, but it's just super tough for him to play back. and we will see that a lot on actually those boards that where i should check back a lot like that 865 up there against a small blind flatter i will keep as an exploit the c-bet frequency quite high because in nl200 people are not fighting enough for hands they are not check raising enough not realizing how strong they hit a board and that means i over realize equity so they answer more by check calling than by check raising and i see a turn card and this just as we have seen in the fundamentals about the flop we've seen examples where the c-bet frequency just goes up dramatically when villain is not check raising enough and this is why I will play a very very c-bet heavy game on the stakes instead of really adjusting to the board perfectly and how my range hits it. So ace-5-3 it looks like a dry ace high board but actually it's really really bad for me from under the gun. He has deuce-x, he has 4-x, he has 6-7, he has 5-x, 3-x so lots of runouts will be really bad for me. Something like pocket Queens is just a mandatory check back here. Obviously as an exploit just c-betting if I am not facing check raises here on that board I should check raise 15 to 20 percent against my c-bet. Yeah if this is not happening I can still c that and then check down later but um yeah super happy to save money here and just fold that i'm checking back very very strong and yeah no need to to bluff catch something like pocket queens here so again to repeat what we've learned in the fundamentals what i keeping an eye on is not advantage right now not advantage over time the ace five three board was a perfect example for that because well we might have not bunch right now not really right do we have fives threes a hundred percent depends probably on this table yes we don't have deuce four okay but over time well as soon as there is a one card straight around the deuce or four or six seven makes straight etc that's just that's just killing us and um this is why villain is incentivized to do lots of the betting so why should i do it okay let's keep going see i started betting and now actually polarizing on that turn defending Defending big blind versus small blind. Folding out better flush draws, very important for my hand. While having 12 outs, obviously a good thing. And this is a pretty good card. um period board I'm not sure I mean the 6 he can have nine X of spades. He can have nut flush draws, but I think it's still good enough to go all the way. I don't know whether I should use a smaller sizing. So that would be something I need to look up. And I don't expect to see any sets, so I'm not scared of the of the paired board it just makes him probably call a little less but um yeah putting maximum pressure out there so 833 if you have already uh watched the video about three bad pots and c bedding in position you know already this is pretty a brickish board so we are only using a bigger c-bet size. Might be 50, might be 65%, whatever. We can discuss that at another point. I just simplify there a little and have the 50% button. There are multiple options, just not going for the 25%. We want to get the money in on the flop because a 4 is a pretty bad card for us. And now we charged him already before. That is great. And wow. So much action. Not even getting to look at the replayer. So yeah. Set here. And those kings, they play themselves. And the fours force actually i mean not the perfect spot to overbet um but i think as an exploit against all the light calls and i don't see people check raising enough as a bluff here um so i'm just putting money in myself with those pocket fours how about again ace four deuce one of the boards same like the ace five three before rainbow i'm playing a very very low c-bet frequency um and while pocket fours are not not necessarily 100 c-bet obviously it's probably the the hand that you want to c-bet at highest frequency and now with that queen on the river especially uh him just check calling the double flush draw board we have multiple options we can bet that uh amount or we can just jam and yeah I think anything is fine going for this usually I would randomize I don't have it open right now the question is how is he playing the hands a little weaker than mine and he definitely check jams ace queen and he has it probably all offsuit combinations in his range so i'm not losing value against that i hope he's still check jamming a6 that would be important to not miss out on value here plus additionally he might have bluffs and yeah so i mean this is now ridiculous right he has the super freaking nuts i'm just sometimes betting that and i have ace jack i have ace king i have all that this is just not raising that is a big big big big big mistake and now that comes to obviously that mistake saved him some money this time well this is very very important to understand this is a note for me right does not understand the correct river check raises i mean he has the freaking nuts and he's not check raising so i need to make sure to get the money in myself i can super easily just bet the river he will never raise uh that's that's good so probably never bluff raising either and yeah i just need to make sure i put the money in myself then when i have it right pocket force just jamming it so this is one that really hurts um but at this right so i'm i'm happy on the one side because uh he made his clear mistake and uh obviously sad on the other side because I just lost probably 100 whatever dollars in value. Okay let's keep going. It's 10 let's count that as an open race and again one of those spots where how do I continue here what is his range okay it's a special spot now limp call he might have any kind of broadways and I think he's not check raising as aggressively as he should here so I'm just putting that small bet out there I see the turn card anyways and Realize my equity might check down against his ace 9 offsuit with the ace of clubs and win or I might fold out his king queen or whatever it's all it's good stuff for me and Now I check back Hit my river hit the river or not and yeah just this is what I mean with a pretty c-bet heavy game now obviously folding and yeah playing that four bet pot I think on that board I'm mainly using a small sizing I can use half pot as well if i want and now i mean i need to call that price just because i have the odds pretty much to hit a straight almost um and yeah i don't see any bluffs right he needs to turn his whatever six seven suited into a bluff something I'm not seeing pre-flop too much I mean I would fold just ace five right away and you can exploit me by turn by floating pocket nines and then turning them into bluff probably but yeah four bad pots are a special thing with very very tight ranges so this So this is in theory, just a very, very close catch that you sometimes make, sometimes not, but I'm just not seeing the bluffs here to be honest. So happy to over fold there a little. Okay, let's look for the next flop spot where we open raise and we are in position. Four or five off pretty close against that sizing. Seems like weaker players, so i go pretty like pretty light here um facing a pot size c-bet would be great to know his wardrobe now right in limpod is he just a player who always uses the pot size button and it doesn't mean too much or is it like pot size because he has a strong hand and um and usually he's checking or betting half pot or anything so keeping an eye on that is super important um and yeah someone limping potting is just freaking strong and not necessarily the jack 10 i don't have the nuts but i just from now on i expect that he is not a strong player And might be the type of guy who just plays kings and aces like that. So I'm trying to stack off here. I don't see any sixes in his range. So I'm sometimes running into it. But actually I want to go for the value gem here. Just the way he played. Very exploitative thing now. Obviously this is way too light. But I just see him having a better hand. And I see the chance of him being a player who just cannot let go. Okay let's keep going. Ace-jack right that board he can play a small sizing and a big sizing, attack all the draws or just the misses that I'm having. I would guess that most players are doing that so against the small sizing I will defend here by calling. If I had a diamond I would do some check raising. And yeah going into his perspective this is what I would do as well. I would have that small sizing he used or whatever my small sizing is and i would have a bigger sizing as well um especially having the very nutted hands in the small sizing and something like that as well and in the bigger sizing the the little more vulnerable um hands like pocket kings comes to mind first pretty much and then obviously draws and and ear as well that come along and like i like to use the lookalike principle there if i bet kings big i like to have some king x here as well and this is how i build my range again one of those type of boards where we had a couple of already that I cannot see but at very high frequency, but I will just cheat because people are not check raising them often enough and I take a hand like that and use it as a small c-bet to get called by all kinds of ace highs, to fold out some kind of Jack-10 and realize equity, right? I'm just saying he's not check raising his five six five seven seven six nine X often enough and this is where my money comes from now not paying more but seeing two cards and yeah actually winning sometimes at showdown this is a board where I like to size up a little and play the half pot strategy there and the ace king on the right side let's give it a try okay calling was a totally valid option as well folding was another good option as well okay it seems like we're not getting that amount of hands in in that spot that i was expecting but that doesn't matter at all right because we can still talk in theory about it and again what to focus on is well specific tendencies of those players i didn't have like specific reads so far on anyone but i just go with a population tendency that people are um not check raising enough so it's fine for me to c-bet wider than i should especially with hands that hate to get check raised ace king on 943 was a great example um and yeah therefore you see lots of small c-bet only spots right now on the 10-7 deuce i want to make use that he has no nuts right now and charge his draws right away. I used half pot on that board. Three quarters would be totally fine as well, maybe even pot. If you put that in a solver, you definitely see a big bet for the reasons I mentioned. And then at the same time realizing, okay, like again, the bottom left we talked about. Ace, four deuce. We had ace, five, five three rainbow as well so a board where we actually have not not disadvantage right now and we will have even bigger nut disadvantage over time once there's a three a five what could be nuts on the river um okay the flush does not matter too much we both have that but yeah just that thing what do we add what what can our queen jack king queen king jack all our offset combinations what can that get right and thinking about where is my advantage and which kind of pot size do i want to create my advantage is for example having ace king that he does not have. Great, do I want to play for stacks on that type of board? On most runouts probably not, so checking a lot is just mandatory here. And yeah now we could change the perspective again and say okay against someone who's over c betting we could do lots of check raising and attack all that. But today is about the starting point on the flop the flop as a restart of the hand and evaluating that correctly taking into account which type of villain we are facing to then build our strategy right very often my strategy was just small bet or check or even 100 small bet some we have seen now was small bet and big bet but no check right knowing and then looking at the hand and deciding this is one i bet full range small and now a7 with the ace of diamonds is a good candidate to just bet large i don't like the seven of clubs another one would be better because it blocks some of his folding range right if he had a7 of clubs he would be calling the flop and folding the turn but not a big deal having the ace of diamonds gives me good playability for the river and um yeah waiting for one or two more interesting spots definitely check calling my ace 10 here for the for being the aggressor in position to go that through in detail once more that ace 10 um yeah i'm just going to fold here. It's suited very wide open with a weak player on the button but I think that's totally fine. I'm going to check to him see what he does and facing larger bet. Having the read station so it doesn't tell me too much when he's betting but yeah turn seems as if this hand might play itself so let's have a look and yeah big bet on the flop likes like i kind of put it on-10 I wanted to say, but this is just okay. Ace-6 off. So this is obviously he had the better hand pre-flop, but still it's good for us, right? This just tells me okay, my open race was pretty good if I get to play against all those type of hands. Yeah. Gary K. So someone who is not even raising nuts. I don't expect to bluff pretty much ever. So I'm just trying to keep the lead here. And attack his ace queen, ace jack without a heart. And I will block bet the river again. He's obviously calling any heart if he has jacks, tens with a heart. He can have a flush, he can have a set as well but I'll just go small, small, small, fold to any race and yeah. Looks like we are not getting in the spot I'm looking for anymore. Maybe now ace king. Pocket fours I try to check down versus random ace high that is not bluffing. Obviously not trying to move him off that. Ace eight maybe winning by checking down. And now again, right? So we have 10-4 deuce rainbow. Villain does not have offsuit to pierce that's always great for us so it's fine for me to be betting a large here if it was it's very very close to the 9-5 deuce rainbow board that i talked about in um in the fundamental section and here i'm actually using a half pot bet or i'm checking this time i'm checking this time i use half pot and even an over bet it would be better if that was rainbow because actually that flush draw gives him not nuts but somewhat nutted hands right something like three five of diamonds ace five of diamonds this is pretty great uh on flop. Now I have an easy call and then a river decision. I'm not turning ace king into a bluff. I have weaker stuff there. I mean, sometimes he's giving up something. Often he just has a random peer after his half pot, but I'm not trying to move him off that with that hand strength. And yeah, that's totally fine okay let's wrap it up here maybe last any two open first in against super knit awesome taking it down and that last big blind defense so yeah again right make, right? Make sure you understand that right when I'm talking about, hey, flop as a re-serve the hand. Who is the boss? Who has the nuts now? Who will have more nuts on the river on most runouts? Which sizings do make sense? Then on the exploitative part, do we have clear reads on villain, right? do you have a population tendency that people are not check raising that people are always value heavy that they are having insane splits on turns that you can make use of the delayed game tree um yeah right i do that here now this is this is a read that well people checking that board that i'm would see that with a very high frequency it's mainly like having an eight or nines or tens or whatever if he has an ace he's mainly betting the turn probably i'm just jinxing it now and i'm running into an ace but i feel now eight nine gets there nine ten gets there uh but i'm just trying i'm just representing my ace 7 and i go for it twice even though having hearts is not that great um and that's just something what i mean with probably face up right if he has now ace 5 of spades he played his hand perfectly and he calls me off and maybe he's even catching me that's all fine um but just a general thing um do we know anything about it right did he have now pocket nines or ace nine is he really bluffing me with pocket tens now i don't know is he checking queen 10 i don't know right i'm not trying to be after it with my seven something here but um yeah so again that topic super important because yeah once we open race and the big blind defense and this is a big amount of the the whole game right we need to re-evaluate how the ranges play who is who has the advantages which strategy to come up with we build our wardrobe make the decision what fits for our hand take exploitative reasons into account so there's so much stuff to think about make sure to try the same thing yourself right discuss it in slack with your peers with the community check it out get the discussions going and try to improve your strategies there over time
