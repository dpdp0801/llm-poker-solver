### TOPIC: cash postflop monotone boards in position
 Let's start the topic today. We'll talk about flushy boards. I will try to focus on general logic again. We will have paint games today. That comes only out of my mind and you won't find anywhere else. Hopefully the stuff you're looking for and some new logic. I won't present anything that is like that different from the solvers. So peel the flush mono boards in position. Even before I show what's the plan for today, I just ask you guys in very general words what is special about flushy boards what is there to play differently what's your approach just one sentence two sentences just like one two three words anything can help that i can work with the more input i get the more i can customize what i say towards you if you go with examples please stick to the single race pod in position but anything is fine nuts are robust on most mono boards so robust meaning in that sense here if we have nuts now we will have nuts later right often it's only the pure board that can kill us but in wowsers which are really really tough so that's a very good point if we have it now and villain has none of those full house draws we actually have a hundred percent against lots of heads it's very very very backdoor straight and like i don't know backdoor flushes when we have a set or two pair so this is very very important to understand very good monta says no big sizings flop very good also will definitely only small sizings why they are more effective and so on so first two comments exactly what i'm looking for there's nothing wrong if you're a super beginner and we'll work on that as well careful with small sizings on early streets unloading on rivers okay so actually i can tell you already the last key takeaway i just wrote down small small i don't know the last word small small explode or small small go crazy this is kind of same thing that taos just wrote and tries to correct tick tick boom exactly that sounds great this is a really really this will be the last slight tick tick boom in other words okay maybe one thing back to what deep intro motor wrote in the beginning nuts are robust meaning that we won't gain many new nuts on the turn and not on the river so that tells us a little more on the river in a certain range we need to take them from our flop nuts right so a little mixing comes into play here to not always bet when you have it another small idea coming out of that robust thing that the nuts are there. Okay, good start. Here we go. For all the beginners out there that they actually know what I'm talking about, I will give you some general thoughts. Nothing else but what you just wrote down there. Then we'll talk about the applications in-game, right? I want to split it up the general thoughts what should we do in theory or why is that the case and then the application right what does that lead to right so something like the application this is not the general thought now we'll obviously have some examples also some exploitative thoughts as i try and all those more theory-based topics to put them in there and then to leave you with some key takeaways that you have planned for your next go right so very very very quickly the spot we open raise any position and let's skip the small blind okay if the small line calls it's also fine but for the examples we'll use the big line calling most common spot and then the flop shows three cards of one suit so there's a mono board some people call it monotone i've already heard monochrome whatever you want to not fall into any traps so it's a mono board meaning three cards of one suit three hearts three diamonds three spades or three clubs and flush possible best case we have that flush but we are talking about that spot for all the hands we are having right so very very clear spot and that brings us already to the general thoughts you gave me some i tried to comment a little first of all when i think about that spot is that there is very often not a clear nut advantage everyone open raises for example from any position any suited ace more or less and the big blind yes maybe can defend actively by three betting some suited aces but mainly is still calling them so both both players have the nut flushes, both players have the second nut flushes, both players have the third nut flushes and so on and so on and so on. So this already when we talk about application, that both players are nutted, are protected and we need to find a way around them to still make use of hopefully our advantage that we are having as the in position player with a stronger preflop range. So that leads us to the next bullet point, which is just the question we should ask ourselves. It's the big trap. Just look at our hand and see like with a nut flush draw, we have a nut flush, this and that. So in that thing, which is important to me here is to really think about where is my advantage? We already figured out it's not the nut flushes, even if I have it right now. It's not the second nut flushes most of the time. It's maybe the sets. It's maybe the straight draws. It's maybe this and that, more top pierce and so on. And that should lead us a little into the direction of the sizings already. Thinking about which pot size is perfect for those heads which pot size is best for us to achieve to make use of our advantage often as the in position player on this means we try to go directional in in a certain way right often we bet small on the flop we over bet on the turn and then villain has to fold all his straight draws and then if those cards get there we can over bet jam and the direction is all in because we create a game plan situation where we have the clear nut advantage here we have robust nuts which i actually love i'm not using that too often but i like it so i try to use it more nuts are robust villain has those nut flushes second nut flushes and we'll figure out today that this is actually lots of combinations in a big part of the range that we need to find a way to not go directional in too much. If our advantage is in the straight area, in the set area, top pair area, maybe this is one we actually use smaller sizes to get to that point. Which is now bringing us to the third bullet point. I want to write it down like that. Actually it's nothing else but the second bullet point but i want to have that clear cut that i say okay our advantage not about the flushes it is a flushy board the flushes don't tell us who has the advantage necessarily it's that so it's not the spade spade spade but it is maybe the king 10-5 telling us who's better and then we we think about that pot size that we try to achieve and that we can see that actually as a certain border i call it personally the flush zone where we go into the flush area where we really should consider playing with flushes with flush blockers and this is what we are mainly facing from villain when those ranges play right well he will call his flushes and fold his sets mainly and this is where really other things matter at that point so we'll use that to do lots of transfers from rainbow boards to then use that plan that we created already in like most of the spots that we learned about to then take that and use it for mono boards even though everything is different different. So this is the plan a little for today. I want to just, I just did that this morning. I want to give you an example. And actually, I never think about that beforehand, but now talking about it, I think it makes a lot of sense to just ask you, what do you think? Random spot. I have two examples and it's more or less the same. Let's say button open raises, big blind defense, and we get a mono mono board which percentage of the range for each player is flushes just think about it it's like half of the time you have a flush that's obviously not true that would be a 50 that you can write in the chat is it one percent out of the one out of hundred times you have a flush then you write down one percent you can split it up button and big blind you can give me two numbers if you give me two numbers please do big blind first because this is how it looks like in my percentage that the big blind has flushes and the percentage that the button has flushes omg kai rudy already i can tell you is running a lot above ev here making lots of flushes these days very good for him but maybe he can he should consider playing a little more offsuit hands open raising from the button and also from the big line 18 is a little high or if it's a one and an eight then it's a little low don't be shy i know of kai hoodie i can make some fun i won't do that to everyone so french money going with the seven percent ten percent with luke eight percent all right so you see already very close numbers maybe some people are really good maybe just are are looking things up so this is very very good numbers like eight percent of your range making flushes is freaking a lot if you compare it to like over pairs and stuff so the other point i want to make sure that you understand here is that first we make lots of flushes both not depending on the board i have a high board i have a low board and to have that compare that to good hands on rainbow boards, I have a high board, I have a low board, and to have that, compare that to good hands on rainbow boards, just to have a feeling of like how good things actually are. And that in those positions, wide ranges, button versus big blind, it actually doesn't matter what the board is exactly. If we change that and we'll get to exceptions there, to tighter ranges, tighter ranges it matters a lot right so on the right side here this year is big blind versus under the gun big big blind plays still lots of suited hands less of the offsuit shit so actually relatively he has more flushes nine percent is really a lot no matter which board ace king nine five who cares but, it makes a big difference, right? Under the gun is not raising many hands, mainly high peers, suited hands, but they contain an ace and a king and high offsuit hands that don't flop flushes, obviously, right? So while on nine, five deuce, you're very, very good with flushes, on ace, king, deuce, you have have lots of trouble and this is something that we need to keep in mind ace can do this is a beautiful board for you but actually mono board if you come from under the gun you have a huge flush disadvantage it's it's not small it's huge which can lead to lots of things we can learn from that do you still hear me i just see like some some bullshit here we paused your stream and stuff like that Please tell me it's working All good. Okay, so really important this helps, you know We'll get to the application in a second But this tells you to invest less money as under the gun having just less nut advantage It tells you at the same time to fast play more Being the big blind just because you should put the money in the middle. Under the gun needs to shut down at some point right while again the comparison 9-5 deuce rainbow well we always have it here coming from under the gun or ace king deuce we always have it here because we have so many sets and two pairs just the ace king relatively to our kind of tight range just just is a chunk and the big blind obviously suffers hard so i want to show you two things just the absolute numbers and then also the numbers if you compare them big blind versus our open raising position how big of an advantage you can have or not have right so I think of mono boards in a sense of always evening out advantages. So if we take boards where someone has a clear advantage in rainbow, the advantage gets smaller if it's a flush draw board. And if it's a mono board, then it gets, well, very small because all players have everything in the nuts sense okay this is the first example not example not advantage right and now opening it let me stop here right because this is actually already a lot even if it sounds very easy so any questions coming up regarding that to just understand hey even if something like an ace king high board is good for us we do not have another advantage anymore because so many flushes exist. Just like give me a thumbs up is it clear or now is the time to just ask a question before I keep going and paint crazy random race tracks. One thumbs up, at least one. That's good. Susu, here we go. Contrast is telling. Okay, so where's paint? Let's open up paint. And now how I see that and why it is so important for me that I included not only mono boards in that example. Actually, I only used two examples, but I included the rainbow boards as well because i want you this is my style of coaching to not learn by heart how to play several not have like a big spreadsheet and learn several mono boards how to play them i want you to understand those right and this is how can we change a board and what does it do to ranges so i want you to understand rainbow boards and if you understand them already because we talked in lots of coachings about rainbow boards and maybe flush draw boards as something in between but a flush draw board just meaning 35 percent of the time there will be a flush on the river the front flush there's some more backdoor flush draw possibility but just means it brings things closer together and on a motor board that already happened. So I show it to you like that. We do our racetrack, we start starting pot on the left side, starting pot and we already think about which pot size do we plan to get to with our somewhat nutted hand. Usually we think about nutted hands. Here, we stop doing that because this is not where our advantage is. So the starting pot here and here on the right side is all in. So again, for everyone who hasn't been there in all those coachings, I use that. We kind of make a plan, right? That like we say, how do we want to stack people if we have it with flush with mono boards it doesn't matter if it's not a paired board ace high versus king i flush will go in the middle at the end whether we jam five times pot or we bet normal and then he checked jams that's not what we need to plan for it's really we need to plan that part where have the advantage. We figured out the flush is not the point of the advantage, it's everything else. So now I want to start with an example of a rainbow board. I told you already what we do here is often that we plan bet small on the flop. Maybe overbet the turn and then have a huge overbet on certain rivers let's quickly check that like that study very very quickly this is a very wild thing here so 100 bigs let's do some reasonable thing okay we play button versus big blind for the example. Button versus big blind. Flop is, I don't care really. Let's take a queen, seven, rainbow, I said, right? Queen, seven, four board. Check. We can bet small. We can bet medium. Anything is fine here somewhat. Villain calls. Turn is a beautiful 10. Rainbow, check check we do lots of over betting i would say boom 25 of the time we bet 170 12.7 of the time we bet 125 here i put those together and have like a 40 of the time i'm just betting 150 part personally right i take the higher frequency one the 15.9 now call river let's give us a good card we are greedy right so let's put a freaking nine out there or a king let's take a freaking king let's check check nine sounds sounds reasonable check and we bet whatever we need whoa all in two times pot with like sets and top two pair and the rivered straights and our bluffs this is kind of representing that game plan that i just showed you right other things where our advantage is not that big we keep our range a little more together and count on villain to help. There's the plan maybe a little more that we bet small, he should check raise a lot and then he does the job. Maybe we have pocket threes on 553, that would be the plan that actually villain does more more of the job the main plan obviously if he only calls our bet we will adjust to that but there's always a main plan in the back of our head so now we mainly think about our advantage and let's go back to that example here with a good run out we count on good run outs where we can do something like that. Now the problem is if it's Q7 4 mono how does all of that change? How does all of that change? Which part of the strategy changes? Any idea? This here is the flop bet pretty much, our plan. Flop, turn, river. Turn, take. idea this here is the flop bet pretty much our plan flop turn river turn tick tick dong right or something like that very important right it does like our river straight obviously can't go all in and this is where our advantage is sure our nut flushes can can jam the river that's okay but that's not where advantage is. And this shouldn't be our focus. So how I understand that is actually that we plan something like that, the same thing. But our goal is now, this is now what I said in the beginning, general thoughts. Where is our goal, right? Or where does the flush zone start? Let's say the flush zone starts somewhere here. At that point, it's all about flushes. And what we can do there, just for our brain, we take the whole plan and do this here. So that shows you a little. It's kind of the same plan. And it makes it makes just in my head at least it makes so much sense to follow the same plan just forget about the flushes. We try to stack up not try to stack off but we try to get in like 30 40 big blinds maybe. It makes sense that our small bet on a mono board can be even smaller right on queen seven four three spades what is what do you try to fold out like a king ten no spade a min bet should be enough right well on queen seven four rainbow to fold out a king ten even without backdoor flush draw right it's drawing to the nuts it's a stronger. It's a backdoor straight draw to the nuts with a solid over card. So even the flop bet to deny equity can be smaller already. The turn bet needs to be smaller because if we go big it's very easy for Will. So let's compare that quickly. So queen 7-4 let's have a quick look at that here. Mix of 27% small, 22% half pot, and some bigger. Just keep those numbers a little in mind. And now I switch that queen 7-4 flush. It shifts. It's less betting. Some of the small betting goes to checking. Some of that betting goes to maximum half pot pot and most of that goes to that So just everything goes smaller, which I hopefully represented well with shrinking that whole plan So next thing we start smaller and now actually this is I would say we see the tendency. I would say it's a GTO wizard mistake here. I mean, we could run now, obviously, if we have the time, but I want to make it as simple as possible. We could put in our own sizings and so on, but I'm just seeing that and it's clear for me that it makes sense to use a smaller size than 33%. But just what I see here, why not 20%? It much sense what are we attacking with that 33 so many snap folds everything it's not really even even close right strategy ev like a king 10 still a clear fold that's shown in a weird way some something got different here but that's all so it's fault. So we could go even smaller to have more indifferent with things. Like why not 25%, 20% and so on. Okay. So and it's we don't necessarily need to check that much more. I think we can keep more or less the frequency but just that smaller. This is just not allowed here by the sim because 33 is the smallest option. Okay, let's do that. Let's get that same beautiful 10 which gives us lots of important now, not draws, but lots of draws to best after flushes. And the question is always where do we aim with our best after flushes? With our jack-9 if we hit, our ace-jack if we hit. What do we try, which pot size do we try to aim at if we have pocket 10s? Stuff like that. So here, the turn shrinks as well. It's not the overbetting. Doesn't make sense. Makes it very easy for Willen to counter. None all-ins, none 250%. Remember, we're at of this sizing here. Some, some, some of that I would say does not really exist. It's maybe the black pocket kings that want to maximum bet and then check back. I don't know, maybe some of that. Why doesn't it show the suits? I changed something at some point here. I was looking for something and didn't find, but okay. It's more of that and actually what we do not see much queen 7 4 10 the 50 did not exist so smaller double barrels to keep the three streets alive with something like 8 9 jack 9 king jack ace queen stuff like that that want to benefit from that positional advantage right still think about our nut flushes don't need to do anything now we can still get the money in the middle by either four times pot jamming the river or getting the race in both is fine right the smaller turn bets do exist so let's actually have a look at that 50 percent and it's still tough villain. He has a four, he has a seven. He had that one mediocre heart, right? Like an ace-eight with eight of hearts, like good luck. Stuff like that, that he floats on the flop. So we keep the initiative. We keep building fold equity by playing multiple streets. And let's do the same river. Not the ace click king of diamonds and we see here 5.5% all in 500% pot yes we can do that it's easy to build a range to do that with both value and bluffs and then we have like that area here right a low flush maybe betting that The straight I would say is probably only betting this maybe what is it enough for 150? Where's the ace Jack? It's actually just the 75% right? So this kind of shows us the flush zone my pocket sevens It's also just the 75% bet and something like an 8-6 of hearts tries to go 150% like this is the maximum it can get because actually once getting check raised it's a bluff catcher all right so the right amount of greediness and yeah well if we bet this villains still have nuts it does exist this re-raise range right this all-in range we're actually like that smaller re-raise exactly against that sizing i think in in the real world we use more of one size but yeah i think it can be seen in the complex sims they contain loads of sizes for research purposes but have to be enabled in the same like solutions okay yeah probably i prefer more to just trial and error to just offer 20 sizing or even smaller and just see does it get taken then it just overrules the output here well i for me the logic is enough here that i say the smaller size makes a lot of sense but for me very very important to just showcase you can use the strategy that you know hopefully or you or you learned already a little. You just try to aim at another point. And that point is this here. If we want to invest more than that, we are going into flush zone territory. So this is flush zone here. We need to have a flush. If not, it's a bluff. So here it's about flushes and blockers. So we can have a look here at the if we go into that at the all in size okay very clear not like that sorry if I click on that what are we doing we have the ace of hearts or we have the nut flush that's it right. What about that sound here? What are we playing like that? That's flushes. What do we add? Again, like random blockers. Very clearly. So ace of hearts jack probably makes the cut also. This implies we need to use many of our flushes in those smaller bet ranges, right? Especially on the earlier streets, I'd assume. Absolutely. And it's important to understand that you don't need to get the maximum now on the flop because, well, you get it later. You can put out those over bets. You can put out five times pot jams no big deal right it's you're not missing out value actually in the last slide also there will be the word greedy a lot i want you to be greedy but greedy doesn't mean here that you just bet pot because you have a flush and you want maximum out of a he's top pair plus a flush draw he will call Sure. And then on the river, obviously in theory you need to be protected with all your ranges. You want to bet a two pair, you want to bet the sets and so on, that you protect that with flushes. But it's important to understand that you cannot be protected... you cannot protect against nut flushes for example. If villain uses blocker, you just cannot have it. So you will have like your king high or jack high flushes in that spot that once you check gems river they are more or less a bluff catcher at some point. Let's have a look. We bet 13.5. Villain goes all the way. The all-in only represents king and ace high flushes. Oh sorry, check this here and now he goes all-in. And you can have a look at your nine six of hearts. It's just the two blockers make some money. But it's not really, I mean you're not beating anything. So two flushes here, ten nines, a little blocker thing. No clue why it shows something like the two up three down i don't understand what is what's going on there why it doesn't show hearts usually there is something where you can change that i don't know what i killed there when when testing things to this morning actually king jack king jack of hearts is a good solid fold right this is just so so so wild right so yeah there there are there are other spots where like second nut flushes are folds and like some others that are some like have the slightly better blockers are the clear calls uh those are the blocker scores okay does anyone know where i get rid of those and summary filters that box also this shows like very, very good one. I understand. Okay. Never quite I don't know. So just important to understand, right, that we can do this small, small, big, but again, we're not making our money necessarily by playing the nut flush better. Sure, we can make exploitative folds if people are not bluffing. We can bet fold second nut flushes on the river against some people. We can do that. But the money is actually coming from playing the board correctly, that we gain the maximum out of our advantage, out of our rivered kings. Out of our rivered king queens. Out of our ace jacks, jack nines. Instead of betting the turn too big. And then realizing, oh, we rivered a straight. And now we need to check back. Or we value bet them into the flush zone. Which means it's not a value bet anymore. If we end there, let's say we bet half pot on the flop. Somehow we do that. Villain villain calls turn is the 10 also now we bet too big again so let's say oh we think cool we have the king jack with the king of hearts beautiful or the ace jack with the ace of hearts we bet too big call and now we river our hand like same same run out and then we sit there with like an ace jack no heart whatever and now i talk about different different examples at the same time and we've we figure out it's like yeah weird spot like maybe not that but the king queen we shouldn't have that here even so it doesn't show it that we don't have any value anymore stuff like that and We kind of messed up the spot before Yeah showing ranks and suits in the hand combo, I don't know where I changed that like this morning they're letting them changed here no Just showing what I mean here like right there it was this morning i could change things and i tested a couple of things and now it's just gone but i'm i'm not a specialist if you find out let me know if not we are fine with that we know that those are the hearts okay so very very important stuff to under to understand that tick tick boom tick tick boom. I will make one more example. Let's make another one. Under the gun this time, big blind calls. We take this spot, 9-5 deuce, no clear advantage regarding the nuts, obviously over peer advantage and so on for in position. We see again only small bets. 57% of that and I tell you just because of that it clearly shows that a smaller bet should exist as well. If we look at that rainbow it should be a wild mix of bet sizes this big one this half pot this year everything makes sense on mono only only small right obviously something like a jack 10 of clubs that villain might have and we want to fold out it's just so shit that that any min bet is good enough right so we do that again villain calls and now we get the 10 of clubs. 10 of clubs. That is a nice card. Slightly good for us. Some offsuit straight draws. Again, the main sizing is half pot. We want to value bet our 10. We don't want to run into only better hands. We can't invest too much here. So pot it is right me personally i'm betting on average way too big because i'm just used to it and probably not often enough because i'm not going that thinly so half pot allows us to go a little more thinly for value call and now the river let it be a maybe a three still 15 big blinds in the middle. 13% all in. Just the easy easy 620% jam. Now pretty clear that we mainly have Ace high and King high flushes. This is why it's a quite a lot of percent that do that and some hands that want to do like a smaller size. not much in between so we have the sets that that are that want to bet but actually you see that we bet small on the flop half pot on the turn and pocket nines are indifferent to betting the river this is how many flushes people have it's we have the freaking flop top set and i'm 100 sure that any one of you would always bet that top set here just like not realizing how not strong it is. Okay. sure that any one of you would always bet that top set here just like not realizing how not strong it is. Okay, what we need of showing ranks. Exactly if you click summary, we can better see the hand strength betting each size summary summary summary. overview table equity chart no oh down here this one I've never looked at that like I just don't understand and the hand is still not shown this is really really weird I've never seen it like that top right icon on the bed size button I just reopen it quickly oh okay that worked out so on the gun where's big blind nine five deuce bet we had a 10 on the turn and then that okay i think this is what you guys were looking for that summary here with the hands so and now this here went went back this was gone before and if i go there we actually see the hands also here we we go. Okay. This is wild. Maybe because of the disconnect before. Okay. Anyways, we wanted to look at this year and yeah, so a couple of things. Just important to understand that bet sizing scheme. It's very, very tough and very, very tough to find clear guidelines for that. So this is one if I play versus GTO Wizard where I still struggle a lot finding the right bet sizes. So there's no problem going all in. And this is now coming already a little exploitative. I like to be more greedy the weaker the opponents are. Because I know I give them a challenge, right? Just jamming here. I give them the challenge of like Folding flushes, which I do not really see that much I assume obviously I don't see them fold but I've seen lots of people snap calling there We're not folding a set or whatsoever. So this is my personal take that i prefer being a little too greedy even with like sets and stuff but we'll get to that and here what else did i want to say i don't know i'll remember so this was now lots lots lots of pain showing something and so on we are not examples were planned later but this year is what I wanted to show and this works for all kinds of pots now Maybe one more example Remember what our plan is on a beautiful ace-king-deuce-rainbow board. So I need someone to tell me ace-king-deuce-rainbow What's what's our plan here regarding our racetrack? Ace-king-deuce-rainbow I said I said. Overbet, right? One interesting thing I found that... Okay, I'll get to that in a second. Go big, directional in, right? And this is the one where we don't need the small bet necessarily on the flop, but we can go big, right? Here we had small, big, huge. Here it's more like big, big, all of it, right? Depending on on the river and now this is kind of the same thing with a flush this is still true we have ace queen on ace king deuce mono we want to get some money in but it's close how strong our hand is definitely not all the way i mean ace queen is tough for all the way but maybe it aims at that point which allows us but it still makes sense to have a bigger sizing in the way. I mean ace queen is tough for all the way but maybe it aims at that point. Which allows us but it still makes sense to have a bigger sizing in the beginning or check because two streets are also fine. So let's investigate that for a second. So the main point here is really that we can transfer our learnings from rainbow pots. Check. We see that ace queen, king they would over bet let's make it mono boom not oh it's button what's happened here okay really not much betting i thought it looks like under the gun but we are checking or we're still not we're not using that we like we're not interesting say as interested in same same reasoning like like always we're not interested in folding out six eight of hearts it's not what we want on the board like that so we either bet something or we bet nothing right so something in the sense of like not over bet but something like that right or we check wait for our brick six of diamonds and then again we won't use that tiny bet this is just same learning because it doesn't make sense and now we take our ace queen and we already see it's a mix a lots of rivers it's only one street this is how how weak things are and even ace king all right now reading kairudi's question one interesting thing i found was that in position bets low mono board more often than high mono boards but we're speaking kind of reversed what we are used to because of blocker effects no i'm betting on high boards i have more of the big bets the imposition bets well usually we have a higher advantage the higher the board is but we are less incentivized to use those tiny bets in a tournament yes ranges are so wide that we can range bet and so on but here we have seen the ace king deuce i'm so bad today ace king deuce that here we are not really incentivized to do that it's just equity denial right here we don't care about the 7-8 offsuit we fold out on another random board on mono we care even less on that now i said 8-7 so i'll make it 10-5 with lots of hands we are very interested in folding out something and we can achieve that for a very cheap price again saying this price should be very certainly smaller than 33 percent for the majority of our range okay so yeah equity denial is very very important one more thing i want to make lots of general things because examples are very very specific with that depending on exact range on how people play before but to understand the general part of it is also that if you have those strong hands that you have quite often the robust nuts you can think about if you make villain fold now that's question for you guys if we have a very solid hand here let's say we have a flush and villain has a fold versus our small bet how much equity does he fold hardly any right so if villain has a queen nine of clubs he has zero percent against us right value of fold equity when we have it is exactly zero if we have a set of tents a rainbow board, something like Q9 offsuit still has the running straight. Well let's have a quick look how much that is and this is a small percentage but if he gets there in a way because we slow play he turns an open ender and gets there on the river. It's something where we probably stack off. So we have pocket tens on a board like that. 3%. But 3% that we lose the full stack is a lot compared to the flushes. And obviously pocket tens is the best case here. So just shows, let's make a jack nine to have it a little more. 4.8% with a jack nine. Okay, this sounds a little more like folding. So fold equity always has an upside. If we have pocket tens and villain folds jack nine, it's slightly good for us sometimes. If we have a flush and villain folds jack nine, we win zero. This is why lots of those flushes also get slow played. Because we need that, that we are protected on turns and rivers, but we can have a look here. Ace-Queen of Spades, indifferent. Ace-Jack, indifferent. Ace-9, indifferent. Ace-8, indifferent. Ace-7. There's not even a clear preference regarding regarding which ones we want to bet right so it's a huge mix and then like random medium flushes like what about a jack nine of spades it's a freaking 50 50 just because of that and the hands that we get called by yes it's nice we have jack nine of spades he calls a bet we are probably ahead but he only calls hands or partly that have some kind of equity, right's nice. We have jack-nine of spades. He calls a bet. We are probably ahead. But he only calls hands or partly that have some kind of equity. Often they have a spade. If we have a low flush, it's often a higher spade. So it's like it's not such a huge success getting called by something that still has 30% against us. It's not that great. Sure, we can complain if he gets there and then we lost a big pot but yeah kind of kind of the understanding of how much equity do we have against the calling range and how much equity do we have against the folding range so how much do we benefit from that okay let's let's keep going with the presentation i lost a little track here we go so we are still in the general thoughts and now we start in the example not advantage paint games and I use the examples I want to use later but that's fine. Application in-game we talked about that a lot. So take the rainbow strategy and decrease sizings is a very very very valid idea here. Now we learned a little more that checking makes also more sense because in every scenario that is not monotone boards we know that if we check back we will gain through the turn card we will gain new nuts right we will gain the turn set pretty much all the time turn strong two pairs that are very very good stuff like that but here turning a set when villains range is nine percent flushes is not that helpful i still like it but it's not that helpful right and then obviously we can turn a flush if there's spade number four that's a very different spot then that does not really help so to be protected on turns we just need to keep some flushes but again important already exploitative part we only need that protection if will knows how to exploit us if we don't have it right so i don't want you to go out there, play some lower stakes and just check your flushes. People won't overbet too much in your face. People won't go thinly for value. This is what I want you to do against other people. Okay so this is a big if you face good aggressive opponents then you need to split your strong hands, second bullet point, into all parts of the game tree. Think of those equities we just talked about. If you make him bluff with 0% equity into your strong hands, this is how you make a lot of money. If people are not using big sizes against your perceived weaker check, then that's bullshit. Then you take the money you can get from them by calling and then again focus on where your advantage is talk about that in your head right it's where's your advantage 9-5 deuce with the flush draw it's it's the over pairs under the gun versus big blind it's not the flushes it's probably not the straight connectivity that well is actually beneficial for the big blind so that gives you always an idea what you're trying to trying to what you're what you are trying to aim at so where strong heuristics so when new nuts can be turned we don't need to slow play as many flop nuts to have enough nuts on the exactly the Exactly. The more draw your board is, the less you're checking back nuts. Very, very easy game plan. Let's take... Oops, misclicked. Let's take the drawiest board we can find. Button versus big blind, we take like a jack, nine, six with a flush draw. Doesn't get drawier than that. And now you can tell me how many of your nuts you're slow playing. Pocket jacks, pocket nines, pocket sixes, jack nine, pocket queens, pocket kings. No. Because you can rely on any... Just tell me your turn nuts. It's important to have nuts on the turn. Turn could be an ace. You have some ace jacks. You have some aces you check back. It's okay You have some ace nine a lot. That's pretty strong turn can be a king. Well, this is why you should check back some queen ten Turn could be a jack Now you have quite some jack acts that you check back like a jack ten like a queen jack turn ten What about some king queen sure you got it? you are preparedx that you check back like a jack-10 like a queen-jack turn 10 what about some king-queen sure you got it you are prepared for that you also check some seven-eights i would say turn nine is very obvious and easy turn eight we got the queen-ten again turn seven we have the set and two pair and ten-eight probably also that's we are prepared for any turn card we We know we have nuts. Here the problem, zero nuts. If we bet every flush, any turn card, yeah, okay. If the board peers and we check back, some of our 2 pair. Well, then we have nuts. But that's not happening that often, right? It's 6, no, 9 outs that the board peers. Or if we have a jack 9, then actually we have 4 outs, right? If we have it, it's less likely that it's less likely that it happens obviously right so yeah that makes a lot of sense and that means if we want to be protected on the turn we need to take care of that now all right i would like to filter for spades now somehow i can't do that um but again we see ace 10 just look at the nut flushes go step by step ace-7, they all go like 30% into a check. King-i flushes, same again, king-5, we got an easy 40% check, something like that, nice. King-7, king-8, right, and we can keep going like that. Alright then, it's interesting to look at the game tree there, how should it look like? Against the check, villain should probably invest some money. Big blind. Invest some money and then we sit there and go from there. Filters tab. I have no clue where that is. Too much for me. I'm too bad with that. I'm sorry. Filters on the right side of the info screen. Yeah. Something like that. It feels like it was here at some point, but I think they changed it. But yeah, another at another time. So I think that should be clear and it's very, very important. Next to summary. I don't even know how I'm so bad. I feel so stupid. Oh, come on guys. Where's freaking summary here. Summary filters. Here we go spade two spades nice i feel so freaking old but yeah perfect cool so here we see it this is in our freaking checking range very very important so now we get to this is beautiful actually we get to the most important slide actually not this one we talked about oh this is examples from the last let's forget about that i didn't change the examples i just changed the headline we had examples so if thoughts people overvalue flushes i want you to be greedy if you have an ace high flush and he has a queen high flush and you don't stack him it's on you very very very clearly people fast play the wrong spots fast play not meaning they are just putting their money in on the river no it means they bet maybe too big on average or they just bet every flush all the time. Just see how many flushes should be checked back. Do you think your opponents do that? And now the most important thing, if you think your opponents are not checking back their flushes often enough, what is the right exploit. Yes, mantas partly. When they don't check back enough flushes, their checking range is capped. We gain another advantage. We can bet big. Exactly. It's not random betting, but we can go thinner for value just because we play a different range, just a weaker range, and we can bet bigger for value. We can go thinner and we can go bigger. So let's say, check, check. The big blind should, you see which sizes the big blind is using. Let's kill that filter. Betting small, betting medium, betting this, because the big blind cannot use big sizes because the button is very protected in the theory world if we know he's not protected hell i gotta show i show i looked at the the last two sessions that i played for for videos this one here where i applied that just like i looked up whether i find interesting spots that i just played one example i open race race 9-7 suited he calls, mono board 6-8-5, I range check, he snap checks back. What's a good sizing on that 10? What do you think? Against a snap check back of a guy on NL100 I've never seen in my life. I don't know. I did that. So this is two times pot. Like the $6 is wrong. It's I think 570 in the middle because of the rake. But you can obviously do that as a bluff. I don't know whether they call too much or not, but I can do it with those hands thinly for value. I can do it with flushes. I can do it with like a queen jack offsuit. Anything is fine. Like depending on the level of certainty I have on my read This would be a great thing to just note lock Something to just see if they don't check back flushes like really a strong never Then we are going insanely crazy Obviously if it's like they do it less than they should it's somewhere in between But the direction is clear and we need to understand that since i think this is the biggest exploit i want to give you guys today from that session here not this where where's the law here hammer on their checking ranges both bluffs both value and the value can be way thinner than gto wizard shows us at the pocket ns we have seen before that only wanted to go for two streets, bullshit. Obviously we go for a third street because people check raise their flushes maybe even a little too often. That doesn't make that much sense either. Yes, you can have a check raising range, but people play that wrongly. People are less protected than they should be. This is the big, big, big, big, big learning. Any questions regarding that? I'll go to the key takeaways. We'll have them all clear. I want you to transfer from rainbow boards to mono boards. That shows way, way, way more understanding than learning things by heart. I hope you understood the reason to split flushes. It helps you in game. The reason is that people cannot exploit you. If you don't split, you have no nuts on the turn. I hope you understood that. It's fine to do that against weaker opponents, right? Where you want to build the pot. pot if they don't invest money there's no reason to check back a strong hand and then slow slow tick tick boom i like it more the slow slow crazy big slow slow explode is something uh that's it's very very nice just but this is the first bullet point here is the most important just take your plan decrease the sizings and follow the plan you had anyways until you reach the flush zone and then once you reach the flush zone you can go maximum right away so um there are lots of spots where where you just have those five times pot jams and it's easy to find that ace of spades bluff somehow i always use spades for for flushes and how i do it personally is just thinking about which bet sizes do i need to have so if i have like for example an offsuit straight that got there that i want to value bet i need that range to be protected somewhat in theory so i put some of my flushes into that let's say I bet pot on the river instead of five times pot. If I have not much that I want to value bet, it's only flushes. Well, then I go all the way, especially from under the gun MP where I only have the good flushes. Okay, would you say that if they don't know how to exploit us when we don't have enough flushes in check-check, should we then bet more of them or keep checking some? I don't know how they continue investing money against after check check once but on average i would just bet them more often but take take over control of the pot size it's perfect question but i want you to keep the control of the pot size because if he checks to you again and we can guess they are not check raising often on the turn but if he bets the turn and you race you still get the same amount of streets in the middle but i like to to keep the control because we can always go bet bet all in that's especially the nut flushes if you want to slow play something take the lower flushes you can react to their sizings and often they tell you whether your low flush is nutted or not oh okay i get it i can't rely on exactly people are too passive especially they are not not investing enough with bluffs okay do it let's close with one two more example actually i don't want to make up a random example. I just show you the three hands I played I don't know whether I played them well or not. Let's see here Standard spot We'll get a mono board. We'll flop a nut flush. I'm in the big blind. I'm checking range Open raiser checks this guy checks again Turn we could go crazy crazy I'm checking any eight I'm having here so I go for look-alike that helps me as well if I have any other hand with the eight of hearts I'm checking here so I check again he bets a size it's not tiny it's like bigish for a flush board so i think i can play it like an eight of hearts and just check call that was my in-game thought i don't know what that is good but i just want to let you let you look into my brain here a little it's it's a bet size that on flush boards we know we should always start small and this is already kind of a statement which tells me he goes for two streets so i I played a little more like that, how I play lots of Ace of Hearts maybe, and lots of Eight of Hearts. And I waited until the river, just with that turn size info that I expect him to bet very often again. And now this is where, once I race, it's all about flushes. enter the flush zone there's nothing else and then it's about the blockers do I have it or do I have the blocker so there's obviously only one sizing all right so this is now what is that 1035 so 80 85 into 35 pretty much is how you can count it so like a 270 270% pot jam, something like that. And unfortunately, I don't get the call. But yeah, I know what my range can look like here. Okay, so one hand, unfortunately, no big, big hands. So but it's, it's pretty clear how the thought process can go here. Let's have a look here three by pot. I misplayed it because I didn't see that we are 200 big blinds deep. I should bet bigger for 200 big blinds but here I start small, right? My hand is shit. He can have pocket sixes without anything. He can obviously have King-Jack suited. I blocked the Queen of Diamonds, Ace of Spades. That sucks but still we can bet a lot here because some people are raising their flushes too often and then they have trouble on on on later on later streets turns another heart is that a good card for flop or did not have a flush. Then he has medium pocket pairs now or 10 right so i'm the one with ace king offsuit ace queen queen offsuit king queen offsuit so i think it's a very good card for me and that allows me to keep lasting right it's the wrong size in here i should go even better bigger because of the stack death but right that worked out pretty nicely right so that's another thing understanding what are bluffs on the fourth card we didn't talk about that i don't it's lots of stuff lots of general stuff all right now very good question again deep into mortar what made you say he's looking for two streets with that sizing let's just forget about the third guy in there right he wasn't under't under the gun or hijack razor. I called from the big blind. Flop was king for a deuce, something like that. For a deuce of hearts, I had ace, eight. It goes check. You see, this should be a strategy. Check, check. Turn was an offsuit, eight. Here, my theory, like this is, I played like an eight. I think multi-way, I have more of the offsuit eights. Actually like this is i played like an eight i think multiway i have more of the offsuit aids actually i don't have many here right so the look-alike with an eight does not really make much sense but it was in my head still so i checked my ace eight of hearts and this is what told me that he bets two street because flushes we keep it small we keep it small the first bet into the middle should always mainly be a small bet right here we see small or maximum half pot this year is four percent where i say well pretty clear if he uses this sizing it's usually looking down at the hand maybe it was check check with ace king with king queen something like that pot control and then wanting the value it's usually people being greedy it's not that he takes his queen jack offsuit with nothing and now bluffs big so this if he bets 1.5 i see myself way more check raising on the on the on the uh turn here i was very certain that i get another bet in if it's not a hard river right if he has king queen here ace king he bets big here i call we can have a look what what is i mean here it's not very different because i make assumptions everything is obviously everything is fine because we need to mix and then the river let it be a freaking brick check he bets his king queen again he shouldn't even hear right but i'm pretty sure he King, Queen here, if that is the case. So this was kind of my read on the spot of the sizing that he uses wrong. Wrong is a strong word, but like a sizing that shouldn't happen that often. Okay. Maybe this one, that's not that interesting. Clicked on my hotkey. I think I could bet smaller on that. Plan is to fold out something like Queen nine, like queen jack, like king jack with no heart, right? Especially against people not check raising enough, especially not bluffs and not correct bluffs. I think people check raise flushes, but not enough. Like this is a beautiful check raising hand. And yeah, so I bet. And then I catch a half pot river bet. That's nothing fancy, right? So just two or three examples in the end. What do we have here? Raise. Here I check back. High cardboard. Not much. I have one straight hand. Not really interested in folding out low shit. And yeah, now, okay. I call down two half pot bets of some random guy. Or actually, here, he bets only turn. And then he he even checks the river And I think I don't have a value bet so like really slow slow slow slow slow and Yeah, I think Since it's this sorted by pot size. It doesn't doesn't get more interesting than that. Just some some big blind defensive folds but okay Alright, let's wrap it up here. I know it was kind of a yeah it was not that planned throughout the session but i kept talking a lot with the general thoughts because it's really tough with examples and there are not many things where we can go clearly i hope it was still a little eye-opening we had some spots here and there and you have somewhat of a plan for the next mono boards you are facing important is really that slow slow boom understanding against who and why you should sometimes protect your turn ranges and river ranges checking ranges and against who you should attack like just ridiculously it's um deep into mordor um on two-tone boards are mostly in the middle of rainbow and mono boards kind of, right? It's like you can really see it like that. We think about the river ahead always, right? So a two-tone board will be a flush board about 35% of the time. And I don't like that number. It will be a flush board on the turn about 20% of the time. Obviously it's 25% the suit, but if villain has the flush draw, so it's like counting a little into the blockers on turn about 20% of the time so we can treat a two-tone board like 80% rainbow 20% flush board so it's way closer to the rainbow and here I'm talking about only the turn because this is the point that every flush draw reaches every flush draw continues on the. On the turn we start folding out flush draws depending on the sizing. So if the board is like K10, 5, deuce and we overbet the turn, villain has to fold like 7, 8 of hearts, even some nut flush draws, some queen high flush draws, so we can get rid of those flushes that actually the river heart does not really interest us that much. But then it would be more like 65-35. So we stay way closer, but the flush will happen and the flush will even out things. And we know how often the flush will get there. All right, let's wrap it up here. Feel free to put in hands as always in in the strategy channels and yeah we will have our next coaching very very soon since due date of my wife is next month for our second kid it's it's mid of november so i thought that november coaching we have it in the beginning before things get wild here and yeah so see you all november 4th i told felix already i'll try to make a follow-up for that so i will actually open a thread and you can get me some ideas or you post some hands and we'll talk about that a little more because it's just in two weeks and yeah then we have a nice topic because i feel like there's more to talk about even with more examples maybe i can i get to play a little and can come up with some examples myself or I get help from you guys I'll come up with something I'll open a thread and maybe there you have some ideas as well yeah not many people today but it was still fun and thanks for everybody who tuned in and then see you in two weeks yeah have a good one bye
