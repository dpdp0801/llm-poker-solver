### TOPIC: cash postflop multiway pots as preflop raiser
 So this is actually, I didn't want to rename it now, but this is multi-way pots as aggressor. I'm still thinking about some add-ons that I can give you as a video that go a little more into detail. Yeah. And, and, and we'll, we'll cover that a little more. So I can tell you already, it will be the month or the weeks of the multi-way pots in the hand histories, because this is like just real world out there will help us most to think about stuff. So I will definitely, if they are interesting hands, i'm happy to make a loom or a short video to give like longer answers and explanations about my thoughts there regarding multi-way pots lots of exploitative thoughts the more players are in there the more likely it is that there is a weak player in there which changes everything so i would be interested in multi-way deep and there's a guy cold call three bets well everyone is interested in those spots that that no one has a clue of. For now, to keep it simple, just put them on pocket eights through to pocket jacks and ace queen suited and play against hands and on a range. But yeah, I mean, it's like tough spots. Perfect session pre-monaco. I heard there would be a lot of callers pre-fill for sure. All right. So this is the structure for today for today as always I'll just quickly explain the spot I'm talking about to be sure we understand it in the same way then it is about understanding understanding the situation is absolutely key for me awareness what is going on what is different multi-way what is the like if we compare it to heads up what's different and then we take even though we just spotter as the aggressor, we still need to split it up even further because there are so many different situations in multi-way situations. And they play absolutely very, very differently. So it's like just multi-way pots, it's like every pot. It can be a single race pot, it can be a three bet pot, it can be those positions, these positions. It's pretty much just like throwing the whole game tree in one bucket and trying to make a session out of it. So I'll have a couple of examples. I feel like we have plenty of time today because there's not much like GTO wizard or like clear examples where I show solver stuff. I'm not using solvers for multi-way. I know there is something existing now, but I never did. So it would be not correct to just like show you something i've i'm not using myself i'm more using pure logic and yeah then i'll have like three prepared examples from hands i played this month and they will lead to the exploits that i i tried to really write down exploits that i think are very natural saying that they work on much all stakes, that they just make sense. And those hands will be examples for that. Some bad examples, some good examples, but they should work out. And if we have time in the end, I'll just go through a couple of the hands. I played quite some hands. I mean, not compared to some grinders, but I got like some 10,000 hands in this month. So I got something to look up and we can go through some to just check out the logic how I treat them in game. GTO Wizard has it on the roadmap. That's great to hear. All right, makes it always simple to keep things together. And then obviously I'll let you go with the key takeaways and crush some multi-way pots. All right, so very, very easy. The spot I think every one of you knows here anyways for maybe some beginners on the platform and so on. I just want to quickly explain it. Multi-way, the spot, right? Don't get distracted by so many words. It's actually just the first bullet point. Just means we are on the flop and two or more other players are involved, right? It's like we're either seeing a flop, it's three-handed plus. That's it,. Right. So everything else is just an explanation here that this really means there are lots of situations possible. Obviously, it's very, very different whether we are three way or five way or eight way in some little parts life. Who knows? Or like multi way part. I think the king of multi way parts would be the bomb part bomb pot in the end i mean would be one two three lessons on itself again for something like that but yeah something like that exists so all that is multi-way pots and we are more talking about incentives and how we should change our game compared to the heads up pots we mainly talk about so since this is way too many situations as i said already we talk about being the aggressor today and every single time i'm unsure whether we use two g's in aggressor now it looks wrong again so i think we have two g's in aggressor can someone some of the real better english speakers can confirm that it's two g's and two s for me in aggressor that would be great and what i try to do in that coaching because it's absolutely impossible to cover that topic is that i try to deliver ideas to you that help in game even though the topic is just way too big i just like give you some ideas that you leave the coaching with at least like one idea it's like oh this is something i can do let it be like some easy logic or let it be some some some exploitative thoughts and yeah that would be uh great if i if i can make that happen two g's and two s as well yeah yeah one s looks really stupid all right here we go thank you i'll try the next one to to to spell it a little more aggressively all right don't get distracted by crazy line graphs or whatever you call that here. I stole that from GTO Wizard and shout out to them. Actually, I was browsing a little around and they have an awesome, awesome blog article regarding multi-way pods. So I will link that in the end. I can post it in the chat as well, or just you use Google, like multi-way pods GTO Wizard, you will find it's a great article that I just give a big thumbs up that you can check out if you want to dive a little deeper, right? A little more with numbers, a little more with deeper explanations would be too much for the coaching, but I give you a big thumbs up for that one. So they talk there and I copy paste that word that we have a shared burden of defense a shared burden of defense. So when we are the aggressor, we mainly talk about betting, starting with a little advantage that can obviously switch with a flop being dealt. But still, whenever we think about a bet, we think about how much fold equity we need, how much is it worth to be bluffing, and so right and now we need to understand that oh thanks swiss power swiss power why i always want to say swiss poker it's swiss power so thank you and yeah so really i see it as like like people teaming up right so again let's use a football analogy it's like really you can be pretty pretty great let's say you're freaking i don't want to say messy so let's say you're freaking up here and then you still have if it's just against against our our joshua kimmich boy that's like you you're probably doing all right but if there's like and let him be as crappy as someone like like eric dyer or something like that if they team up and they go for the two versus one it's just very very tough to yeah you need to make something happen to to play that situation situation great so it's just you can see every person in the pot once you think about betting that they are teaming up then it's not like one versus one versus one versus one no it's one versus two one versus three one versus for And this is your problem that this like is the next bullet point is that just like this creates a very, very terrible risk reward on pure bluffs. So multi way, we can already think about, hey, instead of winning, let's say 50% of the hands, on average, like we should do heads up as the aggressor probably more like 55 to 60%, let's say, depending on situation and position, obviously, but just making up random numbers here. Well, if we had three players involved, we should only win like 33% of that, right? If it's four players involved, maybe more about 25%, just not even thinking about ranges and range advantage that's just very easy pure logic so we shouldn't expect our weakest hands to get any money back that's pretty important right if 50 or 55 to 60 percent we should win the hand well even our weak hands should quite often win the hand right if it's really like that we a situation where we are supposed to win 30% of the hand. Well, even our weak hands should quite often win the hand, right? If it's really like that, we, a situation where we are supposed to win 30% of the time, well, then probably our top 30% are the hands we want to play it. And maybe some others as well. Right. But definitely not like the bottom 30%. So some things you keep in mind, a very simple rule is that something like range betting just stops existing. In most situations, it just does not make sense to invest money with the weakest hand you possibly have. That's just a check, not being interested in the pot, and then going for the fold. So that being shown here with a very easy tight is right. Don't try to push things. If there are multiple people around, one of them will have something. It's just as easy as it is. Now we can talk about other stuff like blocker effects that if you have something, it means it's like two times less likely that it's like for one person, it's less likely that he has something using those cards second for the second person same thing right so you can amplify those blocker effects the same way it works for the let's say unblocking effects if you have freaking pocket deuces on a jack 10 9 board it's very likely that lots of jacks 10s 9s kings and queens are still out there. So really that multiway is just like amplifying everything. Yes, I often hear more honest straightforward play in the context of multiway pots. Is there truth to that? Absolutely. It just means that everyone should more play like only their best hands, which involves in the end like less lying. if you say like bluffing is kind of lying taking your weakest stuff and lots of lots of heads up situation well it's the weakest stuff that you that you put in like a triple barrel range stuff like that and multi-way it's more like maybe the perfect walker hand that makes like some good bluffs but besides that it's just chasing equity and more so it is about not equity all right so having like a backdoor not flush draw backdoor not straight draw something like that because last bullet point here what is increased just think about that always someone always has something it is an increase of implied and reverse in place just like if you have a set someone makes a straight, well, there will be money going in the middle. This is why you with a set have actually reversed implied and the guy with a straight draw has implied, right? And they are bigger than in a heads-up pot because, well, more often someone will have something. What range defending big blind multiway? Google, Google, Google a range. Like, I don's a very very different thing it depends a lot on the second on the first caller right if like under the gun opens mp calls and you're in the big blind well you need to stay freaking tight actually or you need to select hands that can beat those two ranges all right those let's say the is mainly sitting on something like pocket 10s, pocket 9s and suited broadways. Maybe something like your ace 10 offsuit is not good at all or your king 10 offsuit, and it can just be a fold. But something like your 5-3 suited gets more interesting. So really think about which ranges are you playing against and what do you need to beat those. All right. But this is something where actually we can learn a lot from like just browsing a little through GTO Wizard, even if cash ranges are mainly like three bet only in some spots, we can still hop to the MTT crowd and see how it changes there. Okay. So this is very, very important for understanding the situation. Whenever we think about betting, villains team up. It's really, they are freaking teaming up. We have a terrible risk reward on pure bluffs, so it is all about equity. That leads to the fact that tight is right and we need to understand that not equity is the key, right? Because of the increased implies, someone will pay you some money. Right, let's keep going and still understanding the situation. And now this was like lots of things that sounded in the first place negative, right? It's like tight is right. Sounds like for people who like to play sounds negative. What else was it? I forgot already. Terrible opponents are teaming up it's like it's all shit right but now we have other things that are interesting for us if we want to put in some action and this is something that we need to understand that every player is in like a unique situation and even if they are teaming up from our perspective they are still fighting against each other in a way. So whenever the other players are facing a bet every other player that is left to act still puts pressure on each other on them. So let's say we are in a heads-up pot, I c-bet on king-10-4, you sit there with pocket fives, you call a small c-bet, see 10-4 you sit there with pocket fives you call a small c-bet see a turn play in position same spot with let's say a big blind involved still it's like oh fuck this guy behind me will call if he has a king he has the draws he can even have some kind of check raising range you're not closing the action and there's someone with well a good amount of stronger hands behind so this is the pressure that you face as well or maybe the king 10-4 is not a good example we could say it's like a 7-6-4 with a flush draw well there will definitely be some big blind check raises right so it's like you're not only playing against the bet from us talking about us being the pre-flop aggressor but also about the pressure that is on from the people behind Thank you. playing against the bet from us, talking about us being the preflop aggressor, but also about the pressure that is on from the people behind. Okay, this leads to the fact that any bet has more fold equity against the individual opponents once they are not last to act, if they are players behind. Just saying, okay, if like on the heads- pot on king 10-4, he would call more than in a multi-way situation if he's in this exact same spot. Now it's just very logical because he can rely on the other guy defending as well. He does not need to do all the defense himself. And just like for the individual hands, there's something happening behind that sucks What we can take that for is we can bet smaller to gain the same fold equity. So if like a 33% CPAT out of position is like your standard or 30% or something like that in some spots, multi-way, you can go way smaller. It's like 15% or 10% in some spots. If you've ever watched some bomb pots going down, like in lots of situations, like a 10% bet is like the starting bet to just like fold out the trash. All right. And this is the reason here. Bullet point number three, low equities of opponents add up. Often, heads up, we say like against certain hands we don't need to deny equity. Well let's say we have, I don't know what, like we have ace-10 on ace-king-deuce. Obviously villain has with all his pocket pairs, he has two outs to beat us, like with his fives, with his sixes, with his sevens, with his eights, that's four percent to hit the turn card. Which is well okay, like like 96% of the time it doesn't bother us but let's say if we play four way and we have like three people that potentially have a pocket well then that's actually quite some equity right so it's like 12% combined that's really worth holding out so tiny bets to just make those hands fold out or pay that price that they are not worth really is both good options for us. So really, multi-way, the bet sizes get smaller because, well, it makes sense to deny even small amounts of like kind of not equity. That makes a lot of sense because it's not equity for multiple people. And we have more fold equity against not versus the team, but versus the individual people. Okay. Let me check the chat for a second. One ratio. We just talked about it. Not too much incentive to invest with low equity hands. Exactly here. Big, big exclamation mark. Okay. And then one more thing that is important as well is less reason to slow play if the board changes if the board changes it's more likely that well someone will have the new nuts right so whenever you have the nuts and you are kind of vulnerable this is how i call that concept i want you to fast play it's nuts over nuts if you have pocket nines versus pocket eights on nine eight six with a flush draw get the money in now well it's like already good in a heads up pot but even better multi-way well it's like okay obviously there could be a 10-7 around there i'm now thinking about positions where a 10-7 doesn't really exist or a 5-7 suited but like when you have the nuts right now and potentially have a so-called setup for you, make sure to get enough. Don't wait for the seven of spades or the ten of something and so on to not make that money anymore. Even if it's like a king 10-4 rainbow, a turn nine, a turn jack, a turn queen, a turn ace definitely slows down the action. And then at some point, if it stays multi-way, it's just not a cooler anymore. If a straight is out there that some people can have offsuit in their range to stack off a set, then it's just not a cooler. No, if you get the money in at that point where a villain just very likely has a straight, it's not a cooler. the money and charge people for the equity don't let multiple people see equity for a cheap price not equity and yeah it's a different thing if they can catch up to like second best hands right if the board is ace i don't know six twos rainbow and you sit there on pocket aces give them free cards as much as you want until they hit their set right so and then and then you stack a set and this is still a cooler so the nuts over nuts concept and the nuts under nuts is the one you want to slow play right the bottom set multiway you don't want to get it in not really it's like that's the one to slow play wait maybe for a paired board maybe see that seven of spades draw a card and be super lucky that you actually lose the minimum versus the top set right so really the the coolers are only slow play the coconuts absolutely with the redraw to the coconuts that's the one so yeah that's a very easy small concept that just makes a lot of sense understanding that ranges get way stronger multi-way because everyone and we figured that out only needs to invest depending on the number of players they only need to invest money with the top percentage of their range and still no one can win money by just bluffing crazy because often enough people just have something i love that coconut smiley bear all. All right, splitting it up now. Three options. Here you finally got your sandwich. This is on purpose that there's no text. I didn't know what to write. It's very clear what I mean. So we split it up as the aggressor into three options. The first option is just we are out of position versus every other player. This is us opening under the gun, hijack calls, cutoff calls, button calls. That's it, right? Very easy. And the second one is we are in position. Well, there's only one option. We open raise any position and then the small blind calls and the big blind calls. Or in a three blind game, maybe that happens more often that we are in position versus two players. And then there's obviously the sandwich position where, well, let's say under the gun, we open, button calls, big blind calls. I think that's the most typical one. We open raise cutoff, button calls, big blind calls. Most of the time the big blind is involved. So that's three situations. And yeah, let's say even I have some people who love to have a football terminology for that as well. So that's three situations. And yeah, let's say even some people who love to have a football terminology for that as well. So that's the right wing. That's the midfield. And that's the left wing. So it's like left wing in position would be Cristiano Ronaldo. Right wing would be Messi. And the sandwich would be who's good on the 10 now. I don't know. My brain wants to say Ronaldinho, so I can't stop it. So maybe Zidane. I am so old, it's insane. All right, so I think it's clear which positions I mean with that you can you can hurt Donna forever. Yeah. So yeah, we can we can definitely understand that. And this is important for the awareness just if you asked in-game, what is the position? And now this is what we want to do next. Once we've understood the position, we want to go to the next step and understand the incentives we're having. Real 10 doesn't, I mean, maybe Mesut Özil in Madrid times was still a real 10. But real 10 is like the guy who gets the ball and does everything. This is how it works in kreisliga the one guy out of the 11 who knows how to play football so it's like yeah nowadays no more people can can do something with the ball okay let's talk about the individual spots that's out of position it's very easy actually because it's i usually i'd say we play three-handed i split up incentives incentives and I just try to figure out how would I play against each individual range. And then I add that up. So I'm playing, let's say, we open race under the gun, cutoff calls, button calls. So how would I play under the gun versus cutoff in a heads-up spot? How would I play under the gun versus button in a heads-up spot? And very often this is the same right because their range is obviously multi-way maybe gets a little looser a little more speculative hands they are in position but still like the key key elements the key parts of their range should be quite the same so if we get like a 6-5-4 board that is a range check against the cutoff flatting range and is also range check versus the button flatting range then there's only one answer Thank you. So if we get like a 6-5-4 board that is a range check against the cutoff flatting range and is also range check versus the button flatting range, then there's only one answer. It's like same incentives. They won't change. So it's like we will freaking range check and play a reaction game. So I can already tell you out of position, it will be a high frequency checking game. Those guys are teaming up together. They have an insane amount of sets on words like that maybe but still obviously we can have like small c-bats a lot of them on like something like ace king deuce both of them probably won't have much ace king no kings no aces deuces is the only set they are having we have everything we we deny that equity from like five sixes sevens eights n, charge them for their king queen that might be freaking drawing dead to us. So stuff like that. Right. So it's just very easy understanding incentives versus individual players and then go from there. All right. Next one. Second one. Very easy. Playing in position. Again, what is the case? We have two more or less similar spots right here. We know it's the small blind flat and the big blind flat the more interesting range here should be the small blind because it's tighter and it's a little more reacting to the boards like the big blind has lots of shit on every board but the small blind hits some boards well hits some boards a little less well but still still against both ranges, I think we play in position, being uncapped, usually having the advantage, we play a high frequency c-betting game. So if that is the case, if our plan is to do that on a board like king 10-4 versus the big blind, and also versus the small blind, well, then we will still play not a range bet, but a high frequency c-betting game all right exactly we can leverage old knowledge so i try to transfer our knowledge from old spots from spots we know into this this spot right and now in position out of position is actually quite easy obviously we need to slow down a little we face double the nuts we face double strong ranges because we play versus that freaking team of two players, but we can start with small c-bats and then we know often we only have one player left then. Let's say small blind just snap folds, big blind, well defense may be a little tighter than in a heads-up spot because our c-bat means more strength in a three-way spot, but after that it's quite the same. Do you give up on multi-way on the turn even if in position had been floating no matter the board? I don't understand the question. Probably this is too general to give you an answer. Do you give up on multi-way on the turn even if in position had been floating no matter the board? I really have no clue what your question is. I'm sorry. You need to find a new way to to ask that question i'm really sorry i actually like stabbing in position even more than see that in position but today we're only talking about the aggressor yes stabbing in position having the absolute position is is an absolute game changer then and it's something very very very very effective especially with small sizes where people are check raising people are playing playing on us, and then we can run over them on later streets. It's more like that first step is more preparation for me for later streets. And you can see that the king of multi-way pots, the bomb pot, if you ever played something like that on ACR or so or live, then you see how high frequencies are with tiny steps in position. They float even if the board favors range. Well, that means they have something and then I build more of a range. So usually the term then is the polarization. I'm not giving up everything, but I'm choosing my bluffs a little better. I'm choosing good bluffs, look for more equity, and obviously my value hands need to be quite strong as well to beat someone who, well, showed us he has something. Okay, so in position, out of position, being aware of that, understanding that we have almost similar incentives versus two different, or two, I mean, different ranges, that this can lead to us playing in a way that we already know. All right. Then we have the sandwich. For now, I mean you can read the text, I can read it out. Usually we have mixed incentives versus our opponents. So out of position our first instinct is lots of checking, in position our first instinct is lots of betting. Usually, like just talking generally about boards important is that we should focus on the opponent's range with a bigger nut advantage so often that is the button is the cutoff which will lead to a little more checking but something i personally like doing is here to still put out very small bets as we we've learned they put pressure on each other themselves. So villain cannot go too crazy, right? He cannot float like crazy the button because he needs to raise if he has really something nutted. Let's say 7, 6, 4, he needs to raise his pocket sevens here. And if he floats like crazy, he still runs the risk that the big blind can check raise quite a lot. So his floats won't be that profitable, no matter what I do actually. So for cheap amounts, I call that clearing the situation. It's either button calls, big blind folds, and then I play out of position and I know what I'm up to. Or it's button folds, big blind calls, and I have a beautiful in-position spot against the somewhat capped range where it can react to turn cards this is something where i make use of them staying somewhat honest probably investing a little too much money and with my range that's a little like a workaround that works the weaker the opposition is because like multi-way bluffing multi-way like even thin value raises are not really a thing that is seen on lower stakes or even higher stakes so yeah you want to keep your your ranges a little together there against what i'm doing there which means raising some weaker stuff as well and yeah well actually it's lots of raising i don't want to say like call too wide that's that's not the key so yeah seven six four raising some of the a7 raising some of the six five and so on keep your range uncapped raise me and then i'm freaking i'm freaking fucked up with my pocket tens jacks queens and so on which is the strongest part i'm having in my range besides some of the sets i obviously flop so this is just as an idea that we have a problem here that against one range, against the big blind, we would still like to do quite some c-betting. Against the button we would, or against the person that has position on us, we would like to check a lot. But yeah, we need to find the trade-off between that and there I'm actually like situation to situation reacting to the opponents how how aggressive how weak and so on they are yeah he actually says it's you're often the c-bet has more respect when hero is second last in a four-way the last guy is under a lot of pressure exactly right the last guy who has probably even the strongest range they are i'll say we open race cut off button flats small blind flaps big blind flats it checks to us in the cutoff and button now has that extra pressure he faces maybe our small c-bet and he faces an uncapped small blind range and an uncapped big blind range which they obviously most of the time have are full of shit but still like they face that like he faces that pressure and then it's tough to really act accordingly and it's just very easy to just throw away when you do not really have that much interest in that pot which then again is perfect for me kind of buying absolute position folding out a person like that so just really understanding that game theoretically there is not a big difference between betting 10 and checking it's just a pure amount of betting 10 when when we are not I'll put it closing the action. And this is something that we can use very very effectively in multi-way pots. Because we make use, even with the tiniest amount of bet, we make use of the pressure people put on each other. All right, feel free to keep the chat going. I like to see that there. And yeah, I know it's lots of talking without real examples. This is what we get to next, I think. Examples, perfect. Okay, I remember perfectly. And yeah, now I prepared just three easy examples, to be honest, where I think it's pretty clear. I think like I can tell you already, I think I think I played all those hands well and I think it's quite important to have all the moves you see there in your arsenal so now what I just show you the hands and actually what I want to do is that you think about each hand and maybe think about is that standard or was that somewhat exploitative and And if was anything exploitative why do you think it's good or what can we write down to make like an easy rule out of that that we can learn from okay let me see here so they are all from like two weeks ago i didn't play the last 10 days actually so i was talking about playing this month but it was only like the last the first 10 days and we start with this hand so i hope it's big enough we got pocket sevens on the button i do open race and i'll open the chat again if there's something coming up i open race small blind flats big blind flats big blind actually is i remember who it is. It's a very good rack. It's like he forgot to rebuy or he didn't want to or whatever. The small one I don't remember. So it's very likely that it's 773 big blind recreational. All right. So 863, not absolutely my board. My incentives against the big blind, I think if we were a head start, it would be like a 50-50 betting thing. My hand, kind of a 50-50 betting thing as well. Against the small blind, he can have sixes, he can have pocket threes. He obviously can have like jack-10 and like queen-jack type of hands as well. So tiny bet can make sense, but I think I'm not doing that here in position so yeah some betting is good mainly checking is good in in my in my view is the flop i ended up checking all right let's continue here after reading that my leak is not knowing what to do on the river in a multiway where i'm pre-flop razor i see that range on flop that's the mistake you cannot see that range you just cannot multiway get rid of your bottom 30 percent of hands they are not supposed to win anything here and then you are i see a range that turn when i gain equity on the turn then get lost what to do on the river when it breaks yes you play against super strong ranges and you get there with way too weak range very very easy explanation. Just filter out your bottom 30%. Even like on the King 10-4 rainbow, the Ace-7 without the backdoor flush draw is just too weak to invest a single penny, to be honest. People have something too often. And on the river, you end up against a very strong range with way too many bluffs because your value hands are capped. Against a stronger range, you need bigger value than heads up. You need stronger hands. And that means that maybe something like pocket aces on a king high board, multi-way, depending on the exact scenario, are only a two-street hand instead of a three-street. And this is the value you're lacking. Maybe you only represent two pairs and sets on the river but you sit there with all the busted queen jack and jack nine suited straight draws like somehow i always have a king 10 export in mind so this is the big problem just filter out your on the on the flop and you will have way less trouble on the on the river all right cool here i ended up checking back i think the turn and the big blind bets on the bigish side in still a multi-way scenario. So what are our options? Is obviously raising, running into the 10-9 and the 4-5, which I think is an okay option. It's an okay option. Like pocket seven is strong. He can have all kinds of draws that we need to charge. But he can have better nuts. So it's not a must race. It feels like a very honest size. I said it's a very good opponent. So it's like actually it's a very honest size against. The weaker the opponent, the more I like raising, to be honest. That's a very good point here by Damien. It feels like a very I think it's a hot key here playing a good player who knows me as well so it's like yeah I think it's okay so I gave him credit and end up calling raising is absolutely fine and the river is three is small one uncapped here I think so he can have nine ten can have uncapped in the sense that pocket threes and sixes are still good yeah can we say small one is a weak player because he did not three i'm putting the giving him the weak player mark because i don't remember the situation but 73 big blinds is usually a weaker player and then flatting is is a sign for usually a weaker player as well. Obviously, small blind flatting is very good if you're a very good player as well. But yeah. All right. Sneaky, sneaky full house. Here we go. River. We face the 150%. Right? I mean, just this is not the point here. Really, it's that hand itself. It's not that interesting. But even if he bets two thirds, I justthirds I just want to make very very very very clear that there's only one option which is the all-in button right so it's like not if even whatever he does like finding small raises here is absolute nonsense right having the super nuts here against someone who shows absolute strength but it would be even more important if we were still three-way. Just this is something here that yeah, I want you to make question all that, but I think it's too stupid because it's very, very, very, very, very clear that here when we have it and potentially have a cooler for us that we need to go for the absolute maximum. I think sixes should even re-raise when we raise here, but yeah, he's mainly repping a straight maybe some three exit clubs but yeah we definitely definitely definitely need to go all in and if we had like thousand dollars more it would still be an all-in because especially here it's not about balance it's not about anything it's like him very likely in a multi-way scenario having the he represents and us having better. Nice dice principle perfect here. What are our hands? He would just call in that spot. Any three if I find one, if I check back a three of clubs maybe, like a king three of clubs just calling, I'm only raising something better than straight or bluff. I think ace three multiway I'm c-betting close to 100%. The king three I can see myself checking back sometimes and I can check back some four or five I'm just calling four five yeah just calling four or five even though probably raising four or five on the turn yeah who knows all right so kind of easy hand going through but all the way going through the flop about the going through through the incentives and so on. I want to show you how I'm thinking there for a second. Let's go to hand number two. He has to special here for you guys. We open raise the cutoff 2.2x, my standard size here. We get the small blind call, we get the big blind call. And get a beautiful board for us with K h deuce rainbow all right what do you think just give me a percentage just i want to ask the the chat for a percentage of our range no forget about the jack 10 off how often are you c betting like your range not like how often are you see betting in that spot here with your cutoff range yeah asking a question poker code hannesCodeHunters just says, hi team, thanks for that. All right, Philip going 70, nevermore 40, you see a 55, 75, a 70, and 80, right? So yeah. Yeah, it's interesting, right? Because we don't have, I still bet range with any backdoor hope, right? So Yachu gives up five, five, six of spades is like that, that idiot is that straight enough for you maybe you check back like queen seven of spades right so it's like it's important that i don't see the hundreds here but the hundreds are just wrong like a queen seven of spades is just not a bet here you should you should not invest money with that you're not supposed to win that often in this spot just yeah cut off sit some king jack offsuit and this is not our goal to triple crazy move them off that big blind sits on all kinds of king x the sets are out there and so on also it's a mix you do not need to see that every time on the flop you do not need to bet every time on the turn right and obviously you your winnings come from the mix of fold equity and equity. On the river, when you don't hit, the equity part of your EV is gone. So then you solely rely on fold equity. And just, well, for relying on fold equity, you need people to overfold. And then that means in a multi-way spot, you need people to overfold a hand that is in absolute hand strength, a very strong hand getting there. Right here, it's very unlikely that they end up on the river with lots of pair plus flush draw that they snap fold having that rainbow board here. So I would give up a lot. Just pushing fold equity plus equity is fine. That's a mix of like two, I have it like two, two like, how you call that like a Zoilen, right? That build up and overall are like heavily plus CB probably. I mean, checking is also heavily plus CB having equity, but yeah, on the river, one of that disappears. You have the knowledge that you are full of shit and then you just need to give up yeah that's it give up river yeah all right cool all right so here important for me i don't have a number i don't have a solver for that i never looked at it i make it dependent on the small blind mainly right so here the small one is the clear stronger range against the big blind i would range bet talking about incentives against the big one i would do this against the small one i would probably bet like 60 to 70 percent and now I need to find a mix of that right so I probably should size down if I'm playing my a game and I'm not nine tabling I'm instead of I think 27 percent is my small button I want to see that slightly smaller to make use of that extra pressure I'm getting because the small one is the stronger range but he cannot float lightly with someone behind. So I can actually instead of betting 27% I can maybe bet 22% and have exactly the same effect. Then the small blind folds a hand that he would float heads up and the big blind obviously is most of the time he's full of shit. Just not hitting this no hit board and yeah I can run over him later if I want to. So here I actually decided to check back, which is absolutely fine. I wait to see a turn card and then I know whether I pick up some equity or not. All right. Turn is a three. This guy checks. This guy checks again. New situation, multi-way after checking down on the turn. I think this is a spot where not many people go for like the delayed check raise when they have something, so I would say they are rather capped. They are still, both of them can have like random ace tens and jack nines and so on. So I decided to bluff here, which I think is fine, you can do that. And we get this year. I bet bet small this guy calls and this guy raises to 71 we get the first laughing out loud here from luke and my question is what does the big blind have this is interesting this is interesting really that we see the two pair with you see the set we see the four five ace five ace four we see the i think he's strong i mean i had that in-game feeling as well that comes a lot from timing as well but still here i think he's full of all the time like at best like an ace-4 ace-5 reasons is sizing his sizing is just like freaking full of it's like the 50% button plus scroll down or what is that? Like if he has pocket threes, why isn't he putting money in the pot? This is like, what's that? Like I can't even do the math here. Like less than half pot raise. It's a half pot raise plus scroll down. It's like if I have pocket 3s, here's the 150% button going direction all in here, nothing else. If I find a site, I don't know what it is. But this is a point here where I think, like I had the timing and I remember it that he was like, he was like tanking, tanking, tanking, then deciding that there was a plan that was made after seeing my bet and the small blinds call. Obviously we are, we i can have some kings and that's about it or like obviously i can have a random king but yeah like i was like 95 convinced this guy is full of shit and i told him to fuck off where if we play a heads up pot this is obviously a blunder and like it's impossible to have such a strong read right it's like but multi-way people being honest like i just 100 discounted every value hand the way he sized and the way he timed i don't think i think my sizing is not good i think i should raise smaller but this is something that i want to point out here that in multi-way situations having a read it's absolutely fine to get absolutely out of line in spots that happen over and over again you want to stay somewhat in line because it's easy to figure out like if people see like okay you're he's always crazy going crazy in that spot and that spot it's like well this spot will come up the next session or in two sessions again right this is why we only usually go for the max max max exploit against recreationals but multi-way when do you think is that like if i want if you want to prepare now right like when is the next time you will delay bet a three-way spot from the cutoff against the small blind and big blind with a small sizing, and you have the small blind calling and the big blind tank raises with a weird small sizing? Like, it won't happen this year. Like, very likely, with the amount I'm playing, at least. But it won't happen this year, so something like balance is absolute dogshit. Like, we don't give a fuck. My hand doesn't matter at all, right? If I have a three here, here i mean i'm probably not not betting off in the turn but then like it's like i'm like fist pump race and river all in i don't know like it's just yeah i would love to look it up now and see that he is like it looks like the ace four or like a do random deuce or something that wants to call but knows it's behind like something like that this is what it feels yeah monkey on rocks here we go so then this is here in my explanation for like it won't that spot won't come up again and this is why i can do whatever i want this is bluff good if he did not tank the sizing does not make sense there's not a single hand you want to raise like that so if you if he raises to 195 i'm out of here any second. I believe him, it's fine. He can play deuces like that, threes like that, add some ace four, four or five. But here, I look at that player and I'm sure he doesn't do that with value hands, so there's only bullshit left. I don't remember the players, so I cannot tell you about any fishiness, but probably there was something fishy going on if I decide to go for a monkey spew. But still, it's not the point to discuss the tent. It's the point to show you that it's absolutely fine for a reason to go out of line in spots like that, right? Because they won't come up again. There's no read in it and so on. And I would have never bluffed the river. I said, my point is you're full of shit. And I take the money now. If he calls, my assumption was wrong. And then I'm not burning any more money. Also very important. All right. Now let's get to the very typical. And I think, yeah, I think the three examples are enough since we're already like 354 here. But that works out quite well I like it the most obvious I mean the sevens kind of played itself I just want to show the thought process on flop and turn mainly and this one here now the second one was the the monkey on drugs and now we got something else that I think is very very very important we open raise five six suited I go with the min raise from the hijack. Button calls, small blind calls. All right. Here we go. Mix incentives. Sandwich position against the button. We can do actually some big betting. We can also do some small betting. We can do some checking. Everything is fine against the button. Against the small blind, I think we big betting attacking like this pocket peers if we were heads up small betting it's a mix like small betting does not hurt yeah our hand can do anything we need to find that mix any sizing makes somewhat sense any frequency makes somewhat sense again we are not betting five six of spades here never ever Never, ever. Just very, very important. And yeah, I think like our hand, we can do anything. I don't even know. I think I decided to check this one. Keep it small on a pair board with a non-nut flush draw. I like check, call, flop. Yeah, I like even more the check around and I don't need to call a bet. Hello. All right. Your turn. Villain bets, whatever that is. 35% pot. Tense depends on the player, either check race against an aggressive button or bet big myself, the more passive the players are that's what i do with pocket tents so luke calls anyone else wants to give it a go what do you do it damien calls i'll bet something we face a bet maybe you missed that h and k we race small guys come on in my, there's only one thing we can do. Not jam. Definitely not jam. But I mean, this is the definition of this guy's trying to buy a cart. He's like going for thin value or he's trying to buy a cart with his freaking king jack off suit. Like there's no freaking chance he has a speed speed like no way a small flush like a medium flush bets like that haven't seen it in a lifetime i think he's betting a hand that you should mainly check or put in a bigger bluff range but he didn't want to bet on our queen card it's like i say this guy has king 10 offsuit king jack offsuit or he has a queen and this is something that's very very important if he has king 10 with a diamond right i'm freaking raising if he folds i'm fine if he calls i'm fine if he has a Thank you. queen and this is something that's very very important if he has king 10 with a diamond right i'm freaking raising if he folds i'm fine if he calls i'm fine if he has a queen i'm freaking raising like am i beat never ever ever like just because of that sizing like this is what who said in the beginning right people stay honest when they are multi-way and you all play like you played his game everyone who said call here played this his game he sees the next card the fourth diamond rules rolls off and you're like five six of diamonds fuck it's like am i calling is he bluffing probably we sometimes call we figure out he's never bluffing and then we hate ourselves again you have been made yes very small to 115 yeah like give him some you know his hand you literally know his freaking hand and give him whatever hurts his hand most this is why the jam is bad right it's like you can jam you take the pot down 99.5 percent if the button wasn't trapping pocket knives but if we if we raise crd calls actually we have quite quite good information so yeah did did he actually say 115 it's like someone is good here all right so very important fast playing when we have it it's still a dynamic board he calls so maybe he has queen jack offsuit with a jack of diamonds like does he like that's like literally does anyone think we are ever beat here i mean i kind of spoil her that i'm pretty convinced we are not but really like just i'm asking about like this inner feeling that exists i'm usually when i'm playing i'm super paranoid not in that spot but if someone block bets on carrot boards and so on i'll say oh it's trap with the block we raiseway? No, like no freaking way. Re-raise with just the ace of diamonds. The ace of diamonds is never betting like that. Whether I re-raise, I'm re-raising quite some shit here, but then I go probably a little larger on the river. I didn't show you the river yet, but it's like yeah, probably I tried to make something to make the queen fall to pull king 10 out jack 10 and so on i don't need the ace of diamonds here necessarily because i know he doesn't have it very likely all right we get the river brick now after calling maybe he makes a bad call with the king jack with the king of diamonds okay we don't get any value from that and besides that he can have a queen story end so overbetting is bad jamming is bad any reasonable amount seems fine i hope i didn't end up jamming here 250. like even manual 80 percent like okay is that 80 percent yeah probably not really 80 a little more okay meant to say I was having the ace of diamonds and not made a flush to re-raise on the turn. I'm probably calling the ace of diamonds. I'm beating his king jack, I'm beating his king 10, I'm beating his jack 10. I want to win the nuts over nuts. Let us make a diamond, let him have his second nut flush and also there's a player behind who can chase like a random diamond ace of diamonds I'm pretty clearly calling and For raising bluff raising. That's what I what I try to say is I Don't need the ace of diamonds since I'm pretty convinced that he never has the nut flush Because he's playing his hand people are more face up when they play multi way pots if there's his heads up He thinks maybe a little more about which which sizing my range wants and so on. Multi-wave people look down at their hand, which is a little more final. It's fine also, right? They look down at their hand and then they make what that hand wants to do. All right. So I go here for like some greedy value, try to, I don't know, represent some king diamonds, whatever. I know I'm never beat here. And in this instance, I actually get the call from the hand. Well, I mean, I knew it before I showed you that example, so it's unfair, but I knew I could tell you and you can trust me that I knew his hand in game also. Just like, well, like he really showed me his hand. I mean, and I say like he could have had like King 10, King Jack with a diamond also and probably false turn false turn then but now on the river he always had something like that. Preflop is absolute dog that overcall and the turn bet okay it can be okay just for the hand but it's just like incredibly face up and that way you can exploit it. Do you do an Damo and overbet river? Actually I'm'm incredibly value heavy in that spot. Probably not bluffing too much because I'm not attacking a range that is interested in the pot. Yeah. Okay, so cool here. Very important. If you call here, he will probably block that river again, then you go for the raise and then yeah, maybe he calls as well. But this way, we definitely get more money in the middle. And I think this is very important. So back to the slides, we were here examples. And I tried to write that down, right? So here, people tend like it's always in our system, knowing what villain is doing wrong, knowing the right exploit. People tend to play their hand versus multiple opponents. So especially multi way, lots of people start betting big on flops, let's say King-9-deuce with a flush draw. They take their pocket 9s and they blast it. So this is the time where you can fold, hero fold your top pairs already on the flop. In real multi-way situations, especially like 5-6-way in like live cash games, very important to not overvalue your absolute hand strength, right? strength right and make use of the fact that people just want to over protect and and and like expect you to call that king anyways and then they charge you and so on all right so big folds versus strength here i didn't face any big bets in the in the few multi-way pots i filtered i wanted to have an example there as well but I didn't find any I ran quite good so yeah but this is a very very clear one where just just the fact that we play multi-way makes their like makes it less likely they have bluffs and then there's only value left and they never go like big with like thin value or something okay then actually I wrote down the same thing again, this time not talking about value hands by the way. People tend to play their hand versus multiple opponents like the queen jack. You get away with out of range bluffs versus weakness. Oh, that was not the queen jack. That was the jack 10. But like if they block bet something small and so on, and it's like a board where you can represent something, they will believe you. They will believe you and they have the hand you expect them to have. People are not going for the block bet re-raise to be balanced like they learned from GTO Wizard in some heads up spots. Not saying that this is necessarily true and people learn, but yeah, you can be really sure that a small bet multi multiway is a weak value hand or maybe a cheap bluff okay then another and most important thing that fits a little to the pocket sevens even though there we didn't have any option but just add 100 big blinds to the stack on the river is that people overvalue absolute hand strength they see everything as a cooler even though in multiway situations it's not. If you have a straight and they can't fold their set for 200 big blinds or even 400 depending on the action it's just not a cooler. They just gave you a present. So make sure to get the maximum with your nuts and I should add here the fast playing. Nuts on the flop or nuts on the flop, not necessarily on the turn. Nuts on the river. Well, they are nuts. So make sure to get the maximum there and so on. All right. So this is just very important. No slow playing the five, six of diamonds, knowing their hand, more or less going for max value. Take it now, as long as, as there's value to be gained before there's a fourth diamond or I don't know, like deny equity, get value. That's it. So those are the main ones I want to write down here that you have a clear plan. And I hope you understood the explanation why I think out of line bluffs are especially fine multi-way. All right. Key takeaways. We talked a little about the in position, out of position and the sandwich situation, how we can split things up to get the incentives and understand and transfer things from spots we know from heads up play. So to make use of that, we need to know the spot we are in. Very important that you can tell me, are you freaking left wing, right wing or midfield? All right. Then understand the incentives each opponent is giving you, right? How should their range look like? How is like a big blind over calling range looking? How is like a cutoff flatting range looking? If the board is 6, 7, 8, just run, just like open fold your freaking aces. Like this is what I mean. Okay. Then multi-way pots can be wild west. Feel free to max exploit given reads, right? People believe in multiway pots if they don't have absolute hand strength, and they show you before and well, they play their hand strength. And now coming back to that article here that I give really, really big thumbs up. If you want to go deeper in the numbers and like the math behind it. Yeah, feel free to check out uh this one here from gto wizard i think it's it's already in the chat actually i can't copy paste it here but you see it that will be easy to google i think and yeah would be that let's call that the first add-on i didn't need to work anything for that but still i think it's a great one and i would recommend everyone who is like playing like NL25, NL50 plus, or is just interested, definitely check that out for deeper understanding. And yeah, that's it for today from me. And I'll think about some more add-ons I can add to dive a little deeper in the multi-way spots. And then we'll see each other in the forum or in Discord and in the next coaching, obviously, next month.
