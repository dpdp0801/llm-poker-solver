### TOPIC: cash postflop out of position adjustments
 So, okay, let's get things started. So today, we will talk about SignalRacer's pod and we are the OpenRaiser versus a flat call. I didn't know how to name that. I just want to make sure it's not blind versus blind. So I can tell you already, it's very close to a spot that we know just from gameplay wise, not ranges wise, that we talked about a lot. There's lots of stuff on the platform for the blind versus blind section, they wouldn't do. spot that we know just from gameplay wise, not ranges wise, that we talked about a lot. There's lots of stuff on the platform for the blind versus blind section. We didn't just talk about blind versus blind. We talked about every single line that exists in the game tree from all perspectives, because this is just where real poker is happening, wide ranges and so on. So I can tell you something already. we will take this as an orientation for lots of things and then apply that now to a very, very specific spot, which is actually very, very tough, but we'll get to that later. So actually, you see, I won't be talking much about strategy or GTO today because, yeah, it doesn't make sense in my eyes too much. So'll clarify the spot exactly i think i did that already but i will do it once more then next thing we'll talk about types of villains for a certain reason so we jump into exploitative thoughts right away so so for everyone who didn't attend too many coachings of mine or hasn't seen too many videos so far, I always think in three steps, what would be right? GTO sense, what is villain doing wrong? Second kind of thing, exploitative a little, and then what is the right exploit for us? Clearly exploitative. So we talk about types of villains, which in a way is the wrong starting point, right? So it's a little second point, what are villains doing wrong? But in this specific spot, I think it's the correct starting point. I will discuss that a little more when we get to that. Then we obviously talk about examples. I can already tell you, we won't see many hands today because it's really tough to find examples that are good, that we can learn from. Every example should have learning. If I want to show you one, I want to make points clear and this was very very tough in today's preparation. Then again, we will talk about potential exploits and then as always I'll leave you with some key takeaways to go out there and crush this specific spot okay then i stay in as a tourney player you should definitely if you have the time and you are here right now you should stay all right so let's go the spot we race first in in every position that is not the blinds or the button so So we are early position, middle position, cutoff. This can be six max. This can be nine max. We don't care. And someone flats and has position on us, right? This takes away the button from us. And I want to see the blind versus blind as something specific. It's kind of the same structure, the spot, if we open raise the small blind and the big blind flats, but just very, very different ranges in a way. So yeah, that's the spot. That's very very easy and then we get to types of villains. And yeah let's start with that, that building good flatting ranges from villains perspective is incredibly tough. This is the reason why it makes sense to think about their exact ranges a little deeper and i'll put out a phrase i use the hand triggers action right hand trigger sizing we talked about a lot which doesn't mean anything else but people look down at their two cards they do the move that comes up first in their mind. This is, we're not playing versus computers that are randomizing, that are doing this and that. Maybe some do that. Maybe the very best do that in a good way. But that's about it, right? People look down at their two cards. If Jerome just tells us he was 12 hours in the casino playing a live session, that's what everyone does there. This is what I mean with that. They look down at two cards and they do what pops up in their mind first, especially preflop. All right. So let me think. Do I put in examples here right away? So let's just do a very, very easy example to just make clear what I mean with that. I open raise the hijack. You sit on the button and you look down at pocket sevens. What is your first instinct what you are doing? Just type it in. Just type it in. Quick answer. You have pocket sevens. I open raise the hijack to a min raise. You look down at pocket sevens on the button. All right. Hardy calls. Dr. Seagy calls. Kid Cary calls. Nevada randomizes 50-50. Hell, you shit your pants when we're sitting there in the casino and you will end up calling. Will I get squeezed by blinds if not call? Right, so good thoughts here here three better call depending on blinds behind here we go right so you see like different answers but i asked for first instinct this is what you do because you're a study player you know what's going on but first instinct i think for everyone and still for me is i freaking click this call button and it's just very likely that pretty much everyone does that when i think let's go jump to that. Where is it? I always close the GTO wizard, which kind of sucks. So no study. All right, we have a spot. I said hijack, right? I said I open raise the hijack to min raise, cut off folds, button looks down, right looks down right here it's not 50 50 here it's like 86 14 where i should have said maybe tens or jacks then you would be a little more willing towards the three bet but it's just a hand that clearly triggers call for us where you can see hitting this is just what i mean we click on the call 8.8 percent it's just very tough to build a range like that, right? Mainly having those peers also cover the weaker peers, fold them often enough because having them all the time kills you when there are people squeezing behind, squeeze happy behind, and so on and so on. Okay, just to make clear what hand triggers action means. Let's get to those types of villains. Let's keep it very simple. I start with villain eight is a good wreck. He plays a real range. We want to be good wrecks. If we implement calls, we can simplify and play three bet only. That's also allowed depending on the rake structure, I would say, and maybe the skill level a real range for me this is why i make that here starts at like playing five percent everything else is just a bunch of combos just like a face up something range a real range just consists of multi a variety of hands like offsuit hands like some suited variation of hands to the connector suited ac suited kings other suited broadways pocket peers in the right distribution so it's like it sounds already a little tougher which will lead them to good board coverage when it's a stupid word good board coverage for me it means that we make some some amount of nuts on all kinds of boards or on most kinds of boards, boards. If we don't hit the deuce, deuce, deuce board, that's fine. But that we do fine on like a king 10-4, we do fine on a 7-6 deuce, we also do fine on a 10-9-8. Just like to have nuts in everything that can come up to be protected and to not be pushed around too much. This is the one thing. Good board coverage for me means we're talking about good hands. The other thing is find bluffs on all structures. Then we also have bad hands on all structures, which, well, is very, very important. If someone has too tight of a range that is centered around a couple of hands, well, when those hands hit, and it's quite obvious, we talked about the pocket sevens, let's just say there is a board like 8-7-6 and people never flat offsuit broadways, what are they bluffing with? They have so many nuts now, but what are they bluffing? Which means we can just freakingly check fold our aces or something, exaggerating, but we could do that if it's really extreme. That gives us like a good, very good playability also. So if villain is a good wreck, he has all that. And then we don't really need to worry about anything. Then we just play against some kind of computer, against some kind of bot or have some other reads, have some other reads right so we try to play solid and then well we i'm not talking about that too much today because it's not where we make the money it doesn't make sense so then we can we can train with gto wizard we can look up stuff there will be some small betting there will be an interesting delayed betting game tree and as i mentioned already we can look up things in all the coachings from blind versus blind right if we understand range structures we know how like turn cards change something after a check check how we should continue with betting there are lots of things in common i will give you a little guideline in the end how to make it a little easier to to find your starting point what your strategy is do you do lots betting, do you do lots of checking, and then you can go from there. But everything else is quite similar to the blind versus blind. All right, so important. We want to maximize our win rate, and therefore I'm not talking about playing against the toughest players, against the good players. We will more be talking about the bad players. Let's start with a not so bad player, but a kind of bad player, right? This is villain number B. Or is it a number? No, B is not a number. How you call it? Villain B. It's a bad wreck. And I mean bad in the tight sense, right? So he suffers the hand triggers action syndrome. This will end like it's the opposite thing from the last slide pretty much. This will end up with bad board coverage and also that he smashes some boards and completely misses other boards. So what I mean with that, I want to like make that very very very clear and therefore i'm just quickly opening pile viewer right so for all the newcomers for all poker beginners that is not important you don't need those programs you can at some point start with gto wizard if you want to look deeper into that stuff this is just me using it for you now and i have some some safe ranges some certain range structure, absolutely not important. The point is this here. This here is a button flatting range versus a cutoff. The first example I asked you for hijack versus button, this is button facing a cutoff range, and this is only the hands that we flat. So we should flat 18% of our pocket deuces. We should flat 54% of our pocket sevens. So maybe my example should have been a little button versus cutoff to hit your 50-50 randomizations in the first question. And now what happens if people follow their first instincts all the time? Also different reg, yeah. Maybe just one sentence, a couple of words. What happens if people only play after their instincts, their first instincts? This can be no decision making, multi-tabling, right? A bad tight regs, I think about those those guys for tabling zoom 50 for tabling zoom 100 adding two tables of zoom 50 they will end up with way more flats they call deuces through to nines pure maybe yes passive players take passive note aggressive players take aggressive note yeah we should. That's interesting, right? So aggressive players will maybe not flat a lot. And what I mean with that, I need it. Sorry, guys, I didn't plan it, but we're opening up paint here. Hold low percentage pure. So I have this here in mind. So they have often two decisions. The decision is, first thing is they know they VP IP, then they have a decision between call and 3-bet. The second thing is they are not sure whether they VP IP and then they have a decision between fold and call. Not many hands are fold or 3-bet, that's maybe in the big blind, but not in those positions. So they have those decisions. When it is like this, this is when your feeling tells you it's close. Pocket jacks, pocket tens, do a clearly three-bet. I don't know. It's nice, but what if, and so on. Pocket sixes, you look down and you're like, eh, call or whatever. Whatever is a clear call here. There's some folds going on as well. So this year is where Instinct tells you whatever. And people are actually mixing those. But there are spots where it's not here. It's not like 50-50. It's like here. It's like an 80-20 what we had before or even an 85-15. And this is something human feeling just can't. This is actually study-based. So human feelings are very, very bad with percentages when it's like, what's the difference between 70-30, 85-15, whatever. And people want to have clear things. So we just round, our instincts round to 0 or 100. So what is very, very clear here is if something is 85-50, and our feeling just by nature rounds that to 100. So it's like if something is 85% a call and 15% a 3-bet, our head tells us to call. Which is right, 85% of the time. But what is clear that we miss those three bets. When it's 50-50, I agree with Kit Carry here the most. We're like, that's a type thing, right? Aggressive players will more often take the aggressive route, obviously. Then they end up maybe 75% or 100 100 percent three betting and passive players end up doing the passive thing but here the nature of this is is absolutely that people they do not necessarily find the 15 three bets right so it's it's just that will end up to like what i asked you first instinct pocket sevens they call right and this just shows us that this gets moved. Boom, this will get moved to here. And we end up with a call. And the other way around, right? If something is like a 15% call or something, maybe not here. Maybe it's against the hijack where you should flat ace king sometimes. It's the other way around. People end up three betting every single time because time because it's freaking A-K, right? You should do that and so on. Maybe we have it here a little different. Then we take the GTO wizard again. It depends really. You can play around with those ranges, whatever is convenient. It depends on the game here, right? Cutoff versus button. Let's the, let's take the hijack versus button hijack to have a better example maybe. Like, yeah, those 10% ace king, 12% unlikely. The 30% call with queen's button versus hijack. I have to admit the last hundred times I found queen's button versus hijack, I did three bet those. Like for sure. Maybe I timed out once, but I try not to. So I definitely did three bet. So this is my explanation for why ranges look different. And for those bad players, right? There are good players out there. They know their shit. They do that. That's okay. I got to accept that, but there is no EV to be made. And now I just want to do a little game. Let's say everything between 35 and 65 people are really having that feeling that it's that it's kind of uncertain and they actually end up mixing even the bad regs because they know. But if we find something now that is over 65 percent we'll give it a 1, 100%. And if something is under 35%, I'll just give it a 0. And we just see what happens to that range. So what I'm doing now is just I'm looking. I click on weight here and I take everything that is less than 35%. I just kill it. People should know this is a fold button versus cutoff. Most of the time you just need it for board coverage. If you are freaking eight tabling zoom, you just fold that. You fold that. You fold that. I just made 35 a line. That is a random number. It's gone. It's gone. It's gone. Maybe this is a three bet. I don't know whether people fold that. Just for the sake of the purpose here. this is gun this is gonna ace five makes the cut everyone knows that gun gun this makes the cut makes the cut makes the cut gun probably three bet all the time three bet all the time this year this year re-bet always three bet boom boom boom and this is the range you end up with and if you played a gazillion hands already like I did over the last ten years there should be something familiar with you guys because this is I think in reality way closer to the range we actually face button versus cutoff this is happening right let's do the other thing, there is no 65. So I don't need to take a one to be honest, right? Let's let's, let's, for the sake of the of the example, again, let's let's do it with a 50. Right there, we see, okay, if it's over 50%, people are just freaking calling. And that's it, right there, we have higher weight also. Yeah, looks like like my range jerome says so definitely looks like the ranges of every casino game of like some nitty rex there a little more calls with suited stuff position and post flop edge so because we are obviously on average if we play the right games better than our opposition we can play a little more a little more hands that are shown as slightly minus EV. That should be fine. Maybe this is a time where someone needs to ask a question. I really want to make that clear because this is not something I'm making up. This is just a very, very logical thing where wrong ranges come from. This is why it is the case that ranges are like that. It's a very natural thing. This is how the human brain works, that we take percentages and simplify them. Or it's not us. It's actually the incentive, the instinct. It's like, what is it called? Unconsciously. So I hope I tried to make that clear and you understand why everything can be very different in this exact spot because the effect is very very big. We are talking very tight ranges. Here you see what I did is we have I did I did increase that frequency so I did increase something but I obviously took away quite a bit. So I have a 2.8% range here. Let's double check again what it was. I go back to the original one. It was a 4.3% range, right? Way more board coverage. And now you can think, okay, this might get crazy, right? What happens if the board is like is like deuce three five and i know he doesn't have fives threes deuces nor ace four suited well i can take my freaking pocket nines and overbet the shit out of him like i have the best hand right now if he doesn't have tens all right let me have a look to be right something interesting i would not expect a player would make a difference between deuces and sixes. So we talk about players that try to beat the game and follow some chart and simplify it. Do you see that happening from your coaching experience? Absolutely. I'm really talking about those guys. They can break even and win at Zoom 100. For them, those close spots, they're hunting fish. For the close spots, R0EB for them and they have their charts and they know that and they are on purpose clicking those away because why should they care about the board coverage there? They'd rather play the next hand and play for some rake back and so on. There are lots of people that grind that shit. So maybe it's a little less happening or less multi-tabling on the normal tables, but this is definitely like a Zoom thing, a Russian Cash thing where people go for volume. They leave those tiny things away. It's zero EV, it doesn't make a difference, but it changes your range. And this is what we are talking about today with the example of a very, very, very, very tiny range. We're talking about 4% here. It's not actual 4%, right? Because it's way more hands than that. It's just the frequency, right? If I took all the hands that are sometimes taking place, I take now every hand that is more than 10%, right? That are actually showing up in that range. This is board coverage, right? So just seeing, okay, all those hands will be in there. And then we talk about like a 15% range, like 15% of hands. It's not a 15% range, but 15% of hands will be in that range, right? This is kind of a different where I said before I have a 5% line in a way right so if I say this is my flatting range I will tell you this is not a range right even if you add that that's not a range that's two percent that's nothing right so just mixing in some things can be good it's right if people do not adjust it doesn't matter if they still pay you off on seven,, 8, 9 and they can't let go, well that's fine. But you should understand that actually you're missing the bluffs. You can't just check fold the shit out of it and make money. On other boards like deuce 3, 4 with that range you have nothing. Villain can just adjust strategy and kill you. Okay. So I tried to make that clear. This is very important to understand. Because you can take that for other spots as well. Just as a logical thing. When there is like an 80-20. Your instinct will make it a 100-0. Whether you want or not. If you multitable and you are not really actively actively thinking while clicking the preflop buttons okay oops good where is it easier for people to click call when you 2x early position as well well that's that's what most of the charts do without anti whether it's 2x 2.2x, yeah, 3x is maybe a strategy for really weaker games where people clap too much, which brings us perfectly to Villain C. Keep the questions coming, happy to have them going and answer all of them. Villain C is the loose recreational, right? And actually, I'm not making those up, right? Actually, I looked through my database and double checked the kind of hands I was facing and the player types. So there is some preparation in that and not just random thoughts. Villain C is the loose recreational who you will face in the casino, who you might face on normal tables more than on Zoom tables, because they sit there, they play one table, they want to play hands. But unfortunately, they don't get dealt premium hands too often so they like to play hands pre-flop mainly passively that's a big plus for us and then he gets to post flop with a weak range that's the one you want to open raise bigger against because you want to play against just this player and his mistake is just way bigger if he flats his king 10 offsuit against a 3x, it gets way better for you than if he flats it against your min-raise. So what is important here is that you evaluate your value correctly and you need to adjust from kind of the theory game as well. We're like 7-6-5 board, which is incredibly dangerous against a reasonable range and the clearest range check board of all times, well maybe you could just value bet against that guy, hold out his queen-jack offsuit, king-10 offsuit, get called by all the one-peer hands. It's very very different. I didn't want to run crazy sims and using GTU, O-Wizard doesn't make any sense here. So this is what we need to understand is someone flooding like here the four or five percent range that that i've shown you in one O-Wizard doesn't make any sense here, right? So this is, we need to understand is someone flatting like here, the four or 5% range that, that I've shown you in one way, the face up way, or in the good mixed way that for board coverage, where someone's playing 20% of his hands. This is something that is easy to find out, especially when you're not playing the zoom format, right? You see someone flat ace five offsuit on the button, you know this is your man, right? Perfect, here we go. And well, this just changes everything because then all the theory you might have made regarding that spot is just wrong. It's not your opening, let's say, cutoff 28% opening range versus 7-8% flatting range. No, it's your 28 versus the potential 20% that is capped on the top end, right? Because still, those type of people still fight the race button with like Queens, Kings, Aces, or they should, obviously everyone is different. So this is important to understand. Going one step back, the spot we are talking about today is very, very very very special a because it's a very tight range and every mistake people are doing has dramatic uh influence on our post-flop game and whenever we get into that spot especially when people are not flatting the button when people are flatting the cutoff or the hijack. Ranges get way tighter. It's a high chance that they are way more face up. Most regs I know are not flatting at all from those positions. So this is your chance to find out is there money in that spot or do I try to play like some proper okay poker. But it's very likely if someone flats hijack or cutoff that he's either a bad rec who has pocket nines or like, this is really, I mean it. Like if you have those spots and you just put him on eights and nines, usually you're doing better than if you think about some kind of range and so on and so on and he might bluff and bullshit, right? So just putting him on the three hands that are first instinct calls in those positions is probably very good idea or is that someone who sits there with his freaking king jack offsuit we will see examples regarding that later so we'll see loose recreational so this is the first thing no clue how 30 minutes pass pass so right now but yeah i want you to make that difference. Good rec, forget about it. It's not no ego. We don't need to beat that guy. Like just not losing, not losing much is fine. Make more money versus villain B. Make a lot of money versus villain C. That's our goal. And find tables where we find those guys. Okay, let's get to the next thing. Keep the questions coming. Examples. Thank you. tables where we find those guys. Okay, let's get to the next thing. Keep the questions coming. Examples. I copied that from the last presentation where I had lots of examples, but actually I don't have a single one and I want to explain to you because we will have different kinds of examples. So it's a very tough spot for good examples because whatever hand I show you, I need tell you is that player type A, player type B player type C, player type I don't know yet I don't know the range we play against and therefore my playstyle is kind of random I will take and this is what I do and always did in game when I don't know better I transfer everything I know with some small guidelines for that spot from more known spots which I mentioned already is for you guys here everything blind versus blind if you want to dig deeper into strategy there go to the to the c-betting section of that go to the delayed betting section to the double barreling section then we have all of that the whole game tree is there with i think very very good coachings and examples so this should do all right and now we get to the first i have two two things i want to do first thing i think is the most fun i need you either with an excel sheet or with a pen and a paper or a Word document, whatever. So example number one is hands at showdown. I just want to prove you that those player types are for real. So what I did here is I filtered for the last whatever 200,000 hands I played, I don't know what this database is here for exactly that spot. And I clicked randomly. Is it random? No, I sorted by time. So it's not like any VP IP, not anything. And I filtered for hands where I've seen the showdown. So obviously, this is a little biased to see the showdown. Maybe we see some hands more often. And now we will see a couple of things. We will always see the hands people flat with and get to showdown with, to be honest with that. And it's interesting how often we see player type C. And it's not that I'm like Cray or at this this time you see most of the hands are actually from 22 that I did game select well like not at all it was really shit with game selection especially around that time after moving to Vienna I was just grinding every rec table as well so yeah we will see how often that happens if we get into that spot because most regs are playing 3-bet only. And then you can even see maybe make extra... I'll do that actually here. I think this is pretty good to just see what's going on for the next time that someone flats versus you. So we will go for the... This here is 50 hands. Why is it... Like why can I count like three times faster in German than in English? This is sick. Okay, so... I think this is tough on the side. Yeah, this will always disappear. So I need you to do it. Maybe we write down the bullshit hands. Right? So first hand, I open race. This is some bullshit 10 BB game. Anyways, let's count it. First, definitely player type C, right? This is number one. I'll write it down here on the side actually. So player type C. C is one. Just quickly do it. Threes doesn't tell us anything. This is a good drag. Can be good. Can be face up. I don't know. Doesn't tell us anything. King-10 suited doesn't tell us anything. Four deuce suited, this guy's obviously shit. Very, very easy. Pocket 5s can be anything. 9-7 suited with 30 big blinds, this is obviously bullshit. Ace-Queen offsuit, just again the very, very clear hands. Ace-Queen offsuit. Pocket 8s. Pocket 10s. Ace-Queen offsuit. Oh, King- queen offsuit oh king ten offsuit hello sir this is obviously super bullshit ace and I don't see your chat right now yeah okay super standard hand pocket fives ace three suited in the cutoff okay might be a real range who knows with that sex size more likely that this player is bullshit but i won't count it king jack offsuit okay we give some low frequency for that ace eight offsuit i mean with the post limb we just i mean i had i count this one bullshit six five. 6-5 suited can be arranged. King-queen offsuit can be arranged. King-queen offsuit can be arranged. Ace-8 offsuit in the cutoff is obviously bullshit. Ace-5 offsuit is obviously bullshit. Again, interestingly, on NL 10K. Jack-7 suited. Maybe Jerome can flat that in the Dutch casinos, but I think on NL 5k, GG, you shouldn't do that on a solid table. Ace-9 suited, super standard. 6-7 suited can be a real range. Pocket queens with 15 big blinds, cutoff versus early position. I don't write it down. This is a solid hand, but obviously this guy is a not good player. King-queen suited, can be arranged. Pocket sixes, exactly what we expect. Pocket eights. King-seven suited. This is a borderline call. Like, this is included in the read range, but so far we have seen eights, sixes, sevens, fives, ace-queen offsuit, ace-queen offsuit, ace-queen offsuit. Just to show you what's going on there. Jack-ten offsuit, this guy is obviously king jack offsuit i'll give that a range this solid guy queen ten offsuit is obviously again has to be a recreational ace jack offsuit mp versus early position is obviously shit. Ace-queen, so this is nice. Okay, so okay, things are getting good. Ace-ten, ace-king suited in this position, okay, if you want to play that. Cutoff, didn't I tell you? Cut off an MP. We just put them on 8s and 9s. I'm not sure. Again here the ace-jack offsuit is obviously horrible. I'm at 14 right now. 9-7 suited is number 15. That is absolute bullshit. Pocket 4s, what we expect. Ace-queen off, what we expect. Queen 9 suited. This is number two of the borderline good calls that should sometimes happen. Ace-8 offsuit is obviously not a good player. Okay, that's it. All right, so 50 hands, 17 times I counted bullshit. So we had 17 types, 17 times we had someone who is clearly not a good player. And the others, we found exactly what I tried to show you that we did here, right? So we have seen lots of, I mean, it's now a mix of let's take hijack versus button for the example, makes it a little better because I had a mix between me being under the gun, MP and cutoff. So I think taking MP is the fairest thing for the example that we take. We have seen pocket eights. We have seen pocket sevens, sixes, fives. We have seen a lot of ace queen. We have seen, I said the queen nine suited. Don't know the exact position, but we have seen one of those. We've seen the, maybe it was ace three suited and a king seven suited, which is good, but versus cutoff. But I say like the borderline thing, they didn't, like two people didn't cut it away. And the other thing is exactly all that we expected. We've seen actually some king jack offsuit, but of like some 20 BB guy, I just didn't count him as bullshit bullshit and we have seen some ace jack offsuit king queen offsuit also so it's exactly this year no surprises i i don't think we we have oh the seven nine two we've seen it in the cutoff so i gave it a bullshit but that's about it right very very very very face up if we give them just those offsuit hands a little and those hands and if we can make the difference between players who are player type A, good regs, who can have everything or almost everything, and player type B where we just know even more that they have 6s, 7s, 8s and maybe 9s, that's it, right? And we can focus on cutoff and MP flats. So why did I do that? I want to show you that most of the time some of the flats versus you it's likely he's shit 33 of the time and this is random i didn't make that up so someone was bullshit right so even if you haven't have when you know this guy obviously this can be wrecked sure and then you put him on like a certain range but if you don't know someone and he starts cutoff, it's very, very likely that he either has pocket eights and nines or he's bullshit. And this is how I want to treat it because there's a high, high, high chance that we are missing lots of value if we just misinterpret that spot. It's not like he's a fish maybe and we wait five more rounds until we have seen him limp or do something stupid. No. With that small sample example, it's 33% chance right now that he's absolute bullshit. Do you have a lot of type B on Zoom 500? I did have. I did have the majority, all of them, back then. Right now Zoom 500 is almost not running, so it's more... When I see it running, it's one fish and like some actually really good players. So these days I wouldn't say it, but these days you can clearly say it for Zoom 100. Very, very typical thing, I would say. Maybe Jerome, I don't know whether you do play some 100, 200 these days, or whether you can confirm that because I'm just sometimes playing that for some videos, but I don't get to play that much. I actually played yesterday a bit and it absolutely felt like exactly what I was expecting. Purely live while that hurts. But yeah I mean it's just because it's not a trend. It's not people do this right now people will do that in in five years. No, I tried to explain to you why that is happening. People have the stuff to learn their ranges. And then what happens is just a natural way of thinking of missing those randomizations. If something is 80-20, the brain will always trigger the 80% as the 100%. It's just the first instinct, and especially when you are under time pressure. Let's say you have a spot somewhere else. You look on the bottom right table at pocket sevens. You click call before you think anything. So it's just very, very likely that this will always stay like that. Would you say people who flat on button are wider includes offsuit hands in other positions will lean more to pop cuts and suit connectors? Yes. And I want to be more drastic because the mistake, like obviously I'm exaggerating a little, but the mistake of not doing it is potentially way higher. If someone flats cutoff versus you, just put him on sevens, eightss and nines i think you'll play better on average than anything else it sounds so stupid but yeah ace king deuce one big bet they are out or medium bet whatever do whatever you want right value bet whatever it is. Ace, King, Queen, it down you freaking min bet the shit out out of it on the river and either get the fold or they call it down with sevens eights and nines just really put them on hands the tighter the ranges on the button maybe take a look at the big blind if they somehow seem to be a wreck on the button then obviously a fish can influence a recreational in the big blind can influence the button range a lot this is what i'm looking for i'm not flatting the button that much but i'm flatting a lot when there are weak players in the big blind just to get involved this is where i think the value comes from really looking for this player type c this is where the money comes from whether you play a little too wide or a little too loose we had coaching for that whether it's shown in GTO wizard as minus 0.01 or plus 0.01 doesn't mean anything doesn't mean anything because it's way more about post flop edge or like big mistakes that are happening so very good question and and I hope very clear answer. OK, let's go back to that. Example number two. How I split boards. I told you I want to give you a small guideline. And I want to just like, my guideline is nothing else but that. A deeper look at high frequency sets for villain. If the board is monotone, flushes are there. We can forget about the sets. That's it. If there's a straight, depends. Can they have it? If they have lots of ace-queen offsuit, well, then king-jack-ten is not great. But they won't cover many straights. They don't have just a variety of offsuit hands. And if they have like 20% of the suited combo, so be it.. So looking for the sets one big chunk of their calling range is pocket pairs. So look for the sets and now it's just a very very clear thing it's actually tough to show with GTO Wizard but it has to do with nut advantage. So every set you flop counts right now kind of as nuts. Since the button range is not... So here the problem... I have to talk a little more. Since the button range is nicely constructed with all kinds of things, it's not that face up just 9s, 8s and 7s. But still we can have a look. Let's take this hijack versus button as example to have high frequency of a certain pocket pair, and then we have... This is what I mean with the high frequency pocket pair, by the way, right? So I should explain that. It means 9s, 8s, and 7s are high frequency. 6s also. Pocket 3s I wouldn't count. 3s and deuces, because in theory they have it less. We are only interested in actual ranges, so everything you know you have to put in there. So I don't say like 9s, 8s and 7s, I say high frequency pocket pairs. If there's an 8 and 7 on the board you're just fucked right? So let's have a look right what is the case if we have like three high frequency pocket pairs in Villain's range. Okay, we obviously end up checking. Let's have a look why. Look at the breakdown here because, oh there's even a straight possible, right? They have a set just 7% of the time and now if you're a little deeper, you play poker a little longer and you know about stack-to-pot ratio and how it works with the betting and minimum defense frequency, you should know that in those spots, you only need to stack off like about 10%. So let's think about if you start value betting for stacks and villain only needs to call down about 10% and already 7% of their hands are sets right now. Well, you know, you cannot value bet a bottom set for stacks on that board against that range. And what do you want to build a pot for them, right? If like, just doesn't make sense. Villain is just way stronger. He has more nuts, right? I should have made it something without a straight to make it to make it more clear i i i up nope not not the small bank called fold fold let's make it 986 shouldn't change too much just that we see it a little better check strategy very clear strategy again and the button breakdown we see the 7.2% nuts at 0.8% two pair. This is here. If they hit some suited 9.8, that's not much. It really doesn't change much. That's about it. So we have one first clear thing. If there are three of those, we range check. It's villain's board, range check board. We should know that from Blind vs. Blind already. If not, check out the Blind vs. Blind section, this is all you need for spots like that. Now, let's change something. Make this a king, a beautiful card for out of position, having ace-king, king-queen advantage and so on. We can start maybe betting a little bit and now the sets are five percent maybe i make it eight seven then there's some two pair added and sevens are a little higher frequency we get a little more towards high frequency checking actually i'm surprised how much betting there is right actually i can tell you that big bets are not allowed at all and we could actually range check that also without ev loss right so i can can tell you that the even here if we run it in in pyro and do our own sims there's not a single hand that prefers betting over checking so it really doesn't matter ev won't change if we just check everything and i'm a big fan of that sitting actually changing positions a little by checking first. I feel like I'm playing a little bit more in position, see what comes first. And now implementing what we talked about today, I think that people have sevens and eights more often than they should have while they are lacking other hands. They have sevens and eights just all the time but not necessarily the queen nine suiteds that they bluff. Okay, I think there should be quite some check raising after range check going on usually. Would you still be doing that versus those human ranges or end up check calling if continuing basically? To my needs, absolutely to my needs. So depending on the board, I'm like six, seven six seven eight i get it in with nuts like no chance i don't give him a chance to to turn a nine and not lose his stack with pocket sixes so i'm check raising the shit out of it when it when i have pocket eights i think i start over folding right away let's go back to that let's do the what wasn't let 7, 6 to get rid of the straight, the higher frequency straight. Let's first have a look how it should be played, right? Obviously, big time stabbing here. All kinds of sizes are fine. Let's take the half pot as a trade-off size here. All right, 9s. There's a reason. Get the money in now. 7s, kind of. 6s, no. You don't want to get the money in now versus 7s and 9s. 10-8 wants to get the money in now. 7s kind of, 6s no, you don't want to get the money in now versus 7s and 9s. 10-8 wants to get the money in. The bluffs and those kind of equity denial is okay to check raise, is okay to check call. I'm not doing that much just because I think I have less fold equity. not first of all I expect people to have a range centered more around that 976. So they are on average stronger. And the other thing, I don't think people understand how strong a board is like that only for that example to start bluffing enough. Do people bluff all their ace five, ace four,4, ace-3 here? Do they bluff ace-queen like 50% plus of the time? I highly doubt it. Do they understand that steerboard? They step just like 85% of a king-queen and king-jack. And this is where our value comes from if we check-raise. Like something like queen-10 or like queen-jack backdoor or even the pocket jacks. Folding out king queen is a big success ace queen is a big success and then we go from there on the turn while right now it's maybe more of just building a pot being out of position so kind of yeah my my idea towards that yeah that's that's the anti thing nick mini it's just you have such a different price, right? I have no trouble, no trouble to switch over to MTT because it's very, very, very, very interesting. MTT. Oh, why does it take so long? Let's play more like 60 big blinds, maybe. Hijack, oops, open raises. And button. You're not pure, right? But all that shit. And now we have a totally different spot. I was talking about a tight range that everything that is different than it should be changes the range dramatically. Here we have a 17% range. If you change that a bit, well, it's still a range that naturally covers almost everything. So in MTT poker, it's way more interesting to play well post-flop than because we don't know people's hands, right? We can more say like, okay, let's go back to the blind versus blind section i hope you'll like that one maybe check that one out where actually we from the cash game side also play a wide range versus a wide range right even way wider obviously than like our opening 24 or something versus a 17 range it will be like 43 versus i don't even know how much the big blind flats but way closer to that and here it's like we are not small mistakes don't change the shape of the range that much and this is the the core thing of today's coaching that when we have already tight ranges and people do something wrong we can really fuck them up that's kind of the idea with 100 it might be pure right for 100 it should be obviously more interesting right let's what do we say if it's over 50 we just we just go 100 no but yeah we can change something and we'll be all right maybe it's a min race instead of 2.3 and then we have it easily all right would you say as a whole you approach the spot as reaction game despite being pre-flopor? Absolutely. First of all, reaction game to villain's range. I need to find out that range. And then when I have the disadvantage, I like to switch into reaction game to get further information because people misplay that spot as well. If I know their range and it's my board, hell no, we are going into reaction game. We are blasting. So if we understand that, let's now find a spot that is naturally good for us that I can actually look at it in GTO wizard. I don't want to play like freaking heatmax. Why is it laggy? Not simplified, general, not simplified. Smaller. I don't know what's going on here. Let's take this one. So hijack raises, button flats. It should be a reasonable range. I don't know whether it's the exact same I used before but shouldn't shouldn't matter. And we can have a quick look, right? I'll take an example of a board that is very good for us. Here let's go with the slide. Deeper look at high frequency sets. On deuce, deuce, deuce, it's impossible to have a set, which means zero high frequency sets, which has to be good for us having the overpair advantage. And we see just a very interesting 47% overbetting frequency. So everything is possible. If you know that villain is not protected as he should be with flatting lots of jacks and tens, you can go even a little crazier, right? Why not? If people are missing some other, like an ace-queen draw here, and he sits on more like eight, seven, sixes all the time, you can go even crazier, right? Just imagine what can come that you are not freaking stacking off with all kinds of bullshit, right? If he sits here with sevens, good luck calling down, you will improve so often. If he has ace queen, well, you don't like ace and queen that much. Even after overbetting, king can change things, and so on. If he sits on jacks, it's not that great to take your 10-9 and then hit a 10 or a nine, and so on, right? Just understanding how a shift of villain's range in which direction whatsoever can change things. So let's quickly have a look here. What else happens is just a selected post-op spot over here. We can look at different boards and there we see a typical thing. The high boards are obviously okay for out of position to put small bets in. The pocket pairs have to fold a lot. And the low boards, you see more here, nine high and lower. This is all the sets. This is all the range checks. You see some of those. This will be the deuce, deuce, deuce, 3-3-3, 4-4-4, something like that. Or the paired boards, like a 6-6 deuce has no high frequency sets, right? 6s is one combination of quads and deuces is not a high frequency flat, something like that, right? We could find, but here you see the green almost 100% all the time. 9 high boards, 8 high boards, 7 high boards, and everything else, like obviously 10 high and 9 high already starts that there is one guaranteed high frequency set. And then like king and queen that villain almost never has is the good cards where we still will work with small bets and then there's like some ace king deuce type of things where we will have big bets also when there's just like zero right zero high frequency sets what happens here wow this is laggy and weird today and something like that ace king deuce sure small betting can attack villain he doesn't have deuces very often so we can also go big and charge his whatever okay so it's about a tip a typing one more guy typing just waiting a bit yeah and until we get there really this is what i do right one card is kind of a trade-off like like a king-8-deuce, something like that, a king-queen-8. It's a lot playing around with a blocker right to give you some ideas what you can what you can dig deeper into let's make it like a king queen deuce we can do damage no high frequency set boom this is how it looks very easy but higher frequency than on the Ace high because it's worth something to fold out villains Ace highs. We make it a King Queen 8 instead. Villain has pocket 8s. Still almost that. Let's change it to Ace Queen 8. We might see some big betting. Or not. Okay, well is it the flush draw? I thought some big betting should be should be good using some of the blockers then I was just wrong that's okay so we start small and then probably go a little bigger right the only high frequency set this is kind of a trade-off look at all the hands like they just don't care if you look at the individual hands do they want to bet or not like they absolutely don't care this is what is a definition of a trade-off board and then we go from there playing position or not, do we gain information or not. Okay and then once we have two of the high frequency sets, this is the ones that hurt the most, some straight connectivity is also bad for us, the ace is bad for us in the sense that the hands we we have the offsuit hands like king queen king jack king 10 are like close to zero percent equity against anything so against an ace especially that's just very very bad so it's like a king eight seven is way better for us because villain has quite some ace highs as well right so just to understand that right but this is a working a with that, understanding a little with that, and the difference between putting a small bet out there and check is actually not too much. So just like two plus of those high frequency sets are enough if you really want to simplify to just go for the range check. Would you have such a high checking frequency on ace-queen-eight rainbow versus those face-up ranges though? I'd say way higher CBF frequency, right? Exactly, right? They will be missing their suited aces. They will be missing their, I don't know, king-jack off-suits. And they have the hands that are not hitting way more often, right? So the player type, let's talk about player type B, the bad rack. They will even overfold flops and so, right is just typical. They look down ace, queen, eight. Actually, if I'm not multi-tapling, I would put out an even smaller bet. Just hold out their sevens and sixes. I know what's happening. I know their hands. I don't like that usually, that I bet with a certain goal. I bet to make him fold a certain hand right usually i try to make players indifferent but this player type i know he has sevens and sixes and nines i make him fold that right now and then i can go from that on the turn and then even he will raise eights if he just calls and the turn is a deuce it's a safe card i can start over betting and I win. It's like very very face up and I can implement all that into my post-flop game. King, eights and rainbow. In which line do you think ace, five suited, backdoor flush draw over performs versus humans? In the check fold with a delayed betting game tree. just they hit eights and sevens too often. And there's not much snap fold equity betting now. And building a pot, therefore, your hand is too weak, in my opinion. Kind of nuanced, but what about peered boards? I imagine it comes down to trip advantage. Yes. Depends. There are some boards where no one has trips. On 6-6-2s, it's absolutely not about trips. You have A6 suited, maybe they have it. Sometimes 6-7, do they have it? Do they not have it? On queen-queen something, obviously everyone can have it. But there, any information is good. And again, until you have better information that he raises or so on, put them on sixes, sevens, and eights and nines, and you do a great job extracting value or bluffing correctly. So let's make two examples for that. Let's go to the king direction. Where's the king king? Something like a king king six is a beautiful beautiful example. Okay, works like that. We can do small betting to just fold out like some nine eight suiteds. We can do bigger betting to already put pressure on sevens, eights, build a pot and so on because we have king ten, we have king jack, we have king queen offsuit and villain has less king x. Here you see it's a frequency thing he should have like 30 percent of that does he have it does he not have it does he have it more or not it's very very interesting and then something like the what did i say let's take this example six six deuce i think we use more bigger bets to win money now with our pens jackss, or actually, well, we do lots of check raising, I guess. All our broadways miss. That's kind of a problem because we can't go too crazy. Villain should do quite some stabbing with all the peers. Villain has more peers relative to his range. And then we take the ones that we want and go for the check raise or start with the big bet. Understanding the size i always say this big bet and check raise our brothers or sisters and you can it's kind of what you do doesn't matter low pair report probably big size because overbear advantage not means that's right but not go crazy because actually you miss a lot right all that has no connectivity whatsoever and you have that offsuit shit a bunch and villain very, very rarely. We have seen it in the 50 hands. I just browsed through. There was not much offsuit shit going on. Obviously, if you have a player type C sitting there with queen 10 offsuit all the time, then it's an absolute different show. All right. I'll move on and keep the questions coming. I'll just move on here. So we haven't seen a single hand I've played, but I hope I explained well why I don't think that makes sense. And yeah, exploitative thoughts. People deviate big time from reasonable ranges. Big time in the sense of the effect it has on their range. It's very easy to miss a lot of things there because you need to structure it so well if you want to execute very well. Especially in middle position and cutoff. If we did those browsing of 50 hands or 100 hands showdowns or 200, if we would do that a little more in depth, then we would even see that the percentage of player type C of recreationals is even way bigger when they flat MP or the cutoff. Like way more you see shit there because those ranges do not really exist for people who study. So this is just what I want you to understand once you leave that session. So first thing is now, not that you tell anyone, oh, I'm so good at SingRay's pot out of position, I wasn't Stefan's coaching. No, you have a job. You have a job. You need to find out player types. And you now have the knowledge to understand why things are happening and what they are doing. So max value for you in the sense when you play against player type C. They have shithands. They have like a king-8 offsuit. We have seen ace-8 offsuit. We have seen four-deuce offsuit. This shit is happening. So don't be scared. Don't go for range checks if you have that. You have the stronger range in the end. Whatever, even if the board is 7, 8, 9. Or the other way around, especially type B if their hands hit the board accept it get rid of your aces get rid of your kings get rid of your queens like no reason to pay like two or three streets to a set turn folds are beautiful boy what happened to the camera all right refocus yeah right turn folds are beautiful or falling to big bets on the flop can be great. Then the knowledge about ranges now that I tried to give you is I want you to transfer that over to turns and rivers. Check, check and a seven appears and he raises you on the turn. He has pocket sevens. It's that easy. He has pocket sevenss and nothing else he has a very high frequency in his range it makes a lot of sense and if he finds the once in a lifetime bluff then good for him or if you continue right if you have that pattern of really we bet to achieve something that i like on the exploitative side but not in general. If I do this to fold out sevens and sixes and turn is a six or a seven, well, let's go. It's your job now. They don't have it anymore. You did fold that out. Especially in delayed spots, it's just like those delays. It's a difference whether there's a deuce falling or a seven or a six or an eight, no matter the board. Okay. Okay, so key takeaways. Find out villain's player type once more. Evaluate range strength accordingly post-flop. A six, seven, eight board is a beautiful pocket aces check fold. I've done those already. And I think they can be really beautiful. And I don't know whether this can be a thing, a grill. No when to chill, no when to grill. You can start on the flop with that. Is that something to go crazy or not? Is it your board? Is it villain's board? Is it the typical range check or range bet? There are so many spots, especially with face-up ranges, that you know this is yours or this is his because usually when both people have board coverage it's maybe like that it's a little it's your board it's a little it's my board and then we kind of work around everything this is like it's my board it's your board if you're just like if you just just imagine you you only play sixes and sevens and And the is seven six deuce well you should like you should check fold every other hand like or a villain should fold every hand this you have a set we know it or you only play sevens and sixes and the board is ace king queen well obviously you min bet everything or i don't know right is min bet the right thing if you bet everything or when you have a set you let him catch up wait for a seven to six or i don't know what the real strategy then is but yeah that's kind of the idea that people can be very face up or it can be way wider than they should um it's lots of room in those spots and maybe i didn't i forgot to write that Maybe the most important thing, when they flat, think about how likely it is that they are shit. That's usually just pretend it. Pretend it more often than not that they are shit and you will do fine. That's kind of the idea. All right, let's wrap it up here. I hope you enjoyed that one. And as always, keep the questions keep the questions coming i chill in a couple more minutes here open threads in discord for any questions share your hands refer to the coaching ask me personally there in in the chats not in the direct messages it's always not that i don't like them or or wouldn't answer but it's just i just want to give other people the chance to learn by reading. So put it in there. All right. Cool. Yeah. And then have a great, I don't know, whatever it is. Freaking February. I hate February. Actually, it's a nice day today. Almost March. Yeah. Looking forward to that spring. We're like minus five degrees all the time. And my son right now wakes up before freaking six o'clock. It's even inside. It's freaking cold. And yeah, it's just no fun. And did you know that freaking two-year-olds walk incredibly slowly? It's so insane. Like we want to walk, like we visited Korai yesterday. and it's so insane like we want to walk like we visited korai yesterday and it's like yeah a metro ride which is fine but you want to walk the entire way like to the metro which is really not that far took us freaking 45 minutes was nice it would have been nice in the sun like looking for buses and trams and and excavators and everything is interesting. But when it's freezing, it really sucks. He has a scooter right now, but this is just it's too cold. It's freaking too cold. 28 years ago. Yes, we get there. All right, no more questions. If not, just post them in discord. For everyone who jumped in late, I think Hannes, Katrin, I didn't see you in the beginning. As always, the coaching will be uploaded pretty quickly and then talk to you soon. See you later. Bye-bye. By the way, oh, not by the way. I thought we replanned. I don't want to say next coaching is in two weeks already, but it's actually in three. They rescheduled me. So see you in the mid of March. Not always the end they rescheduled me so uh see you in the mid of march not always the end mid of march i'll see you guys the latest bye
