### TOPIC: cash postflop probing turn after check check
 All right. So I hope you guys hear me already. It would be great if someone was just writing some kind of okay in the chat. Yes, that sounds good. Thanks. Right. Perfect. So I'm actually getting coffee and then I'm ready to go. So you hear my voice is not the very best. I was drinking tea all day yesterday, but yeah, that just comes from the alcohol and the shouting. I'm not sick or anything. So let's see, 19 people in here, just double checking on the Kahoot. I only see 10 people. I need more of you in the Kahoot and then we'll be ready to go soon. I have a couple of questions as always for the quiz. So make sure just to participate, just thinking yourself before just having me telling more or less some kind of solutions just is way better in my opinion. And then again, for everyone who made it, I'm glad that you are here after all the back and forth planning it for last Thursday. And now actually we were discussing like last second, can I do it Friday morning, short notice or now or whatever. I'm super busy these days and definitely didn't want to skip that one though. So yeah, I put actually a little less preparation in that presentation this time, but I'm pretty sure we'll have a good session anyways. And yeah, it's actually a beautiful topic. I was a little surprised with the three topics I gave you to choose from. I felt like that blind versus blind raising will be the one, but that one actually lost. Yeah. Oh, great. Someone from Australia here. Welcome. So that makes me happy to hear. And now 23 here, Laurent, I guess. Or Lauren, I don't know. I guess it's my first live coaching. We can't speak. That's correct. It's just me talking would be too much, but just, I try to keep an eye on the chat all the time or just like leave breaks for, for having like time for you for questions. You cannot join Kahoot with a pin number. So far we have 21 successful members. So I don't know whether it's like a country problem or whatever. Yeah. I don't know how to, how to solve that. You see everything I have here. Maybe someone knows the problem and can help you out. If not, I will, I will start in a minute or two. Yeah. Probably don't use the copy paste. Just type in the numbers yourself. My foot is doing all right. So shout out to Philip. I guess that's you from the players party or the whole poker code Bratislava festival. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm working on my foot. I had a little injury when I'm actually like six weeks, no sports, but I'm working on it. Yeah. Actually not hungover, but still no voice. So it was like my bachelor's party weekend on like last weekend. So the guys picked me up on, on Friday lunchtime and yeah, we were just like heavily drinking until Sunday morning. my voice somehow struggles but i think i will be doing all right so now still people jumping in so i'll leave it another one or two minutes to give everyone the chance all right so still one more i mean i'm waiting for like 30 seconds of no one joining anymore then i think we're good to go or maybe until the Kahoot starts I can start with the session actually already so you guys chose again as always our topic today is probing turn after check check and yeah we'll actually just like I start off with clearing the spot like using that check like that x x kind of writing is probably not familiar for everyone so just to make sure what we are talking about today it is just about us defending the big blind and the flop gets checked around so in one of the videos or it might even be a community coaching we talked a lot about c betting we talked a lot about defending versus c-bets you have the videos on the platform all that and now it's the first time we're actually having the in position aggressor check back so this is one of the most common spots right button hijack cut off whoever open raises we defend from the big blind we either face a c-bet or we don't and when we don't face a c-bet it is our turn on the turn to then think about our strategy. We decide that frequencies and that sizings so this is what this will be all about pretty much and it's one of the beautiful spots we're like hey we have everything and villain might be a little cap to something already so it's it's a good spot to to be in pretty much. Just to clear the term again, because lots of people are mixing that up, I make the difference between probing and delayed c-betting. So it's not that it's a probe every time you are out of position. It's really just when you did defend the big blind, you are not the aggressor. And then you take over the initiative on the turn after the flop went check, check. A delayed c-bet could be the same thing when we open raise from the small blind, big blind calls, it goes check, check while we are the aggressor on the flop. And then we think about delayed c-betting on the turn. So just to make sure that you know exactly what I'm meaning here. And yeah, this is the spot we're talking about today. And yes, spot explanation. And now I guess 25 people, that looks good. Let's start the Kahoot. As always, so for all the first timers, all of my coaching started with a little brainstorm. I want to see what you guys are thinking about and just to have some input to maybe focus on a couple of things I might not even have prepared and yeah why is that German actually but okay what do you think about that spot like just not do you like it or not but like what do you actually think about in game just like type anything right you think about some kind of ranges you think about another advantage you think about villain is weak you might have reads you might have like anything right or when you think about how to, you think about villain is weak, you might have reads, you might have like anything, right? Or when you think about how to work on that spot, do you maybe, I don't know, I don't want to give all the answers. So it's just, I want to get input from you that I hopefully answer most of the questions that might come up throughout this coaching. And you leave that coaching with just knowing, well, I'm a little, little, little smarter than before in that specific spot. So take your time with plenty of that and just give me some answers or some questions or some, whatever, just anything that is in your mind helps. All right. I think, or you can still keep typing answers coming in until i click let's go well i guess they are even coming in after so let's let's have a look okay so we have capness of in position player right very very often this is something we want to make use of if board hits villains range i feel like this is trapping very good point right it's like okay if he hits those range let's say the board is like king king deuce right if it favors my range i feel like he's pot controlling i should attack this spot so you're splitting up the board types already we will talk about that for sure villains weak on low boards again one type of. How he c-bets and how often and how he checks back so I know when to probe often and what size. Polarized when he checks. Very little merged probe betting when he checks often. Okay, right? We will split that up. Again, you see right away with just reading that answer, it's just lots of freaking stuff and everything is different. So it's like if, if, if, if, and we are trying to split that up in a way that makes sense. Check back flop by villain already a tell. In a range bet spot, right? Again, having the different kind of spots. Maybe tilted, I guess not tilted, but what is the word? Whatever. Towards medium showdown hand. I know what you mean. Why does villain check back? Well, that's a great question. Maybe it's a bad board for him. Maybe he's tra maybe whatever range advantage not advantage nuts over time all right the blank out i love it so board distribution player tendencies we're talking about exploitative stuff right reads player tendencies definitely we theoretically are in the game too that we are supposed to be in all right right very good should villain check back often here or not what does it mean does he have weak showdown i can attack okay very good thing maybe he's just trying to get to showdown with a mid-peer or something do i want to attack that how does his range look like their position or equity versus the range on this board texture no one is no one is talking about the turn card so far but okay like The thing that is most interesting for me is usually the turn card. But yeah, frequency size and what the villain changes back with. So we're all mainly on that level, okay, what is actually villain's check back range? And then we talk about different board types and should have an idea how does it look like there. Obviously, one of our examples will be 6-5-3. A check back range on that board looks different than a check back range on one of the other examples. Just got to look at the second screen, which will be ace-king-4. So yeah, if it hits my range, he could also check very strong hands. But if he checks a good board for him, it's very trappy. So you're saying like, he's either very strong or very strong. I i know what you mean but it's it's really that right it's like i'm not saying necessarily trappy but it's like more more defined check back range right when he can range bet but he decides to check back it usually means something when on a board where we have a clear advantage it could still be everything maybe it's just a bad board for him and he gives up in a way or he just like slow plays a hand like pocket aces right how good was the flop for me which player gets help from the turn card here we have the turn card who has more nuts how frequent do i pro all right so i mean i was pretty much summarizing things up on the go a little we have the different board types, and obviously how ranges play on those different board types, and then get to like different strategies, different bet sizings, bet frequencies, et cetera, et cetera. So great input for now. And let's see how to continue here. I think now it's a little overview, just how I want to go through that session. So we will actually start with those board types because I'm loving it, right? If a problem is too big and it feels too big for me right now to talk about all the boards at the same time, I like to split it up. So now we need to find a smart way to divide those board types to then finally conquer them and master them to say like, hey, this board type, I do this and that board type, I'm mainly doing that. After we've done that, we will take a look at like that size, mainly bed sizings, because frequencies kind of go along with them. And we decide, okay, on which boards, what does make sense? We then have a look at a couple of examples. I mentioned two out of the three already, where we have a look at those different boards. What is our plan? What do we actually try to achieve? And then talking about plans, the next step is planning ahead. What are actually our goals in the whole head? We are not just talking about the turn. Do we already try to get the stack in on the turn, having a river plan? Do we try to just like put some needles, some pain on villain for his weak stuff and we like block bad and block bad again and have certain plans? What are we aiming at? What do we try to fold something out over multiple streets? Do we try to challenge some kind of medium strength hands? Or do we try to get the maximum money with our nuts versus his second nuts, right? So this is part of planning ahead. And then actually the second part of examples, I didn't get to prepare because I didn't find good hands in a couple of minutes. So I guess that's still in the slide, but it won't actually happen. So there will be a little summary. And now I'll start with the next question to guide you a little towards my idea of the divide and conquer of the different board types. And the next question will be, you have a minute time and just try to give your best. It will be ranking boards from high to low. And it is about the focus we should put on them. What do you think if I'm making a learning plan now, and this 30 seconds is pretty short actually, if I make a learning plan, what should I focus most on? Just try to do it quickly. What is the most important board that we should work on? What is the least important one? 30 seconds are not much. So whatever that means, red, green, and I still don't know why that isn't German, but I think that is still pretty clear. And I don't know what that actually means here I think that was a little too fast but don't worry so I guess the red means that you mainly typed on the ace five three uh you clicked on that and three five six is the second most and then queen five six and ten ten deuce probably so let's start with the obvious ones right the ten ten deuce from pretty much position. I didn't even say whether we are playing versus the button or the cutoff or the hijack is a range bet. So how in the world should we ever look at that board when we are talking about the probing spot? It doesn't make any sense, right? That spot is just never coming up. So we shouldn't put any effort into it right then probably second lowest would be something like queen nine deuce queen 10 deuce where it's like a range that maybe just 90 betting frequency it's just that spot won't come up queen five six like one of those kind of i call them trade-off boards where it's like 50 to 60 c bad and like and like 40 to 50 percent check in theory for villain it's like yeah we get in that spot quite often so it gets more and more interesting and then we're looking at like two boards that are actually very very very good for out of position right so everyone who ranks the red one like infection is writing here is probably playing shorter stacks right in tournament ace five three is like almost a range bet but with us deep stack cash game players just that straight connectivity with the deuce the four three and five out there is just very very good for the big blind when it comes to nuts so this is actually a board that in position cannot see that very often so that is one where we will get very very often in that spot unfortunately we won't do too much on the turn either like anyways because it's just the ace kind of locks up the situation a little when it comes to denying equity or whatever so there's not too much betting happening on that board so it's actually not too interesting work on it. I mean, it's very interesting because it comes up off in the spot, but not as interesting as the 3-5-6. The 3-5-6 is our board. In position should mainly check back if we don't decide to donk in the first place. But I'll leave that off the plate for now. And then it will be lots of betting by us. Like whatever turn cards we're having're having like even a king which king ace should be the best cards for villain it will still be a lot of betting probably and any low card we will go really really crazy so this is something that we should be prepared for so just first idea okay it is way more interesting to work on those spots that come up often than those spots that never come up. All right. Now, you know how it works. It's another one of those puzzles, different question. I hope I thought I made it a 60 seconds time. Maybe it worked out this time. So take your time on the next one. So let's see. Which boards should we focus on getting reads on villain's check back range? This time we have 60 seconds. So take your time. Where is it most important to have reads on villain's check back range? Again, rank from high to low. So if you think on that board, it's most important, rank that one the highest when you think like reads are really, really helpful here. And this is just about reads on Willem's check back range, which hands are in there. It's not about how does he play the turn or rubber? That's always interesting. All right. So you kind of went with the same boards again. and I think it's exactly the other way around yeah in my opinion oh red is yeah red is wrong oh this oh now i got it 23 okay but still then everyone is wrong i mean okay there's i thought there's more like so thanks for that i thought there's more about like that you can be partly right. But okay, so I'm just explaining what I think. For me, the very clear winner here in a way is KK3. Because, well, villain shouldn't check back. If he does check back, it will be just a certain hand, right? If someone checks back that year on a high stakes table against me, like I mainly put him on ac aces so it's just like that one hand that kind of wants to check back maybe some good ace highs as well but it's just never freaking air like why in this world should he ever check back six seven like not happening so the smaller his check back range the more interesting is to know his exact hand obviously so actually So actually this is just, it's different boards, but it's the reverse order from the one before. Queen 9-4 will be almost a range bet from any position. So if someone is checking back and I have an idea that he is doing that with exactly pocket jacks, pocket tens, and 8-9, this is a big win for me. on jack six five well it's like one of those trade-off boards whatever that means and three five six rainbow is like i mean he's checking checking back 80 percent whatever read how can i have a good read like yes he's checking back aces here or not how much does it change like not too much yes he will be checking back queen jack off here does it help me? No. So a read on a low frequency thing is way, way, way more interesting for me than a read on a high frequency thing. And now that brings us to my personal answer for the divide and conquer problem. And I will just split that up by see that frequency on the flop. How often do I get into that spot? I guess that's pretty obvious in a way, but still. And so I'm dividing those spots by flop strategy. The most interesting for me is when villain has a low seabed frequency or should have that on a board and there will be equity to be denied so villain can have a low c-bet frequency on three five six or he should but the turn is very very interesting for me right i have the straight advantage i have all the peers villain has all the random high cards like if villain comes from from under the gun from hijack he just has all the king jack offs and then the second part is again villain see that's low frequency but the turn will be less interesting for me when it comes to really start like with batting frequencies and stuff because there's no equity to be denied it's like yeah ace king four we have seen that board in a couple of examples it's like 50 50 but it has a very clear defined check back range but i won't attack that board too much because actually it's a huge advantage for in position ace 5 4 i have the nut advantage as the big blind but it's not like i'm trying to move him off like all kinds of random broadways like on 3 5 6 i don't care too much it's like a little locked up in that sense with that ace. So I rank those sports here a little higher, low connected, low peered, where I have not advantage, not advantage over time, and a reason to put bets out there to deny equity from over cards. Then medium c-bet frequency, those, I call them trade-off boards already, right? That's everything where like one high card is there and something connected that helps me that's like pretty much the turn is a big decider will it be a second high card helping villain or is it a third low card giving me not advantage in all kinds of beautiful stuff so i mean a three on the turn on both of those boards would make me very happy if i'm sitting in the big black and then the boards that are least interesting for me and this is why I'm not even having an example of those sports here because the check check is not happening and if it's happening we learned already we need to freaking write down right if someone checks back here and I see the showdown I write this hand down for sure right is it obvious pocket queens or pocket nines? Is someone checking back six, seven ever here? These are the reads because if we get into that spot, then we can decide that we're actually not playing versus a range, but just against a couple of hands. And when we know those hands, we can just fuck them up up and that's a great thing okay let's let me just double check what was planned next okay yeah one more thing for i guess now the next slide is about range visualization we did that before in one of the presentations as well and this is why i gave you the pretty much little preparation homework to look the flop video again because i want to explain my fancy paint graphs every time and i know this looks like eye cancer to most of you but i want to go step by step right this is how i visualize ranges right right side is hands that are very very strong where villain would be ready to go all in with middle is like medium strength left side is the weakest stuff that even folds to a minbed if it's on the very left side. And I just describe what I see here. If we had lots of first timers here, I guess not everyone is familiar with those fancy graphs. This just means on the flop, both of us have all kinds of stuff. I mean, I just range check on the flop. So I have everything. I have something nutted on most boards. I have some full shit on every board. I have some medium stuff on all boards. And villain has the same thing. Villain has top set, middle set, bottom set. Villain has an overpair, aces, kings, et cetera. And now what happens next? Next step is that villain checks back. If he isn't, we are not getting into this spot. But what happened? So far, I didn't change anything. So my range is still the same. But villain's range changed. This looks different for every board. But this is just a small representation. Villain might check back some nuts. If villain is checking back aces on ace-king-4, those but mainly he's betting his nuts so he's not having those anymore the main part of villains check back is usually medium strong stuff right it's just like jack five six we check back a mid pair we check back maybe maybe pocket 10s sometimes. Maybe pocket queens on ace, king, four. Maybe whatever. And on some boards, villain is checking back air as well. So like 3, 5, 6, villain is checking back king, queen, king high. I mean, is it air? Is it not? Who knows? But it's just like, there is probably some weak stuff. Next step. What happens next is we see a freaking turn card. And actually, it obviously shifts things in our range. We have new nuts, and the nuts from the flop are probably not nuts anymore. But our structure stays the same. We didn't do anything so far. We have still our full range. We see four cards. We will have nuts. Well, if nuts are not pocket aces or kings, right? So we will mainly have nuts on most boards. We have strong hands with medium strong hands, and we will have very weak hands. That is just the definition of a linear range. We have everything. And this is all now leading up to our goal of finding out which bed sizings make sense, which frequencies. And whenever I have a linear range, we can pretty much choose. If we want to bed very big, we will find hands for that. If I want to put out small beds, I will find hands that fit into that category. So that just is my explanation for we can do whatever we want in theory right but then it's our turn to look at villains wrench and that is really well we want to we want to hurt him and there it's mainly about the turn card does the turn card give him new nuts is he protected now does the turn card do not help him at all and he's just full of shit all the time well that would be great right is it like something in between and then which parts do i want to attack that's the main thing we should think about on the turn when we get to well sizings right three five six is the turn a seven or an or is it a freaking king what's the big difference it's mainly of which hands is villain improving to how many strong medium hands does he add if he hits like a medium top pair how many nuts does he add pocket kings maybe maybe a two pair how much air does he still have well king queen is not air anymore. It's a top pair now. So actually it's not only he improves to some top pairs, but at the same time, he reduces his amount of shit. So it's all this kind of thought process where you should see, okay, the turn card is a big game changer. All right. So I guess before now talking about how I split it up, getting to bet sizes, we will get to another puzzle. And this time I will ask you for turn strategy. So don't worry. It will be four cards on the board now. It's a flop that went check, check, and I added a turn card. It's all about rainbow to keep it simple, right? So it's not even the R for rainbow or the spades or whatever. So I don't know what the time is. This is why I lead up a little to it. And it's, again, I think you need to rank from highest to lowest betting frequency. Not sure. I'll double read the question, but I think that's it. On which board do we have the highest betting frequency? Not sure. I'll double read the question, but I think that's it. On which board do we have the highest betting frequency? So let's now check, check on the flop and our turn on the turn. Highest betting frequency. Oh, it's not ranking. It's just one answer. That makes it easier or is it ranking i don't know here we go okay pretty easy three five six eight villain does not add any good hands he still has all his trash which is random over cards we have nuts we have peers we have everything so the next one will be a puzzle again and yeah we got one more here and let's see i think it's's a puzzle again. So this might actually be the last question already, because then we will dive a little deeper into, into PIO and let's see. Yeah, it's a puzzle. So how many overbets should we use? Again, highest frequency of overbets to lowest frequency of overbets. So the last one was just about frequency. Now we're talking about the bet sizing where do we over bet a lot we have the six five three board two times here one time with an eight as the turn card another time with the king on the turn we have the queen five six we talked about already and yeah then the the turn three which seems to be very good the ace king four with the queen turn i'm not sure whether that is so beautiful for us So yeah, then the turn three, which seems to be very good. The ace king four with the queen turn. I'm not sure whether that is so beautiful for us. So yeah, interested in that one. Okay, this is what I actually expected. So yeah, we'll find that out. All right, guys. So this is really the thing that I guess most of you clicked on the 6538 again, because we have all the nuts in the world. And let's start with the easiest part, right? Ace, king, four, queen. Well, that's kind of fucked up, right? The queen villain checks back all pocket queens, probably all king queen. He might check back some jack tens even. We are not really good on that board. So why should we overbet in the first place? Why should we use that at high frequency? And then, yeah, that's pretty obvious. The queen 563 is actually the winner. It's like check, check. And we will have multiple bet sizes on this one because we have multiple goals but one clear thing is maybe you remember that board from our check raising list check raising and turn continuation that was the best card in the deck for us where we went with the two e sizing going directional and making that clear on the turn and i can tell you what we're doing exactly the same thing after check, check here. That's like a 20% overbet frequency, but the 2.5 times overbet going directional in, right? The really fuck you in your face. You have pocket kings as the best hand. I mean, not after checking back probably, but like you have queen 10 and that's it. You don't have deuce four. You don't have seven four. You don't have five three. You don't have six three. You don't have all the draws that I'm having. So let's go. I missed the early stage. Is here a big blind versus early position? It's big blind versus anything. On those boards, it does not really matter. So it could be button. It could be early position. It could be anything. This works for all of them. And yeah, now the very interesting part is six, five, three king actually has overbets because, well, the only option that we will use on the 6-5-3-8 board, or like the main option, will be the small bet. That's what the majority of my range wants to do. And that, that my peers want to bet small, gives villain the incentive to raise, which, well, makes it unnecessary for my nuts to overbet, right? If villain checks back kings on that board, he should race against the small bet. Pocket nines, same thing. Ace-eight, same thing. So when I have the freaking super nuts here, it's mainly a small bet to then re-race against villain's race. But getting to the first exploitative thing is if villain is not raising here, you guys are totally right, right? Then we are just putting the money in ourselves. But here, because villain adds so many kings and at the same time reduces his amount of air, the small bet is not that interesting anymore, right? So we just go big right away and we challenge villain's king right away with our nut advantage. So that's like the short explanation. We'll have a deeper look into that. All right. So it feels great to get a hundred percent of you. Perfect. Okay. Let's see. Pet sizings and frequencies. So I just talked in general with the examples there a little, and now it's just about, okay, I give you a little guideline on how it does that work. We always want to know what we're actually targeting. What is our goal? And I would like to keep that open on the side, actually. Let's see. We can just go through the boards. We want to attack or when we want to attack villains' weakest hands, then we use a small sizing. queen six three yeah help help me out with the kahoot questions because i cannot answer them but yeah so the the queen five six three villain did check back ace jack villain did check back ace ten villain did check back some king jack or at least he should do so and that means he has plenty of those hands maybe ace eight offsuit, maybe king-nine offsuit, whatever, right? So it makes a lot of sense to put a small sizing out there because those hands have equity against lots of our hands. If villain has king-nine, he still has six outs against something like pocket sevens, right? If villain has ace-jack, same thing. So this is just something where a small bet makes sense. Then next step, we want to attack villain's medium strong hands, but villain is protected. This is when we use our normal sizing, whether that is 70%, 66%, or 75%, or even 80%, who cares? This is just some kind of normal sizing this is where we like on the one hand we want to attack villains medium part but on the other hand we cannot go crazy because villain is protected that would make sense for ace king for queen when we have ace jack ace 10 we want to get two streets of value but we cannot start over betting like crazy or our two pairs because villain probably has all combinations of pocket queens villain might have like king queen all the time queen four suited even jack 10 sometimes draws that will hit the river so it's like here we cannot over bet probably who knows and this is where that makes sense and then when we want to attack villains medium strong hands but villain is capped this is where we want to put maximum pressure on and on shouldn't villain range bet on ace king four no he shouldn't if he is like the sol like the solver says clear, no, he wants to use big bets. And yeah, maybe write it down for you. This is one of the examples, or maybe it's ace king six. It doesn't matter too much in the, in the flock video on the platform. One of the examples where I explained that why a small bet is not really great. Are these value bets for us? Am I correct? We are talking about value bets, first of all, but we will add bluffs to those ranges, obviously, as well. So it's first, which bet sizes do we want to use? And there, we are not even thinking about value or not. It's the only thought process is, how do I hurt villain? How can I hurt him? What can I attack? So now, you want to attack villains medium strong hands but villainous cap and i wrote down i didn't write down a sizing here on purpose i want to put max pressure on villain and this can be multiple ways this can be an overbet this can be a very large overbet directional in this can be a small bet to then re-race against the race or that can be a check race right so here like lots of those things go hand in hand we're like queen five six three we are the one having the huge advantage here we will see let's freaking go crazy right and and just over bet mainly because villain shouldn't be betting too much. So, well, why should we check race then? It's our turn to keep the control of the pot. 653 king is a little different. Villain adds lots of good top pairs now. So he has incentive to be betting. So we can either overbet and make villain's indifferent right away or we can check race wait for his king to bet and then make it indifferent when we have something like i don't know there are actually more more quizzes coming so i don't want to want to take away the answers six five three eight what is the main part that we want to attack in villains range whether he's cut off hijack under the gun or even but doesn't matter he has queen 10 offsuit queen jack offsuit king 10 offsuit king jack offsuit king queen offsuit he might have aces kings queens as well so then it's like the main thing is we want to attack his over cards we can bet any freaking pair pretty much right because villains over cards have six outs against that. I want to protect against that. The small sizing is enough. And because we are betting with so many weak one pairs, Villain has a huge incentive to raise. Which, exploitative side, lots of people are not doing. But we are always starting with what would be correct. So because Villain is incentivized to to raise quite a lot there it doesn't make sense for us to overbet our nuts this would be just a range split i like to keep my range together if i'm block betting a five i want to block bet my pocket fives the same way to then re-raise same thing for like if i'm betting seven eight 7, 8 for value, obviously, right? Or like for protection, then I want to play my 7, 9 the same way. And this is by just what the other part of our range is giving villain. Which incentives is that giving to villain? And this is what I want to use, that everything works together for me. On 6-5-3 king here, I'm not incentivized to use lots of small betting because it's just easy. Villain is sitting there with a freaking king and not much air anymore. And yeah, so it's like he just calls or yeah. And it's just like not having the same problem like on that card. On ace-king for a queen, a small bet doesn't make any sense really why should i why should i bet small here to to fold on pocket fives yes okay great but is that a success that is no no equity denied like that is something i can just do on the river with a normal bet check check and then do i want to use like over bets with my value no like if i have jack 10 i can bet normal and villain has to raise his queens and then i can still go over top so really what am i what am i aiming at and how do i get that where do i get a job done that really helps me okay so actually that brings us to the first example maybe let's think about that always do i want to have a small sizing the answer is yes when villain has a large part that hates to see a small sizing and that large part has equity against a big part of our range then a small sizing is what we want to have and then it's about how do we attack villains medium strong hats it's's either a normal sizing or the max pressure one, which can be multiple things as well. And that depends on whether the villain is protected or capped. So now let's get to the example. And let's start with a beautiful queen 5-6. This is the one that here in that example, big blind versus under the gun. Exactly the same one that I used for the check raise and continuation, where we have seen that villain should only c-bet with a small sizing, and we play a very, very high check raise frequency. But this time villain decides to check back. We can visualize that range. He checks back lots of Ace-King, Ace-Jack, Ace-Ten. Okay, King-Queen, strong hands like that. Eights, nines tens jacks so it's a very very clear cut when it comes to turn cards how good is a king for him well obviously great right he has way less air now has top pairs, but how good is the freaking three for him? So I'll make one example. It goes check, check. And now let's have a look at that three of hearts. There was one part of the puzzle and that was the one with the highest overbet frequency. And my prediction here is that the small bet makes sense because we are attacking villains ace, jack and ace, king else and the very very large bet makes sense to attack villains king queen queen jack pocket tennis and this is what we see here we are going freaking crazy so we have you see it's this is like zoom 500 sizes that are used here and that is 28 in the pot this year is for everyone who attended the last coaching or seen some of the videos this is the so-called 2e sizing which means going directional in in a linear way same bed sizing on both streets over two streets so this is like two points five x two point whatever x hot and that will be the same bet size on the river. This is just saying, you freaking idiot, you don't have, where is it? You don't have fives. You don't have sixes. You don't have those straight draws. Interesting is that, for example, the 7-4 can be an overbet, can be a block bet. Makes both sense. If we just like to use the lookalike principle again, pocket sevens are a nice blockbet. Seven six is a nice blockbet. Seven five is a nice blockbet. That just fits together. And yeah, all those trade draws. So that's, we have on the one side, make use of the nut advantage because villain is freaking capped. On the other side, attacking villains, weak stuff. So I guess I've no one of you has ever bet like king queen as a block bet here but this is just it just makes a hell of a lot of sense if villains are somewhat correctly checking back this is in the end a reaction to villains check back range and this is again something where unexperienced players use this year as a big size this is 75 maybe some cooler players use 150 because they understand over betting makes sense but why in the world are we not playing for all of it when villain cannot have it right if you tell me okay he's always folding then just go ahead and bluff bluff it off every single time right so that's just like the logic result of the range distribution here. We can have a look at that as well. Well, out of position just has like top, what is that? Top 15%. Totally beat villains top 15%. Top villains best hands are like ace queen and king queen. And some maybe turns or like check back low frequency sets then not really a thing so this is what we want to make use of all right so that should hopefully explain it it's always appreciated throwing in some comments if if you have some yeah sure and yeah so that's the first plan on a three so now let's have a look at the freaking king what's the equity shown in the graph after going check check that is the equity of like the certain range parts that is like we would need to dive a little deeper but it's like here i compare it always like top 10 versus top 10 Thank you. that is the equity of like the certain range parts. That is like, we would need to dive a little deeper, but it's like here, I compare it always like top 10 versus top 10. Green is clearly winning, right? Top 20 versus top 20. Green is clearly winning. So green is out of position, clearly wants to play like for stacks that it's like for playing for stacks means nothing else but playing top five or top 10% top 10 and here red has a big problem if i use normal bet sizes like this year let's say we bet 70 and then 70 again well then we are in that area here where actually we don't have an advantage that is just giving giving up something if we suspect villain to not check back enough medium top pairs, will we first increase our overbet frequency or our small bet frequency? Good question. I think just both. Because, yeah, just both. What does it mean? Is he relatively, then he's just having more air. I mean, he's forced to be over-folding against any bet size. So it will lead to me being very bluff heavy, I guess, at some point, because just villain is missing the hands that are actual bluff catchers. And that means I'm just increasing frequencies all over the place. All right. Now, keep that in mind. We have that clear goal of going directional in or betting small for that reason we are protected with a small bet with some nuts i like using the lookalike principle for that and then right we have something if villain raises now small bet he raises aces whatever, then again, we have huge leverage to again, fuck him up. So, uh, right we have something if villain raises now small bet he raises aces whatever then again we have huge leverage to again fuck him up so uh that's that's the whole plan now let's have a look at another turn card as we have seen in the range visualization it's pretty much a lot about how does villain hit the turn card how much new nuts does it give him how much more incentives to bet now let's have a look at, I guess, the worst card in the deck for us. It's like either the king or the jack of hearts. So let's take the jack of hearts here. And what do we see here? We start again. Does the small bet make sense to attack villain's weak part? Yeah, I mean, in a way we attack pocket eights maybe, but that about it so it's like does not really make sense the bigger bet yes would make sense villain is protected we want to bet something but it's just like it's just not our card right it's just villain we don't have any nuts we have some good queen eggs sure we have some two pairs but where's our advantage and that is the very yeah polarized turn card game here we're like i see the flop i just hope for like a nine or lower then i can go crazy if it's a 10 or higher i'm pretty much fucked up right it's not only the nuts that villain added here like all the pocket jacks in the world having queen jack it's as well the nuts that he will make on the river ace king ace 10 all that stuff so here okay we are pretty much close to a range check and yeah which is like then it's not really talking about sizings we see here this is a solve for okay 20 percent of betting ace queen if i keep the solve running a little longer this is probably disappearing or is getting less and less so this is how sick it can get and i'll let me get i guess i have one more question here regarding that board and now we'll get a different turn card let me see i'm not 100 sure different turn card on that board and we have a we have a hand we have queen 10 on queen 5 6 and turn is a 5. Which lines after what we have discussed now are you actually thinking about? Very fast, guys. Very fast, guys. All right. So we have all kinds of options and the five is now we've seen, okay, on the three, we had an overbet or block bet. On the king, we had pretty much a range check and then, some leftovers of a small bet. Here it's like, yeah, on the five, it's a little like a three, just not giving us so many nuts. We have nut equity with with the straight draws plus we have way more 5x so we will definitely see an overbet here the queen 10 will definitely not qualify for that but there's no reason at all to implement a normal betting range villain is saying thank you yes this is exactly right up my alley it's like i have queen jack i checked that king queen uh i have pocket knives that's all cool for me so well the only thing we can do is just block betting here to attack villains king jack ace jack whatever and then that is a value hand that fits in there let's just double check on that we'll get the five hearts and we see pretty much what i explained like we can have those small block bets we can leave them like if this is just we can simplify and just play overbet or check that works as well you see like there's no hand that clearly wants to put that block bet out there with clearly i mean more than 50 percent the overbet is the important one again and again we are like going really really crazy like it's not we are putting 120% out there. This is 400 BB stacks, that two E sizing, going crazy pretty much. All right, so Queen 10 was okay. Betting small is fine. Checking is fine. All right, let's get to the next, not the next example, because actually I wrote something down regarding that board here. board here. So just a summary of that example, the plan on a turn king, there is no weak part for us to attack because villain just improved. Villain is freaking protected again. We have no nuts. So there's just not much interest in betting. The plan on the three was, we want to deny equity of over cards. So something like pocket seven, six, seven is very incentivized to keep betting. But for that, we just need a small bet. And we want to make use of our nut advantage. While villain has no incentive to bet a lot himself. If that was the case, check raising can be cool as well. So make use of your nut advantage. And here it means clearly over betting. So often it just means make use of nut advantage does not mean overbet necessarily. It means we want to play for the maximum money. If villain has a high betting frequency because of the turn card himself, that can be a check race. If he has a high raising frequency because our range gives him incentive to do so, then it can be a block bet re-race. And this is what we need to think about. Often when I coach students, it's just about, hey, I have nuts here. He can't have it. I overbet. But you need to implement that in your overall range. Or if you know something about villain, he is doing stuff wrong. Well, then you obviously exploit. If someone is delayed betting way too often, I always go for the check raise obviously take the free money if someone is just never raising hell no i will never block bet to re-raise i just put it in myself right so this is where we think on the on the exploitative side and the goal of our nut advantage is just put the get the maximum money in the middle all right next example is the ace king four so maybe we had the question before that one yes we had the question before what that that is not a range bet for a villain and this is the sim that was in one of the c-bet flop videos we're like yes we could range but we have a huge advantage but actually we want to mainly use a big sizing to charge villains offsuit broadways before our advantage is gone and a 5 4 3 deuce queen jack 10 gives villain new straights and yeah so i want to charge him for not having anything right now that means i use a big sizing and that means at the same time i don't want to use a big sizing with king queen. So this just ends up in a checking range, maybe being a little protected with pocket aces or something. But yeah, I will turn nuts myself on any cards, turn new nuts. So it's not important to have too many nuts in your check back range here. But we see a very, very clear check back range. Lots of king X, the pockets in between, some of that full shit that just tries to bluff later so this is a board that actually gets now just a question haven't we are a difference here versus early position or late position range sure there's a difference it just depends on how many nuts does villain add so i like the queen five six three because it's very similar. Button and early position both shouldn't have seven four and four suited, and five three and six three suited. So nuts wise it's not a big difference here. But obviously if it's like six eight nine, this can be great against under the gun when like your ten seven and five seven makes a straight, but button does have that himself. So versus the Button, it will not be that black and white and more trade-offs where you will see more mixes and everything is fine, but just you won't need to find that logic. So for examples, I always love having big blind versus under the gun because it just shows it very, very clearly what the incentives are. Like the queen 5-6, it it's freaking overbet directional in nothing else or the block bet, but like betting 75% is just waste. So yeah, this shows it pretty clearly when villain is more and more protected. Like we will see that in that example here, we will have more trade-offs where it's more normal sizings, more mixes of stuff, but this is always bad to explain incentives. So yeah, I hope that answers that question. And yeah, now we have that very, very clear check back range. And I hope you have an image in your head right now of that King X, of like weak Ace X, of those peers, of that ear, where now, all right, let's have a look at a turn card after check, check, which is let's say a five of hearts. So what does that mean? Okay we improve to out of position. We have nuts which is pocket fives pocket fours. We have five four ace five ace four. We have king five king four. We have some deuce three suited and we have some nut draws regarding the straights. So a pretty clear prediction here is we will have overbets. We want to attack villains a7. We want to attack villains queens, villains king-x, villains whatever. And villain on that five doesn't really add lots of new nuts. So that's an okay card for us. And then again the next question, do we want to have a block bet, a small bet here? And this is, remember the slide of the divide and conquer? It was mainly about, are we denying equity of something? I don't like low boards. We want to put those small bets out there. Here, we will see some just because the solver works like that. To fold out jack nine, 10-9, but I don't care about that at all. Like whether I fold 10-9 out now or not, i don't care it's like that that is waste right so i don't need to fold it out like let him play his ten nine so my prediction is that we are mainly playing over bet or check and uh i hope this is what we are seeing here all right it's like i didn't let the solver run forever this is why you see those two 2%, 4%, 4% here. We're clearly seeing though that it's not the two E sizing for example, it's not we're going directional in because villain is a little protected, can have ace five, can have pocket aces, can have four or five himself and we are not having like all the nuts in the world. We are more playing like ace jack, ace ten and that's it. Then we have our two pairs, then we have our straights and straight draws and actually it's straight we don't have it too often and we have the sets obviously so here again we have just low frequency betting but big sizing i see lots of people just like block betting their ace 80 or twice it's nothing else but checking again and then putting one big bet out there but with with a block bet now, you just weaken your checking range. It doesn't make any sense. So that is a pretty clear thing where we see the small bets disappear because the small bet doesn't have an effect on denying equity. It's like folding out something that is garbage anyways. That is not a big success. So that is a pretty easy here and i guess let's let's do the quiz now before showing uh the result with the next card we'll have a hand again on another turn card on that exact board all right so again not much time so try to visualize the board ace king four the turn card will be a queen and we have the freaking super nuts same question again which lines are you thinking about all right so i probably tricked you in that one as well after looking in the last one. So we can obviously discount everything with a block bet. That's the same thing. We have no interest in block betting. We are not denying any equity. Whether I fold out his sevens now or not, I don't care. That's it. So it's pretty much, are we always betting would be the green option. Or we checking and and betting and mix it up like that and then it's the question what is the bet size and this was in one of the first slide like the first slide about bet sizing was today if villain is protected we won't use an overbet and this is just the thing villain will have pocket queens villain can't even have some jack 10 villain have all has all the king queens so obviously i can take my jack 10 now and just overbet it all the way because i have more of that but it doesn't fit to the rest of my ranges and so actually the only thing i'm using on a queen here is the normal bet because villain is protected i do that with all the hands that i want to be betting or the check because I'm checking my king jack, my queen 10, all that to then go crazy when villain bets. So let's just double check on that. Let's take that queen. Well, we clearly see here, okay, block bet not really interesting. And I tell you those 6% will almost completely disappear if I keep the solver running it's just like how it works we see all those like little percentages they will disappear and the only option that he likes is normal bet the over bet not a thing because it's not something that hurts villain it just makes life easy for him or checking and then our super nuts they go into those both options actually we only have those two options right we want to check to then later check raise or we want to bet and well villain needs to raise his queens at some point so we should still get it in right so let's have a look what if the river then is a brick he just calls this time the deuce is a freaking sick card okay let's take a break that break. Call. Then we just keep going. The jack-10. It's again a normal bet and can be sure that there will be raises. Villain has his river two pair. Villain has his pocket queens. Villain has his aces. So important is always when we have the super nuts to get it in versus second nuts. And villain should do so. Normal bet, I consider everything between like 60 and 80 percent so um i have the 75 hotkey 66 is fine 80 is fine and 70 is fine like like half pot is a little little less i want to have a clear difference between my block bet which is like between 25 and 30 and my normal bet and i don't want to use way more sizes than that. Yeah, in that spot. All right. So we have seen kind of a brick turn where we add straight draws. We have seen something where villain is protected on the turn. Now let's have a look at something where villain's like really strong. And then we see just at the king, he checks back all the king X. He has all all the nuts in the world now and that makes us end up with a range check. But the same question that I ask myself every freaking time. Small bet, does it make sense? Can I overbet or is he protected? Or maybe it's just, does a small bet make sense? And then if it's just about attacking the medium part, can I use an overbet or is he protected and I need to use a normal kind of bet size? That's all what it is. And then thinking about nuts, how do I split that up in my ranges? How does it fit into the incentives that are given? My goal is not to bet. My goal is to get maximum money in. And that doesn't mean necessarily betting. Okay, let's see a little summary there as well plan on a turn three or six or whatever it was there's no weak part that with equity that we can attack so i'm not interested in a small sizing doesn't have an effect makes it way too easy for villain to react but villain is capped so we use big sizes only which means over bet like he's not like capped capped and can never have something good so it's i'm not using going directional but like the 150 key is pretty nice plan on a turn queen queen again no weak part with equity to attack for villain but here villain is uncapped so that means only a normal sizing The same pattern over and over again. All right. So let's get to, where is the third one? The last example. It's hiding from me. I should have three of them open. Got it. Okay. So this here is now big blind versus button. I force ourselves to do a range check. Donking would be a thing if we want, but not really necessary. But what we see here, villain has a very, very low C-bet frequency. Again, repeating something from before. Here, it's not really interesting for me to get reads on his check back range. It's like seeing one hand doesn't me anything everything should be in there like he should have check back aces pretty much always he should check back like his random broadways it's like a full range how can i have a very clear read on that it's very tough so it goes but therefore the board is very very interesting for me because it goes check check very often and then we have multiple turn cards again that we should think about. Let's take a fancy one first. Let's take the eight of spades. So we have all the six X, five X, three X. We have all the eight X. We are protected with all the nuts and two pairs. And villain mainly has, check out offsuit hands. This is offsuit. This is lots of combos. Ace, queen, king,-queen, king-jack, ace-jack, queen-jack, ace-ten, king-ten. All that offsuit bullshit stays bullshit on that eight. So this is what we will see here. It makes a lot of sense to just keep pushing. So it's here. Small bet makes a lot of sense. Just double check on villain's reaction he hates his life with all that it doesn't look too much but this is all offsuit again this is a hell lot of combinations so we really have pain for villain and now his reaction you should already see what our nuts are interested in villain should be raising more than 20 percent here against our small bet because we are betting small with all kinds of shit right we have all the king nine off suits queen nine off suit jack nine off suits random eight x random six x random five x four x not four x as well but three x etc so we can have the normal bet as well which is a little stronger, like our sixes are in there, like a queen four draws in there, some of the seven axes in there, the good eight axes in there. That's a healthy split. Against the big bet, there's not that much raising. So mainly our super nuts will be in the, I mean, it's a split, right? I want to say it's in the block bed, but that's actually not true. But it's just a hell of a mix. And this is now where we have to think exploitatively. You guys gave me the answer that you love over batting on that board, which is correct if villains are not raising here. So we need villains to raise here because then this is what's happening with our nuts. We have 15% re-raise against that. I didn't offer enough sizings that would be a way bigger size here going direction all in, but that's, yeah, not the perfect set. But this is important. Our goal here, the only thought process we're having with our nuts is how do I get the maximum money in? Should I check and then check raise because he's betting very often? Is he way more calling than betting? Well, then I should overbet myself. Or is he a good player who understands that I'm betting small with all kinds of shit and therefore raises with both value, which I will get value from when I'm re-raising and bluffs as well, right? Triggering with a small bet and bluff is just extra money in my pocket. And this is the very, very important thought process. And it makes it easy for you as well. If you don't split, like you want to bet your queen six year, most of the time, you want to bet your queen eight all the time. And you want to have that protected as well. And it's not like you're betting small. You small you don't have it lots of people are over betting their seven four here and their fives and their sixes and always betting small with their other shit and then i'm well i can go crazy against that raise my pocket jacks and get infinite value against an unprotected range so this is what we see here when the turn is a low card have good reason to attack villain's weakest part. So we use the small bet. Villain is not really protected. So we are allowed to do anything and we should put maximum pressure on that. That can be an overbet. The solver tells us no, if villain is playing correctly, but this is just experience or we all know it. I don face 21.5 raises there against my small bets so maybe we should take here a little more of the pot ourselves and have that over bet with some nuts especially on lower stakes all right let's check out a very different card let's take the king of diamonds what will be different here villain will have way will have way less air. Not king queen, not king jack, not king ten, because that is all top pair now. He has a way bigger incentive to be betting himself. So I'm checking my 6x, 5x, 3x maybe, so he wants to value bet against that. That king really takes away the small bet for me. In two ways makes less sense. Villain has less air that I can attack and villain has more better hands that I need to be protected against in a way. So I think that brings us to the next quiz question there. Where's the Kahoot? Let's go. So board is 6-5-3. I'm not sure the turn will be a high card i'm not 100 sure whether it's the king but be prepared for a high card again think about which lines we are taking with a certain strong hand let's see not much time we have pocket fives on exactly that board with an offsuit king on the turn which lines do we think about Thank you. Let's see, not much time. We have pocket fives on exactly that board with an offsuit king on the turn. Which lines do we think about? I think I discounted one of them already. Or even two. Give me the green, guys. Okay, so I pretty much discounted the small bet still five of you were clicking on it so it's that yeah the small bet just is not something that is interesting for me here because my six x three x they mainly want to check they are not incentivized to bet small and therefore villain has way less incentive to race against the small bet it's really the over bet or check i check and he bets his king and i can check race the shit out of him or i bet big myself and he's like hating his life right away so let's double check on that king of diamonds what we see here is still there's some small betting like some of the king x in a way but i see it that way again a sim that did not get solved to like infinite i don't find a single hand that clearly wants to bet small more than 50 of the time so that tells me that that is not really interesting probably goes down a little more what we see here again is the freaking two e sizing really saying i have the straights,s i have the sets you don't and pocket fives for me is like a very very clear over bet or check with the goal of check raising right it's like i can over bet and what you see his turn king is indifferent right away this is this is where we can hurt him or i check he's supposed to bet his stronger kings whatever sizing let's take the bigger one again wrong check raise sizing here and then i'm check raising the shit out of him and uh yeah it's really i need a bigger check rate size here so uh that that kills it a little but yeah you understand you understand the thing we're here really what are our incentives? What are we targeting? We want to make use of our nut advantage. And we were thinking about how can we do that? And we think about how can we, well, which other things do we want to use? And what we see here again, we don't want to use a normal bet. Like normal or slide over bet just makes it super easy for villain. If I bet 42 here percent well villain folds everything and calls a king like how can he ever make a mistake here if i bet same thing if i bet like 75 percent yeah he calls when he has a king or when he hits like the board somehow or as like some nut thing right some some nut equity like okay that's not the toughest thing to do in the world so really the pain is here with a very big bet villain only really loving his pocket kings that's it and the check to then react when he bets his king right we want to be protected because we have so much six x five x etc wouldn't a small bet induce villain to race with king, king? Yes. If he has that one, but against king, king, I should always get the money in the middle. I'm not thinking about just one combination. Obviously, villain is raising his super nuts, but villain shouldn't be inclined to raise like a small king, 10 or something. So, the question, I like this one here because I try to keep it simple because there are way, way, way more options regarding flushes, completing straights, etc. So I try to keep it as simple as possible to just see what do we want to attack? How protected is Villan? These are the main questions. And I have the question here from Sahai Sahaj. I'm not sure. Can you show some examples on flush completing turns and what approach we take? Think about the questions. How many times have you heard that? sahaj i'm not sure can you show some examples on flush completing turns and what approach we take think about the questions how much does a small bet make sense and what is the best way to attack villains medium strong hands how do i get the maximum money in with my nuts just type it in the chat and try to help me out and we'll have a look this is is a great question. We should definitely look at one flush card. Yeah, what changes? If you think about, it's the same thought process, just the flush, right? It's like whether they get straights or sets or two pairs, it's a flush that, well, both players should have it. So what changes? Just type it in for us in the chat. We need some brave people here. I won't make fun of people messing up now. I only do that in the quizzes. So don't worry. Villain should have more nut flushes. I'm not sure. I guess he will bet flush draws on the flop. Right. Small betting on flush completing card. No overbet because he is protected. Overbet or check since most people bet flush draws. Now we are on the exploitative side. We want to start with what would be correct. You can have a look. We have clubs here. This is his betting range. People are betting clubs, but not always on boards like like that villain should check back lots of those clubs so we don't like this would be next level to say we have the reads that people always bet flush draws here let's play like solid poker they should be prepared for both ranges like they should check back flush draws and bet flush draws so they are protected indeed we have more flushes i'm not sure about that we have another advantage i'm not sure about that we have a wider range as well and it's about who has relatively more flushes never use so i read it a couple of times now so normal betting check as by a small size we're not hurting his range and should not use overbet our equity improves versus his range we block but mainly as he has not advanced so we are unsure about the nut advantage but what we should be sure about is that overbets won't be really a thing. So villain is protected. That was one of our rules, so we won't have overbets. There will be probably some overbetting with just some of the blocker, but whatever. Let's get like kind of a neutral card, but flush card. A 10 of clubs. And this is what we are seeing then. Check, check, 10 of clubs. Very important lesson here, no overbetting. First of all, because villain is protected. What does that mean? It's sure we still want to get the money in with our nut flush, but villain does have second nut and third nut flushes and a reason to bluff himself when he does not have it to have a range going with bluffs and value so we don't need to do the job ourselves villain will help us when we have a nut flush here a six of clubs we can do whatever we want ace eight of clubs we can do whatever we want we can bet small villain should raise some of his flushes here. So no need to overbet. He raises and we will get the money in with our nut flushes, second nut flushes. We can re-raise, we can check jam the river, we can do whatever. So it's no need to do the job ourselves. Villain has incentive to put bets out there. So first learning, Villain protected on flush cards. If he checks back some flush draws, that means, well, over bets are out of the equation. And then it's mainly about the second card. So the second, not the second card, about the turn card, not really thinking about the flush too much. If it's the seven of clubs, we will bet mainly small with a very high frequency because there is a very large range we are attacking. Just think about villains offsuit hands without a club, ace jack without a club, king jack without a club, king 10. We want to make use of that, right? Not having a club, all that's not false. This is what we want to make use of, making use of our 4x advantage. It's not another advantage, but we have more 4x. But then we just navigate through the pot with small sizes. Or obviously we can take some normal sizes, but here it's really about the small pierce mainly. If we have the king diamonds and king of clubs yes the flushes protect both sides so overbet won't be a thing but the king again tells us block bet doesn't make sense same thing like the king of diamonds and then well here we cannot use an overbet but the bet we want to use is still like then the normal kind of the trade-off thing so it's it's it's really like that you can treat the flush card like just the card disregarding the flush and the flush just means you need to size down everything because everyone is protected right so if we see it king of diamonds again over bet or small bet or check but mainly overbet then the king of clubs means same thing just the overbet is now way smaller but it's not even overbet anymore if we see the seven of spades all the time small bet and some big betting well the seven of clubs will be small betting and less big betting it's just like everything decreases a little is it also true an ace of clubs when he lacks is well we won't have nut flushes as well when the ace of clubs falls so it's the same thing let's have a look ace of diamonds it's pretty similar to the king it's here over bet small betting, check. Ace of clubs will take away the overbet and well actually takes away the small betting as well. I mean yeah, makes sense because villain has just so many ace-x that the small bet... ah no, I'm not really sure about this why the small bet is totally away. Probably just not interesting enough to fold out some king-10 offsuit. So that is really the pattern. The turn card tells you a lot, and the flush means just villain is protected, so it takes overbet out of the equation. All right. Let's summarize that third example. We had a king. There's just some weak part to attack because villain improved a lot on the king, but villain is capped. It's like maybe there's some small betting, but the main part is go big or go home. Let's really fuck him up. He doesn't have the straights and we make him hate his king on the turn right away. Or we check race. Both totally fine. Then the plan on the turn eight, I only gave you the seven. Let's have a look at the eight, but that should be the same thing. The eight, Villain has all those offsuit broadways and we can just push equity with all our weak peers, protect them. And because Villain should be raising a lot, we should play our nuts the same way. If he is not raising, we need to split ranges and really build the pot ourselves. That's on the exploitative side then. Deny equity of overcards with a small bet. Make use of nut advantage. Choose the line to get the maximum money in, not necessarily the overbet. In theory, the block bet to re-raise is the preferred one. Okay. So I guess with all the talking about that, we talked about that next slide already. I call it planning ahead, right? It's keep your goals in mind, right? It's really, what are you trying to achieve here? Are you denying equity of overcards? Are you using your nut advantage to get the money in the middle? Do you do that by over betting, by check raising, by block betting? That is your chance. Your nuts should cover your weaker part of the range. If your weaker part of the range wants to check, like on 6-5-3 king, your nuts should protect that checking range and then go crazy. if your weaker parts like on six five three eight wants to bet small use your freaking nuts to cover that part of your range and re-raise or do something exploitative if you have reads always go for it right it's about getting maximum money in understand that range visualization i gave you those little graphs we have the linear range villain is lacking nuts or not depends on the turn card and give him a challenge if he does not have nuts try to find the perfect spot to attack his medium strong hands if villain has only random over, challenge those with a small bet. Think about that part when it is about villain's weak part, that it's really about equity. Folding that out is only important when that part has equity. Folding out 9-10 on ace-king-4-5, I don't care about at all. So this is where the small bet disappears. And then this would now go too far to cover all that, but this is maybe something that you can work on next, double-checking some of that or just putting thoughts into it. How to continue on the river, right? I'll just drop a kind of a golden rule here that from a big bet, we will usually go into a huge bet or a big bet. From a block bet, our standard line is to go in the next block bet. It doesn't make sense to block bet the turn and then overbet the river. It's like the block bet is there, is around a range that just wants to deny some equity or gets minimum value. And that gives incentives for villains to race against that. So if we think about overbetting a river, we should rather block bet and then re-race. So this is kind of a line. Maybe showing one more example of that, where that works pretty well to just show you again, that example versus under the gun. I'll take my favorite card again on the the three we have seen we overbet or we block bet or we check let's overbet and that is the one directional and this is what i mean with planning ahead we are betting a size to go linearly directional and boom villain is indifferent with all kinds of shit river is another good card and the only thing we are doing is um from go big going into huge right this is just we have two pair plus we are all in right so this is just there don't even think about blocking anything like it just like doesn't make any sense you started your story on the turn this is your story that's it and your hands like i have grinded with so many so many uh tournament players they are like yeah but then he's never calling sitting there with the nuts but at the same time bluffing the next time and then complaining about getting called from something ridiculous this is just what makes theoretically sense if you have a read you can adjust but this this should be your baseline. Next thing, three, we have block betting. Something like king-queen, king-jack, willing calls, river is same eight. Here, we're mainly going to block bet some normal betting, or like same-same, or just the value we you want to get but no no overbet right if we think about overbetting something like our river pocket eights that goes in the block bet it saves other hands because villain is incentivized to raise and then we can go over the top for the stack instead of overbetting here and just getting called by king queen right your range needs to fit together that's it right so not i have a strong hand i bet big no i have a strong hand i get the maximum money in and it's your job to find that way okay so this little golden rule should help a little and this is really something you can work on just thinking about those rivers what are you block betting on the turn what's happening next on the river what is your plan what happens on like changing river cards whatever all right before my voice totally goes off we get to the summary okay so remember the first brainstorm we did today you gave me the input different board types different importance of boards that we should look at i gave you a way to divide and conquer that just by just how important is it, how often is villain c-betting on the flop, where is it important to keep your eyes on reads, right? If villain is just checking back some hands, it would be great to know those hands. All right, so divide and conquer, very important when diving deeper into that topic. Every board is different. Then I delivered you my main ideas regarding the batch sizings and the frequencies. And then we obviously looked at examples to back that up with a solver, right? We talked a little about reads and exploits, right? How important is it to have a read and the exploits? Okay, mainly when it comes to nut attempts. We had the one question where it was about if villain is not checking back strong enough, which frequencies do we increase? All of them, right? So it's really that is villain protected? Does it make sense to attack a weak part? What is the perfect way to make use of our nuts that we build a whole nice range that is like kind of invulnerable that it's like okay if villain is crazy in that way we take the money with those hands the villain is crazy in the other way we take the money with those hands and now the last part about planning ahead really have a plan for the river the hand usually shouldn't stop on the turn right it's just that i gave you the example an ace king for something where i see so many yeah i put him on a king so i bet my ace eight now but i'm scared of betting big so i bet small and then i bet small again we're like yeah that's just not a thing that makes sense why should you have that small bet with that i have an ace he has a king just check again and then bet big right that's something that makes sense the small bet does not achieve anything on the turn so just try to really use those those bet sizing ideas to build your turn wardrobes there and and and think about it in a way that makes sense to them well if you get it wrong and you think like yeah you over bet where somewhere you should more check raising, that's both fine. Those things are like, they go hand in hand. And that will often be the case. So this is why I gave you the quiz questions where it's like, which lines should we think about? I always gave two answers because there was never one correct answer. And there are reasons for that. And this is just something where I want to drive you in the little, put you a little in the right direction. And yeah, I guess that's it. So yeah, any last questions? Happy to answer them. Since you're recording, will this session be uploaded to PocoCode? Yes, they are all on there. So they are not in the empty, like some of them are in the MTT session. The usually get put into the the cash game content the existing so all of that will be definitely uploaded yes all right thanks guys and then that's it so probably i won't be making too many videos from like the next two weeks i try to put out out one or two more this week, but then I'll, uh, I'll be off for the wedding. So, um, I hope that's fine for you guys, but, um, again, discuss all those topics in the channels. I'll have a look over it, work together, right. Especially that planning ahead is a great thing where you can just post some hands, right. Regarding that topic, uh, where you learn very, very, very quickly, now having a clear view on the topic, and yeah, that's it, so cool, last question, are you coming to Vegas? I just read the news about Vegas opening, start of November, so I will think about it for just a week, going there for just a week, if that is the case but i wait for the final yeah final news pretty much all right guys uh thanks so much and see you next time or in the videos around bye bye
