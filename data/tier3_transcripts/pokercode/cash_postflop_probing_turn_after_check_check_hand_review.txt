### TOPIC: cash postflop probing turn after check check hand review
 Alright guys, so here we are for a little follow-up on our community session that was on probing from the big blind after we had a check check on the flop. I tried to bring you as much as possible of the theory of the sizings and we've learned a couple of things. First of all we need to react to the turn card. How does that interact with villain's range? Does it give him the big advantage now or are we the ones with the linear range having the nut advantage on our side? What about different rivers? How can they change the interaction between the ranges? And then once we figure that out in a broad way we think about which sizings should we use to attack villain. One big thing we thought about a lot was what to do with our nuts. They are pretty much dictating how we play that spot and it's a common mistake to just say like okay I have the nuts I want to bet big because out of position we have more options to build a pot one of that is to bet small to let villain race and then we can re-race to get the maximum in the middle we can check protect our weaker showdown value and then race against villains bet or we can start over betting if we think okay villain is not betting at a very high frequency or we can put a lot of pressure on a big range part of his. Which other sizings do we want to use? How is villain's range constructed that we can attack that in an effective way? Does he have lots of medium showdown value that we want to attack with a big polarized sizing? Does he have random over cards that are pretty much only drawing to top here which might only be the second best hand? Well maybe you want to use a very small sizing. And now I'll just play it a couple of sessions and I want to look at exactly that spot and how I approached it. So we try to bring all things together and make those in-game decisions. Or I show you how I made those in-game decisions. First of all, what I think would be correct in that spot. Then adding what villain is doing wrong as always. And maybe trying to find the right exploit. So here we are trying to play as good as possible in-game. Not necessarily trying to copy the solver. Even though I try to mention what I think would be right in certain spots. All right let's get started with this hand and yeah king jack offsuit we face a 2.5x from middle position from a player who looks like 22 18 pretty raggish stats definitely defend here not three betting really. Close to 0%. So we're just having that hand all the time here. And now we have a board that Villain can easily bet with full range. He from middle position has all the offsuit 10s. Jack-10, Queen-10, King-10, Ace-10 with very high frequency. And he has the over-peers, which is always great when there's pretty much no hit board. Yes do have 10x as well but yeah it's just his board for now and i have lots of shit like that and now we have the first special thing that villain decides to check back we talked in the coaching about that specific thing this is something that is definitely worth to have a read on when villain villain could see that 100 maybe he's just checking back one certain hand maybe he's checking back like five to ten percent and having an idea of that makes a lot of sense or is a great note that we can use later when we get into that spot again so here my general view is people are strong. If someone has five six of hearts he will go for that range bet option. So I expect villain to have something like maybe even pocket nines, maybe something like well maybe ace king ace queen high, maybe something like pocket aces that just do not want to fold out and he wants me to hit a king or or a jack, whatever. So as a result, I'm not really betting that here often. Not with my 10x not with my 9x not with anything else because well against those hands probably a check race i expect to see a very high frequency bet here and then i have to make decisions so i have an easy check fold versus every bigger sizing and And now he tackles me with that 25 percent I have six outs where I'm not sure how good they are and I have three maybe four outs the queen not sure about clubs but I don't think he has too many flush draws in that in that line that is pretty solid so it's a it's a close thing here I think folding is not out of this world given that that greed on population tendency but calling is definitely fine just for the for the odds. But keep in mind rivering a king or a jack and then facing a big bet is probably just a bluff catcher. So I decide to call here and river is the perfect card. I an upsize to 75 percent and go for obviously clear value check raise something like pot or even a little bigger and get called by pocket aces right so yes you can see i already made that note here single raise pot as pre-flop raiser middle position versus big line check back aces on 10-10 deuce this is like what what can help me in the future even when he checks back different boards right it's like villain is checking back in a four bad pot on queen queen five rainbow another range bet it's like very likely that he either has like aces or ace queen or something like that just giving me a little rope to hang myself instead of really going for the range play so here i was lucky to hit that queen and not a king or a jack then made up for that with realizing Thank you. just giving me a little rope to hang myself instead of really going for the range play. So here I was lucky to hit that queen and not a king or a jack, then made up for that with realizing my implights, and I don't know, would I ever be bluffing in that spot, given the thoughts I put into it, trying to move people off aces, or something else strong? Probably not, so I'm very happy with that outcome here. And yeah, I want to still focus on my turn decision after that check check. Let's get to the next one. So we have I think yeah recreational but definitely unknown player here. Three axing on the button, we can sometimes three bad but that would be more of a kind of a bluff. So yeah I'm calling here all day long and villain decides to check back that board another board that is not a range bet but a high frequency c-bet board he connects very well he will connect to that tenant aid will make backdoor straights and stuff he has the equity with all the overcards i didn't hit too much here there's no straight possible right now i obviously have all the draws but maybe another spot where figuring out what he's checking back here might be might might be useful for us right does it include some air like four or five of diamonds is he checking back nines all the time here what about his eight acts I don't know right we have no clue goes check check but that would be my first expectation that he checks back like kind of a correct range with maybe some little flush draws some eight acts and pocket nines some ace x and now i'm turning top two pair on a board that has flushes right so villainous should definitely be protected i have flushes he has flushes and i have the top two pair he could have eight x with a heart he could have pocket nines with a heart he could have ace five of spades so here I play a very low frequency but there's definitely no reason to have like a small sizing at all it doesn't make sense to over bet either because I mean villain is not capped or anything so I like to put out a normal bet and my hand category just fits perfectly in there. So I bet 75% here and villain decides to min-rigs. And now is definitely the point where I just put like the recreational player tag on him. And yeah, I know I'm like, maybe he has some ace queen raising for free showdown. Very good to have notes like that. Or I expect that to be pretty nutted. So I call. I have four outs to the nuts. Maybe he slows down. Obviously, I'm not folding. I get one of the perfect outs. So yeah, no reason to do anything else but checking. And then he goes for that large pot bet. And definitely worth taking note here here as well and let me just copy my template in here as pfr just this is just other right it's just like min race nuts turn and follow up with like pot bet river pretty much right this is just the freaking nut line we all know that from recreational players i obviously go for everything i expect zero percent fold equity a spot i would never ever ever ever bluff so we are on the highly exploitative side here stacking his queen seven of hearts which would be another note that this guy is checking back flush draws right but yeah no need to to write that down now okay now next spot jack seven suited definitely defending here big blind versus cutoff, not even close, versus 2.25x, another wreck we are facing, and we get a board like that. Very, very, very interesting again, because the 10-9 connectivity is very good for the cutoff. Again, there's no straight or anything on the board right now, so the big blind did not hit too much, right? It's still like his over pairs play a huge role in that pot. His nut equity over time, like king, queen, king, jack, queen, jack, all offsuit play a big role here. And therefore he is allowed to see that very high frequency. And here he's checking back again. What does that mean? Right? It's like, again, is it the ace king type of hands is it just eight sevens and nine x always i don't know right so a three on the turn is pretty much as brick as it can get and now we have a situation where i think villain is never improving to something better and his main like main range part should be something that has equity right Either it's a 9 a weak ten it is can be something like king queen king jack so a small sizing wouldn't attack too much what what would i like which hand in villains range would hate to see and face a small sizing here i have no clue right i don't find one so a big sizing is the way to go. Villain should be capped, so overbet is allowed. We have the problem here, though, that we do not have too many nuts ourselves, right? Maybe overbetting, we can start value betting something like king-10. That's like pretty much close to the best 10 that that cutoff could ever have. Queen-10, close, king-10, ace-10, and then it's the fives, threes, nines, tens. Yeahines tens yeah the problem is that or not the problem but we will river like lots of nuts that villain won't have potentially like every four six seven eight jack queen king not sure just is a very very nice spot for us and i like to be a little over aggressive here even with all the overbet options I have for the river. So if the river is in 7 for example, not with my hand, but I can even have an overbet and then jam river range. Villain is never having jack 8 suited, villain is never having 6-8. So it's more like a bet on like the follow-up that can come. We have different options here, but I go with an overbet here quite often. This year is clearly overdoing it but i like that specifically in in that face up lower stakes environment he calls and now i have to realize what my plan was right my plan is that most of the river cards are pretty damn good for me the ace is not one of them just all my air is is still air and my value bets are not necessarily strong value bets anymore even if i had something like nine five it gets counterfeited now by ace ten by ace nine by ace five it's obviously still a great hand but the ace changes quite a lot so i need to make sure to have my give ups here and maybe have certain hands and i'm going crazy with all right i mean four deuce gets there right so i'm giving up here and see something like a very very face up king nine no backdoor flush draw pretty standard check great standard solver check if we look up the frequencies but what we talked about in the community coaching was mainly that people choose the right hands but don't go with frequencies right checking back this year just every time and c betting like a jack 10 every time whereas both of them will be like some bets some check it's just very easy to to end up face up here and then allow myself to put pressure on as thin as possible with hands like queen 10 maybe even jack 10 on that turn so another one that i could note down here but it's very interesting all right next spot six deuce is a defend versus a min race from again unknown guy seems recreational whatever and he checks back jack eight five so recreational checking back is just clear weakness and now we face a turn that brings me lots of nuts right i don't want to go just crazy crazy don't grab anything but here i have all queen ten off suits i have all ten seven suiteds i have all six sevens and i have multiple options what do i want to attack i don't then can have pocket nines okay He can have eight nine but mainly he will just like have ace king ace queen maybe some tens maybe some seven sixes five x and I want to put the pressure as high as possible so here I'm definitely using over bat sizes to attack him this hand is just an idiot gut shot pretty much right the seven is not the best thing so usually this can go in like a small bet to just attack villains ace king type of hands but against nitty recreations i just really really like to overdo it right so my wardrobe for that board is bet small and over bet and this hand i guess fits better in the bet small range and yeah i i decide to just overdo it and go crazy here actually I choose this is now weird I didn't expect that I'm ever choosing that I don't like it all right so nice to look some sometimes things up yeah I don't like it I like a bigger size more or a smaller size both fine he calls and now I'm scared of what happens on the river I just go now for for the overbet. That does not make too much sense, right? It's like if I was overbetting, if I want to represent something that doesn't make any sense and I hate it, right? If I bet like normal again, that's fine. Just fold out king 10, ace 10, whatever. I prefer like the overbet turn, jam river or just small small to attack that kind of shit. This line doesn't make any sense and I have no clue why I chose that. So yeah, Yeah, we need to be honest here. Yeah, that was my turn play here. I got the fold so that's okay all right next one king eight off clear defense against a good wreck you see is a little looser than most of the 22 17 22 18 guys we've seen 26 21 i have 15 000 hands on, so probably he played some zoom 500 with me. I know even the name, so it's more likely he's a good player. And here it goes check, check on a board that is very, very great for the big blind. Villain has checking back lots of random high cards, because I have quite a high check raise frequency here. There's a straight right now. villain doesn't't have too much 3x, 4x, not too much 5x, 6x, which will make nuts over time. So he needs to check back a lot and the turn is a 5. So he has lots of overcards we said. And now, I said it in the intro, how do we attack certain things? It's like against random overcards, definitely small bet just does the job right he is he's drawing that to my six he has 12 versus my random peers and it's just yeah it's tough for him so here a hand like that even having a nut gut shot but nothing else to go with it is perfect just like we're almost stepping full range we can have a little bigger sizing as well that we build a little more around our six acts and bluffs this year fits perfectly in a small sizing villain decides to call and then now the flush gets there i have some flush draws in my small bet size that i now block bet with a plan of re-raising i can still value bet 7x i do have some queen acts that i can play the same way so i'm targeting his ace eyes if he decides to call ace jack on the on the turn which he should ace nine whatever i'm attacking that i'm betting small again not giving up pretty much a single bluff here even though i don't have diamonds or anything and well he went for a loose call with his queen jack offsuit on the turn but that just shows like i mean there's nothing if he doesn't hit there he can't do a he can't even raise his river top here not even against the block bet so this is just a very very promising line that we can do just realizing how good the board is for us all right ace eight suited let's have a look button opening 2.5x we have a typical 22-18 rack flop goes check check on 10-6-7 it's like a decent flop for for the big blind not as great as the lower one right just because button connects better with that 10-6-7 even having like broadway backdoors and stuff so yeah and now we're having that queen on the turn right so it's now the thing that villain obviously improves to quite some queen acts but the main thing here is that he's adding lots of nut equity. On lots of rivers, a river jack, a river king, a river ace, he will have lots of nuts. It's so different, not just because of the queen. If it was let's say let's go one down like nine six five and then we have have a queen that's not as bad. But here, like, the queen forces me to check, like, almost my entire range. I can build some overbetting range that is just attacking something like king-queen right away, that tries to attack villain's ace-jack, ace-king right away, but that has to be, like, a very, very tight and polarized range with strong draws, with like nutted hands, 9, 8 coming to mind, pocket 6s, 7s, maybe some two pairs, stuff like that. So I'm definitely checking this hand here and Will checks back again. River is an ace and now I have a decision to make. Will obviously has lots of aces. He can have ace jack, he can have ace king, ace 8 himself. And I have like some kind of value. And Will might have 7, might have ten nine villain might have six five whatever i have still almost my full range so it's easy for me to find bluff and what i like a lot here is just to put out that block bet on the river to get value from ace five ace four that might not even value bet to lose thejack, ace-king. Check calling is not really a cool option against most of the passive players in Zoom 200 because that he comes up with air here on the river, it's just not possible, right? He needs to turn his pocket threes into a bluff. And this is just something I'm not seeing too often. So I go for the block bet, get the call. He has ace jack which is totally fine but just a good way to navigate through and here since the topic is probing turn after check check on the flop I try to talk most about that about the range play there which obviously helps us to know what are we actually having on the river. I'm having queen high flushes flushes for example i'm checking them on the river as i do the same thing with my just my queen x right i still have like eight nine that i try to check race on the turn with right i might over better them on the river or try to go for a check race i might have something like i don't know pretty much anything right it's like all the categories i can have all kinds of over bad normal bad block bet on that river just because my range is still that wide containing all parts that are possible to have okay let's go this is already the last hand of that session i guess so let's see what what happens here with the queen 10 offsuit low frequency three bets sometimes again another 23 20 guy everything every everyone playing the same preflop style here i defend queen 10 offsuit and now we have like a dream big blind board six four making a straight six nine every nine six four is great cards for me peering the eight seven five is great for me as well he has all the king jack offsuit type of hands so i expect quite a high check back frequency and here on that brick again we have a situation where we can bet a lot right so if we look it up in the solver we are mainly using a small bet which forces villain to raise like something if you check back like king eight on that flop he should raise against the small bet villainil and check back pocket queens on that flop which he should sometimes he should raise against that small bet and now again what we talked about in the coaching was mainly okay what do our nuts want to do our nuts want to get the maximum money in the middle and this is now our turn to decide do we get the maximum money in the middle by taking the solver line, by betting small with 6-9, villain raises and we re-raise? Or do we say, which is very common on those stakes and even more on lower stakes, villain is not raising enough, not bluffing that spot, not trapping enough on the flop that he can raise now. So maybe overbet yourself, right? if I have nine, six or six, six four here i'm super happy to go 150 percent or 200 percent and then just jam the river and find obviously bluffs high equity bluffs to put in the same lines this is what we need to decide on the turn where we need to get away a little from the solver to just see like okay our main part of our range wants to bet small 5x, 7x, 8x attacking villains over cards. Something like queen 10 though doesn't have any nut equities so the high frequency small bet is your way to go put in the same range with something like 5x, 7x, 8x and villain calls river is a 9 so this is one of the best cards because i improved lots of nine x i improved two straights it takes away bluffs from me so i have a mandatory bluff here and yeah i play that like i think it's only the small sizing that makes sense if i have something nutted oh and i'm like what the fuck am i doing i i mean i'm attacking ace jack and ace queen and ace king and I should play it like I play 9-10 and Queen 9. So it's like i hate my sizing so maybe i was not not not not playing that great in that session but yeah i at least got it through so yeah it's again now that would be spots that we can look up in the solver but we need to to have the right view in it because that is already everything that we talk about on the turn is already a reaction game. We are reacting to villain's flop strategy. What is he checking back? How face up is he? How is he playing on the turn? So we need to take that into account and not just think, okay, as if we were playing perfect opponents and should play the perfect lines here. So we need to take that into account and not just think, okay, we were as if we were playing perfect opponents and should play the perfect lines here. So we are a little more free than some people might think with our choices here. And I like to make use of that a lot to just manipulate people or like ranges in the way I like it. i was confused i was like choosing lines i wouldn't choose in hindsight but yeah that as like a couple of hands from my last session to have a little follow-up on the the probing out of position content from the from the community coaching again what should we take away from that is in those spots first take your reads how much do you know about villains range make those notes if they are low frequency checkbacks villains are doing those which hand are they having sometimes we can really tell their hand the next step build your wardrobe on the turn which sizings do make sense given the input you're having and then the execution right? It's which lines do you want to take with your specific hands? How do your nuts want to play? And maybe thinking about the dice principle, the lookalike principle, what is actually working best for your hands. So yeah, I hope that helped you a little get some insights from that and yeah as always feel free to post as many hands as possible in the cash game hands analysis section like link that video go for that spot find fancy situations where you can go for crazy bluffs where you can go for crazy thin value because people are face up or make ridiculous folds because you know their hand i'm always happy to see that and until the next time yeah see you around
