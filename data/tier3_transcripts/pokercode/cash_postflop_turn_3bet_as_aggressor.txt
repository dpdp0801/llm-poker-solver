### TOPIC: cash postflop turn 3bet as aggressor
 Three-bet pots are just awesome. That's hopefully true, especially as the aggressor. We'll discuss being the aggressor today and focus a little on the turn play. I mean, flop is kind of easy, so we worked on that in the videos. I wouldn't change anything on that on the platform. Those videos, three-bet pot in position on the flop. We'll discuss the turn a little more. We actually do have a kahoot today, so I didn't put in all the details. So everything I talk about is 100 big blinds. So things are changing slightly when we get shorter because we have the all-in option. We have the risk of getting set all in different points throughout the hand. So that changes strategy from like equity driven way more towards polarizing. So everything I'm saying today is meant for 100 big blinds or maybe even more. Let's start with the title. We are playing three bad pots today in position as the aggressor, focusing on having a linear range or a somewhat linear range. That can mean that it's not that we need to be three bad, like play three bad only in those spots, which in cash game we mainly do or pretty much always do. Aetherius is not the biggest whale of all times and an MP and cutoff, but it counts for the button as well. And when I talk about about cash game button it actually is quite equal to all tournament strategies where yes you have less pocket eights pocket nines pocket sevens because you mainly flat them deep but still you are three betting them sometimes so that's what i mean with the somewhat linear range it has everything it's not like we are missing a part right we want to talk about ranges where villain has the gaps in his range. We might have trouble not covering pocket deuces and pocket threes, which shouldn't be a huge problem for 100 big blinds. It might be a problem a little deeper. So it's about the out of position defender, not having aces, not having kings and us having all of it and not having board coverage problems when it's like 7, 8, 9 or 10, 8, 6 or something like that. So that's what I mean with a somewhat linear range. This is what we are talking about today. And this is the plan as it looks like for today. As always, I just repeat the spot, a five second slide, then we'll quickly recap the flop strategy. Since I know you guys and you're all hardworking, you probably just as preparation for the coaching, you double checked on the platform, which videos are there on for three bad pot in position, you found two or three or four or five, and you went through all of them. And in case you forgot them since this morning, when you went through all those videos, I will just recap that quickly. But that's not the main focus today. Because you know, you guys mainly even play MTTs and flop is quite easy, right? You see that small and then hope for the best i'm ready for some mtt needles today i'm loving it so yeah then we'll actually have a fast-paced kahoot quiz to just see how much you fuck up and then talk about turn theory so what we plan is we spot our own mistakes we inject some theory and then we try to do better or in this case it was i didn't want to prepare it like another Kahoot and then do the same thing again. So actually it will be me playing GTO Wiz, but I'm only your mouse. We'll go with a fast paced chat vote and click some buttons, right? So some button clicking, focusing on the turn, playing some of those spots. It's not the main thing. So it won't be me playing GTO Wizard and you have to watch it all over again. i'll probably do that as a little extension to that coaching that you can watch in the video on your phone in the metro something like that but today just a fast pace we'll break it down to very easy and simple strategy i would say how we can apply that in game to at least see once or twice or three times that it's working and i really pray for not weird spots coming up i trained that two times today and I messed up big time. So this is what you can expect. And then obviously the key takeaways. We're supposed to have coverage on 7, 8, 9. Does this include a nut advantage? This is like some random words. We don't want to be idiots, right? We want to sit there and sometimes have nines and sometimes have eights and sometimes have sevens and sometimes have jacked and suited. That's good enough. Obviously there are some boards where out of takes over slightly the nut advantage and is allowed to be donking, but that's not the main focus. You can expect that I'm messing up weird spots, and this is why we hope for very easy spots. Okay, that's the entire MTT game plan. Here we go. All right, so this spot, I hope you got it by now already. Someone raises first in. We're in position today. We love the position, and we decide to three bet. I explained that already. A somewhat linear range. Just meaning we are not missing anything of the top hand part. So we are not saying we three bet aces, queens, and tens. And we flat kings and jacks for a miracle reason. We have all of that. And even those next tens, we have them at least sometimes. Nines, eights, sevens, king, jack suited, king, ten suited. We even want to have some to have some king jack offsuit in the correct ranges sometimes so and now what happens is obviously we don't face the fold because then we play perfectly and we don't care anymore and we didn't face the four bet either so we face a call from the open razor no fancy cold calling no three way pots and we see a flop heads up i should have mentioned that maybe so that's what we were talking about today. And yeah, let's start with a little recap. And it was really easy. So a little recap of the flop strategy. You don't need to read that. It's way too much text on a slide. And actually what I presented in the videos, I made it as like three different things. Actually, when we talk about action game, about us making the rules, not those donking boards, it's about two CBAT strategies that we can can just summarize quickly like that. Strategy A is we bet small, very high frequency, very often just range betting. We have an advantage and we keep it over time. This is why we don't need to charge villain for seeing more cards right now. More cards are good for us. We can live with that. We attack villain's weakest part that has some kind of equity that can lead to different small sizings. I said only small. We want to attack a certain part that villain has. It's usually the weakest part he has in his range that has equity against us or against our value hands. So if we think I make two, three examples, king 10, four villain has pocket sixes. We see that quarter pot. He hates his life with sixes and falls or makes a bad call. We don care but the big upside is that if the turn is a six it's a freaking brick and bricks are good for us so yeah that's kind of the plan what to do on that flop queen jack five is exactly the same thing we can see that full range with a small sizing we can cheat a little with some other hands and even bet bigger if we look that up in gto wizard we can cheat a little and check back some pocket tens and jack eggs i clearly recommend just clicking one button with your entire range and you're sure you're doing a good job on the flop so then maybe another example is ace king deuce rainbow we are actually we have the same plan we want to make something like six seven or an eight we want that to be a brick on the turn after a villain check called that but on that board actually we are so freaking strong and we always have something because the high cards are smashing and we have lots of ace x and king x usually on those ranges that villains pocket peers are just like happily snap folding against the 25 that we can actually decrease the sizing even further and go like 20 maybe even 15 maybe 10 which looks freaking cool right from players we can use the freaking min bet button and see people ate their life. So nuts can still go all in over time. Those strong hands will stay strong on all runouts. So that's no big deal. Saying here, small bet, high frequencies, plan A, not saying that it's always third pot or a quarter pot or 10%. We can deviate there slightly slightly just understanding what we are attacking so something like a mono board where we know maybe i should have put that in a slide because it's pretty nice to visualize villains range and actually i'll just turn things around and ask you a question while talking so much is can someone give me a very very very very very short breakdown of how a cash game out of position call three bad range looks like the shortest breakdown of all times i need someone to step up all right even easier too specific kaihoudi but perfect going in the Thank you. cash game out of position call three bad range looks like the shortest breakdown of all times i need someone to step up all right even easier too specific kai hoodie but perfect going in the perfect direction even easier just try to use less words and try and think about your answer is perfect so for everyone in discord omg kai hoodie in zoom just says middle pocket pairs and a couple of suited broadways just think about which of those words can you kill so, like, try to give an answer that my mom would understand. My mom doesn't understand high implied odds, not equity driven, not condensed. Here we go. McLovin1308 says gears and suited broadways. Tucker says suited high cards and pairs. I would go a little further and just say suited hands and pairs. Like, obviously he has suited high cards a little more often than suited low cards, but still six seven suited four five suited seven eight suited are in there and pocket pairs for us cash gamers ace queen off in all those positions is either four bet bluff or a fold so there are really really only a few positions where we three bet a linear range right this means big blind versus small one is not part of the coaching session today where ace queen off is really a call out of position maybe we play some no rate games and that can happen cutoff versus button and that's about it right so it's really they don't have offsuit hands they have pairs and suited hands and this helps for making up those c-bets strategies right king 10-4 what we attack obviously we attack freaking pocket pairs queen jack five same thing ace king do same thing mono board what does villain have well a pocket pair without the flush draw. You need only a small size against that. The pocket pair with a flush draw, or he has a flush or bullshit. Obviously, you can have some King-Jack of hearts as well. But this is just for visualization reasons. Are we attacking suited hands or are we attacking pockets? And you have a good strategy. Right, brings us to strategy B, which the B coincidence stands for a big bad board where our advantage decreases over time. That could mean that runouts can get ugly and we want to finish the hand now as often as possible, or in a way that like the flop is so great for us that it can't get even better. So I started with the first one, deuce, deuce, deuce. It's not really getting bad over time if there's a high card, but just our advantage is queens, kings, aces, and it just doesn't get better than that. So we want to charge his pocket eights to the maximum right now. His pocket sevens, his pocket nine. So we need the big sizing here. 10-5-2 is kind of the same thing. Nothing hits, right? 10-8-5. Even something like queen three deuce, we attack the pocket pairs with a bigger sizing than small, and any turn card will give villain some sets. So this is where we see mainly bigger sizing being used. of those boards are kind of mixes in gto wizard but if you put it in often one size strategy is great so i chose only boards that are really good for us there are obviously some that are not as great where we need a bet size and a check back as well those are mainly boards that we can almost bet entire range on and yeah there will be something like a queen five six maybe which is actually fine to range better right or it's something like a nine eight five that is not that great but there's there's some merit for a big bet as well what's the range of big bet in a three-bet pot for me it's like 50 to 75 so pavel asked that what's the range of big bet it's like like yeah 50 to 75 i think with my three bet pot sizings it's like something between 60 and 65 is the 3e sizing for the flop or even 58 something like that but we are in that region polarizing already there and kind of using geometric bet sizing so but if you take 70 66 that's all fine all right that was it 10 minutes lobster we are done. And actually we could do that now in GTO Wizard. And I think we wouldn't make any major mistake. I'm pretty confident in this one because it's very tough to make a clear mistake once you, well, as long as you don't go pot on like Ace King deuce. So that should be pretty cool. And now that brings us to turn theory. And turn theory, obviously I need one program that me. Biggest solver program in the world. Here we go. So now we want to ask ourselves, what are our potential turn strategies? Villain calls. I'm not interested in villain check raising. And we are in reaction game, totally different game tree. But yeah, villain calls. We see a turn card and what's happening. I think we have done that already a couple of times in the stingRay spot. And didn't I want to run the Kahoot first and then talk about turn theory? Get out your phones or screens or whatever. You got to join that Kahoot here. Kahoot.it. Sorry for the confusion, but I think that's fine. Would it be correct to say a big bet in a three bet pot is kind of close to a medium-sized bet? Yes, if you're talking to a percentage of the pot, absolutely. It's just for me, everything is relative to the stack size. So to all the tournament players, actually like a 30% pot bet can be a big bet if you just are super short. So it's like, it's a little how you understand it. If you really are just into the number of the percentage you click, that's absolutely true. Love the S. Donkheimer, seeing this one. Name 11 junior, range 3-bet, c-bet. Some great names. It's just six questions, 20 seconds time. I'm asking you, I tell you, because I want you to have the time to think. I give you a board and a turn card. We go, like the first board is something like king 10-3. Like, I don't know, something like that, where we c-bet small. We did that with our entire range and you will see a turn card. And I'll just ask you for your highest frequency, not for yours, but for GTO Wizard's highest frequency seabed sizing on the turn. So that's the goal here to find out. And that will be the same. The second board will be the board where we use a big bet, a half pot or something like that. So good luck. Click fast, 20 seconds time. Cutoff versus middle position. You seabed small on king, 10, deuce, rainbow. What is your preferred turn sizing on an offsuit five on the turn? All right, that was like one of the easiest ones. On a single race part, it would be definitely the 124. But here, given that we play 100 big blinds, it should be around 75 or something like 80% should be the geometric sizing that we want to use on such a brick. Don't be confused. The less than 34% is just because I put 33 and 20 together that GTO Wizard suggests, because it doesn't make a real difference in all the spots we have here so yeah we don't see that here here it's clear polarization we have a certain value threshold that wants to go directional in on that cart and we add some bluffs that have the same plan and yeah any river will be kind of a break because it's rainbow and well billum cannot continue with any draws. So he'll sit on a lot of king queen. So yeah, easiest one. Next question is exactly the same thing, just with a different turn. Offsuit ace on the turn. Everything in our bluffing range is improving. All right. We got a size down. We got a size down. We'll talk about the why a little later. Villainous improving as well. We improve. It's just, yeah, we don't need a big sizing to attack a big part in Villainous range. And this is always our goal. We are not after his turn ace queen right now. We are after that on the river probably. So very nice seeing the size down overall for everyone who clicked 50%. I'm still happy with that just important to to see okay in which direction we are we're deviating and now maybe an interesting one another turn card again same board and we got the 10 on the turn all right so size down absolutely correct again. We're not improving as much. So we have clearly way lower betting frequency than on the ace. That allows us to go a little bigger, right? Our betting hands are slightly stronger on average, so we can take a bigger sizing. And this is something that works for us, like our king X, as well as for our 10X, obviously, that will will over bet jam the river then we can have a look at that later if we have some time and maybe to answer sluggy's question is king 10 5 a dynamic flop yes kind of obviously things are changing i wonder because we put in a small bet on the flop yes it's not about it's dynamic or not it is about do we cover whatever happens when turn card changes something? And here we cover ace queen, we cover ace jack, we cover queen jack, we cover maybe even queen nine suited, jack nine suited. So we don't mind, right? It's just shifting like the strength within our range. Like when the turn is a queen, aces are not as great anymore, but we got ace jack. So we don't mind those cards, right? It's just important that we choose a sizing to make an eight a brick a seven a brick a six a brick a five four three so we have half of the board will be bricks and the other half is something that we have fully covered exactly now we get the next board these were the first three same questions kind of for the second board the board this time we did that big big i think i mean half pot is the the highest frequency bet size on the next board on the flop and then we'll discuss the turn let's go your big c bet here i say it's 50 on nine five twos with a flush draw what is your preferred turn sizing on an offsuit king on the turn all right between 50 75 but you see like if we see that as kind of a representation of what you guys are doing, it looks pretty damn good. You bet small on the small bet boards here, it's like yeah, 75% won't hurt that much. 50 is the highest frequency sizing. And let's get to the next one. Turn king again, but flush getting there. What is the flush change? Flush high card. All right, here we go. The size down again. Things change a little more. So actually, we need less of a sizing to attack the same part that we wanted to attack on the offsuit king. Our villain might have something like a six, seven of spades. They might have something like pocket 8s without a heart, pocket 10s without a heart. They might have 4-5, ace 5, 9-8, 10-9, something like that. Villain does have ace queen of spades, which is all now absolute garbage and needs to snap fold to even such a small bet. So we can leverage our risk reward here. And this is what we do with further downsizing while not investing too much into Villain's obvious uncapped range that he has on that flush turn. Right, last card. Good luck with that one. Last turn card. Seven of diamonds. Exactly what you ordered. All right, it's kind of a break. Obviously, Villain improves to like, I call like equity robust hands, like sixes, eights, they add something, right? It's like they will call like a normal sizing, always like five, six, seven, eight, seven, six. So Villain is kind of improving. But the only thing that really improves to nuts right now is pocket sevens. And villain only has that just like sometimes. And that means we are just polarizing and go bluff or value that plants to go all the way on a river break mainly. Yeah, actually pretty good job here. I absolutely understand the guys that want to size up. I need to say option number four, the 125 just never exists with the stack that we are having. It will if we are deeper. So the thought is not wrong, but for the given situation, it's just never there. It's just kind of, I needed to put in number four in there. So yeah, let's double check. I guess Jerome has to take it down here. Name 11 junior, nevermore. All right. And Jerome crushing. Like some sides would ban you for RTA now, I would guess. All right, good job, guys. I'll kill this one here. That was just this small part. And now for really maybe diving slightly deeper, my paint explanation for why that is the case. So now I want to go with a couple of steps. The first thing is villain's range after check calling. We are still on the flop. Villain decides just the moment he decides to call. how is villain's range looking in my graph visualization can anyone describe that in either the discord or the zoom chat i'll read it out loud for the others all right easy just awesome got it here top and bottom removed is all he says and that's all that is needed right so let's say villain flops kind of a linear range maybe a little cap maybe not who knows depends on the exact word but on average he will raise some of his strongest hands so they disappear and he clearly folds his weakest hands so they disappear so something like this right just a very very very easy representation obviously villain can trap some nuts villain hopefully for him is not like floating with some. So it should be like that a little, right? But for the sake of it, we are just saying it's the middle stuff. And now all we need to be doing is seeing the turn card. And well, turn card always changes the range. So which turn cards do not change the range? Bricks, bricks, left, right, perfect. All right. So let's actually say, let's call it 2A, right right we get a brick and then we target this range and well we all know how to target that range and this is with big bets right he has medium strong he has a bluff catcher we build a polarized range and fuck him up right so that's the plan and we do that for well depending on our stack depth geometric sizing so here it's creams 2e here right for everyone who is new or a beginner it's like i know i use lots of birds and i'm rushing through it but you will see that over and over again this just means we try to get directional in over two streets we want to use maximum leverage of our stack we have the event we have mid set we see that mid set on the flop every single time when we have bottom set we see that every single time when we have top set yes we block his top pairs but still our goal is to get directional in when we have aces on a king high queen high board still 400 bigs 150 bigs our goal is to go directional in so this is how we achieve that and this is why on all the bricks in that situation it was like this is where the 75 maybe 85 depending on the stack depth right depending on stack depth if we are super deep and we have super bricks spots it can be two times spot like in a single race pot in three bad plots as well if we play 300 big blinds deep we are using our stack so here i focus on on the 75, 85, something like that, that is common for 100 BB deep cash game. MTG Dongies wonders if there's any two-street poker and three of pots in cash, or is it always getting money in over three streets? For 100 bigs, I've never seen a spot in lifetime. It's like max protection spots. We can have that out of position. Like out of position, we have additional incentive to end the hand early. Ending the hand early when the money is all in, it means there is no positional advantage anymore. It's not like we run the board and in position gets an advantage. No. So out of position always has incentive to kind of kill the positional advantage. But for 100 bix, it's tough. So there are some spots like 9-5-2s with a flush draw that you want to pot on the flop. and then have like a 140 turn over bet jam on a double flush draw card that brings lots of pair plus plus gut shots or something like that like nine five deuce seven double flush draw something like that exists but that's about it omg kairodi going with a absolutely special one we see that in four bet pots a lot where stack to pot ratio is way, or we see that in three bet pots for like 40 big blind guys closer to MTT. And then we see that quite a lot, but here in like very, very, very, very special ones, we can even find that, but usually never in position. Just imagine, just awesome, right? It's like you have their Macau super whale sitting, you sit on ace king. Do you think he will fold ace queen on the turn which you are just making indifferent right now no he won't right and then it's just better to win a 500 big blind pot or a 2000 big blind pot with set over set and call it a cooler instead of winning 150 bigs of him so this is where we need to leverage our advantage all right to be we have the same thing again And now we let the board change, right? 2B read for a change. What happens? Some medium part gets very strong. Here we go, Toby in Discord says it. Some medium part gets very strong. This is the new nuts. But it's important that the medium part is missing now, right? Because it's the combination of those two things. I move this here. This just made a turn set. He turns equity or equity shifts, right? Exactly. What means, like, I like to be more precise with that. This is like all those general words that are always correct. But what that means is actually some hands get slightly stronger. This year adds a gut shot. So medium strong hand adds a gut shot, but this year is only one street. And whenever something gets stronger, because we talk relative hand strength, everything else gets weaker in a way this year is relatively weaker now even though this hand got stronger and this year got stronger right so let's say okay he didn't even just add a set he just added a pair plus flush draw this year is here at the same time some of the backdoor flush draws now know they are just some shit and they won't make a flush. So they actually move down. A hand that was medium strong on the flop, maybe quite a promising backdoor with, I don't know, with a peer, without a peer, just got weaker. In my head, I see that as like the range kind of gets stretched. How does that representation now look like to you? If you describe a range, how does it look like? Just what we see here under 2 see here under 2b more linear okay nuts come in and villain becomes more polar more linear here we go it looks like a linear range what did we face on the flop what did we just say we said it's kind of a linear range like some boards are good for him some bad but he will have some some sets he will have some bullshit he will have cover everything he will have some middle strong and now because of the turn card when it changes something it's scratching his his condensed range it changes some of the medium strong hands to nut hands while some of the medium strong hands from the flop now are actually weak hands which means there are different parts we can attack and this is where our bet sizings come from and so actually now there is not one sizing correct because it depends on the on the board exactly or actually there can be turn cards where multiple sizings make a lot of sense because we have very different parts to attack this year if you look at that how do you want to attack that do you you want to take a size where it just like this year would represent like a very small size right the rectangle stands for the part of his range we force villain to defend look at his hands he's laughing at that they are all in the box he's super happy it's like you sit there with top pairs and mid pairs only and someone bets like 15 against you a fish who just comes from fixed limit like okay you call your mid pair again like it's okay right so this sizing doesn't make any sense does it make sense to just like bet three times pot and not leverage your positional advantage maybe in a way he can't do anything you're just missing like your positional advantage it would make sense anyway so you rather choose something where he feels uncomfortable with almost all his hands like something like this right maybe even something like this just target that here like we forced him to still defend, I don't know, half of his range, but like everything he has feels like, ah, fuck, like this is not what I want to play for. Then it's a good sizing. And here, this sizing could make sense. This sizing could make sense. This sizing could make sense. This sizing could make sense. So this is where all the different sizings come from. But now I want to remember what we said in one of the earlier slides today, that we try to target the weakest part of his range that has equity against our value hands. And often that is actually the weakest part he's having. So it's like 9-5 deuce. Villain calls with ace-queen suited backdoor flush draw. Turn is a king with a different flush draw. This is now ace-queen has equity against our pocket tens, against our nine, against our bluffs like ace-five. So it's like, this is what we want to get rid of. And on boards like that, we have seen it in the quiz, like a 33% sizing was perfect, right? Or less than 34. Maybe we can go even smaller and then go from there, right? Gives us still options, right? And that actually brings us back to flop strategy. This year is nothing else but flop strategy, where we can see like, okay, on the flop, we also had boards where we go small and somewhere we go a little bigger. This is exactly the same here. All right. So I think enough paint games for now. I hope it was kind of a nice visualization to understand where things are coming from. So whenever there's a brick, we have one sizing and that's kind of the correct sizing, a little deviation, depending on like how brickish something really is, right? It's like nine, seven deuce is a turn five, a brick, or is it not seven, six, adding a gut shot pocket eight setting gut shot it's like kind of a break but not really if like ace king deuce and then maybe another six is like the real real real brick but we clearly see that there will only be one bet size maybe we want to support two parts and have like one bet sizing that supports those hands that want to value that turn but not river. But I'm more focusing on the importance of like the hands that want to go all in. I hope that was kind of understandable and not too wild. This is how I see it. And that helps me hopefully in what is planned next. Let me see. And everything we ask ourselves is really, did the turn card change any range part of villain significantly? The more change there is really think about to be the more flexible our sizings need to be it can be fine to bet big it can be fine to bet like something in between it can be fine to add a small sizing and then the bricks lead to sebarino sizing the two e sizings geometric sizings and this is a little reminder here always attack the weakest part in villain's range that has significant equity against our value hands. Not saying that we need to do that with all our hands, but this is always our first logic. Okay. What's our sizing we need here? What do we need? Because this is the cheapest bluffs we can put in there. And we love cheap bluffs and like thinnest value bets for protection and so on. It's just a rule that works quite often. Right. Example GTO wizard drills. And now we'll test the whole shit and let's see whether this is some bullshit strategy. Yeah. Let's see. I just hope that I don't face too many check raises. Start training. So we play cut off versus hijack and obviously flop the world. And now actually, I just want you to be involved and let's use letters, right? X is for check. We don't use that too often because we try to use sizings and we use s just for small because i'm not interested in the exact bet size often it will be a mix we use s for small m for medium and b for big you can make your choice just really always try to speed up i get three four five answers that's perfect right so here we bet small, we attack freaking jack ten of hearts. Just think about we have pocket nines. It's like what is this weakest part with equity? We attack pocket sixes with no spit. That's small. I don't use the 20 personally, I use 27 as a hotkey so I don't mind what I'm clicking. I'm clicking this here now and we see it's perfectly fine and obviously this would be perfectly fine as well.. Well here, half putting, it's not a mistake, but we see already what's going on. This is always how GTO Wizard is working and we want to understand that, right? We just had ace eight of clubs and we fold out 10, nine of hearts. That's a big success, right? So let's go. Big, big, big, big, big, big, big. So big here for me is either this or that. I said half put plus, actually there's on the flop flop there is no medium for me because we talked about two different kinds of strategies i simplify to half pot here against some people where i know that they don't have threes and fours i go 75 but definitely the big one and now what do we do in the turn okay chevy b checking our hands couple a couple more checks uh x for check please to. I always see the C as calling and it kills me. So let's say we have a different hand. A hand we want to bet. What's our sizing? Tucker wants to bet 75%. That's kind of the break board we had. We had like nine, five deuce and then the seven. So I think the main sizing here really is the 75%. And now this is always like, this is now tough in GTO Wizard. There's always only one sizing correct, like in those reverse those reverse situations or most often we're like this will be the same in game i'll be the greedy one and okay i was lucky that both are fine right let's see turn is a clear check and we know that here or it is kind of a break i play personally 75 or nothing let's just look it up there will be slight deviations obviously because some hands are fine to bet smallish or half pot and so on, but it should be pretty clear, right? We see nothing, nothing, nothing. 37% bets 75%. Little half pot can't hurt. Nothing, nothing. This is exactly what I just tried to describe in paint. This is a board like this. This is freaking 2A. Whether you target it here, which would be like maybe 85 that GTO Wizard doesn't offer, or you take 75, or you take 60, doesn't matter. But this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, and this is wrong, right? While here, in different bot 2b, we will see more deviations. All right, let's go for the next. Pocket aces, small or big? Big from Jerome, big from Alex. Promote, Nevermore. Big, big, big. We get 7-7-0 big. Let's go. Okay, now this different spot. We just play it. Check. This, this, this. Even check. Who knows? Small. I'm fine with both. I'll go super small. And we messed up and we need to bet bigger. Okay, that's fine. This is not what I'm interested in right now. So actually losing one big blind here is bad. But the 4-5 and so on, I need to charge that. Makes sense in hindsight, but I was already thinking about the next 10. Let's go small or big. Obviously check is an option on that board, but if we are betting small or big, big, big, big, big, big, small, one small, eight bigs. All right, let's go big. All right, here we go. Small, medium, big, medium, medium, medium, medium, medium, medium, one small, medium. Interesting. I think this hand can do anything. It's important that we bet smallish, mediumish, or like main sizing will be medium. We have seen the nine, what was it? Nine, five, deuce, king with a flush draw where the main sizing was 50 in the Kahoot quiz. So I think this has to be similar. What are we attacking? With the small sizing, we are attacking nine, 10 of clubs. We are attacking ace, queen of spades. Not with our hand, but you know what I mean, right? With a bigger sizing, we are attacking pocket fives. We're attacking ace queen of spades not with our hand but you know what i mean right with a bigger sizing we're attacking pocket fives we're attacking pocket eights pocket nine so we can easily value by jacks and tens we can have cheap bluffs that have equity so just gives us lots of rooms right here i think if we unblock the turned king have aces for example that's the one that we might even go for 75 that's like a little up and down there i'll go for 50 i think that was what the majority of you wanted and against check race i mean we won't be folding right maybe as the queen of hearts not a jam now here this is important don't call me out for the mess ups please here i'm clicking buttons after that and this is kind of we see everything is fine we see already that this is the major sizing we're using let's quickly double check on that. Just understanding that and not capping yourself to the 75% button right here. Interesting that tens and jacks actually want to check back. I didn't expect that. I'm actually, if we put it in PIO, we can get away with a turn range bet. I can tell you that would be slightly different strategy. So I wouldn't have expected this pocket tens check back here. Jacks being indifferent. But yeah, just giving yourself some leverage. Let's double check the flop with our ace king of spades. We clearly focus on the big bet. No small bet at all. So important for everyone. Small bet is not attacking anything. It's like all the backdoors. It's only clubs. You attack club broadways. That's it. Everything else has an easy call against a small bet. So we go for like half pot or even bigger. All right. We get another three, four, five hands in. Now this is an interesting one. So small or big, small, small, small, small, big. 10% is not an option, unfortunately here. Small, small, small. And I think 10% on this flush draw board is a little less interesting. We could put it into bio and it would exist because it just makes sense. This is something I want to tell you as well. If you know what you're targeting and it makes sense, then it will be in at least an okay sizing as long as you know that stuff, right? So here, when there is a flush draw, I prefer the slightly bigger size because it's very easy to navigate against the small size. You fold pocket fives without the spades, you call the one with, very different to a rainbow board where you hate your life with all the pocket fives. So i just go like this even the 20 is the higher frequency but since this is combined in my strategies as one that's the small clubs fold on the flop already last 10 mainly right no back door flush show yeah i said on the flop we are only targeting clubs with the small sizing on the flop sorry maybe i was too fast there this is why the small sizing doesn't exist on those low rainbow boards, because what are we attacking? Literally nothing. Jack-10 of clubs is not even a high frequency call out of position. Turn, the small size would attack like lower pockets or like an ace queen of spades, like the backdoors that kind of missed. All right, I'm feeling good. We see those exclamation marks. I don't care about those, but flop and turn, we play perfect so far. Ace, ace, jack. Small, small, small. Let's not talk about it for too long. We face the donk. We fold pocket sixes, I guess. Again, here, 20% is absolutely an option. It's the same bullshit. 8, 6, 4. I'm not allowing the check. Big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big. So now what is interesting? Because it's not a rainbow board, we could see that small. It will be at least some percentages, I guess, because now we're not attacking like in the board before, like clubs only. Here we are actually attacking clubs and diamonds. So we just doubled the range part that we can attack with a small sizing, which makes it a slightly more interesting to use a small sizing on a flush drop board compared to a rainbow board, right? But I'm with you. Eight high board is like half pot or this year is both fine. Should be the standard. Are we betting anything good happening? If we bet, I don't think so. Let's check this one and let's freaking rip it. And we are not allowed to rip because he has the boats and I don't care. All right. So here, check is the one. We see some small betting here because it exists on that board. The big bet is let's double check that as well. So maybe like a small hint here, how rainbow and flush draw actually changes stuff. People are used to bet bigger actually because there is a flush draw because they are not thinking about the weakest part. They are thinking about what they are scared of. Actually, you want to bet big on rainbow and it's not that bad to bet smaller here, right? You could even more, the small bet is not really a thing, but on a rainbow board, it will be more of the 75 and less of the 50 and here's the other way around just slight understanding of what you're doing there okay what do you can answer that for yourself what are you attacking when you bet on the straight board yes absolutely you're attacking it's easy falls for like ace queen type of fans so it makes sense but we are still mainly using half pot if there are two callers pre-flop that's a wild spot that shouldn't come up too often in the three-bet pot, but then it's not good to choose bigger. See them as a team. They have double the nuts, so actually you want to use more small sizings there. Let's do two more heads. Jack ten four with a flush draw. Big or small? Small. Big. Small big. I'll take whatever Ziggo Poker aka Stefan Pantheimer puts in. You're responsible for this one now. Small, you go small. Okay, I think actually both is fine and you were free rolling and you managed the highest frequency. Let's go. Now this doesn't count as last 10. We just click this here and we want to have one more turn. One last turn. Now smaller or big on the flop? Big, big, big. We've learned that by now, right? We have this here. We go for this. And now let's go, guys. I need some good good answers now for the seven of spades. We have a flush getting there. It's an undercard to the board. A card that we do not really cover. So yeah, what are you up to? Small, big, small, big, check. Small, small, small to medium. After he said big, Tobi just trying all of them. Okay, like closing eyes and going like any sizing Tobi, like that. Small and push river. So small like this. We have most small. Definitely we need to downsize here. I think with the ace of spades we can already have a range that goes big big. Just saying now we go directional in. I clearly prefer something that keeps our range together, that allows us to bet kings without spade, anything like that. And where kings with the spade to keep stuff in. I personally play the half pot here. I think the third is fine as well. Let's try Toby tactic, rub the belly and click you said mainly small. So I'll take this as small and let's try and nail it. And now we got it kids, right? We got it. Okay, now C for chicken and H for hero. Okay, hero, hero. Just awesome goes for the chicken. Hero, we got more heroes in here. Me who are for the chicken, more heroes chicken more heroes okay heroes we go so here it is actually often a check realize equity if not we take the 50 but let's have a look at the total range our hand is very very special because we block the main folding range with the king of hearts as well so i was really interested in this one but i'm more interested in range play here and i think there should be lots of half potting which i chose here and some small which is fine so that's kind of cool right it changed and one very last question now i'll change the seven of spades again to the king of spades what do we do with our hand we have ace of spades king of hearts what do we do with the ace of spades king of hearts on the king of spades turn 33 33 with a different king we bet more often i guess this is exactly the king of hearts is really bad so let's have a look at this ace of spades we see how the king of hearts is just worse than the other kings so very good understanding here for just small things what are we attacking right king of hearts blocking two three combos that villain calls flop false turn makes already a difference so we got the small small small small small small small small king of spades. I think that's absolutely right. I need to put in river. Let's take a lucky one. This is where we see the small sizing. I think half-bought can't be wrong because we have it. Actually check can be fine as well. That's cool. I think that was very nice. Even though I punted left and right with those ones where who am I not jamming that against? Sure, I'm betting 42 instead of 76 because then some people end up calling. Forget about it. The games I'm playing, this is the freaking button I'm clicking and the games you are mainly playing is definitely this button. Just shut up, GTO wizard. Yeah, so I like that a lot. That worked out fine. This brings us to the end already. So I tried to present actually a very, very, very simple way of getting to sizings, flop and turn. And then you see it's fine to mess up rivers left and right. And actually we didn't lose too much EV there because mainly we don't get to the river when we apply correct pressure. So what is important for me always is that you know your flop strategy. Did you mix sizings like a wild, I don't know, something? Or do you play range bet 27 or 33% or range bet 10%? Or did you go for the 50? Lots of you will flick in the 75% bet when you have exactly jacks on 10, five deuce, but you go 50% when you have aces. That's something you want to be doing or not, right? Think about that. Know your flop strategy and then evaluate the turn card, right? The paint games have that in mind. We had two A and two B and obviously two B can have like very different types of how far the condensed range gets stretched how much of a strong part is there now how much of a weak part really looking down at the combos three bad pop every card means something we have seen how much of a difference the king of hearts in our hand just made and yeah that is just very very important and then best case if you're really crushing you know exactly what you're attacking you know what you're doing. And if you can speak that out loud, even better. If you can tell me 9-5-2s turn king, I'm using this sizing to attack pocket eights, pocket sevens. Attack in the sense to make villain hate his life. Then you're doing a good job. And there's no way the sizing will be wrong. If you tell me I jam three times pot now because he can't let go themed king and you have a freaking set, I think like, yeah, maybe he won't let a king go over two streets either, but at least it makes somewhat sense, right? If he open folds the king to you now, then that sucked. But still, it's really just once you have logic behind your sizing, instead of just clicking the button, it's just so likely it's good. That's something I see with all private students I'm having. Once I make them talk, there are no mess ups, like river mess ups. But like with that strategical thing, flop plan, turn plan, it's actually really easy. And I think all of you are the majority of you putting in the smalls, mediums, bigs here in the chat nailed like at least 90% or like we played 10, let's say 70, 80% of the words we got. So here, a very good point coming up in the chat. I read it out loud for everyone. Lesson from today, be the in-position guy, not the out-of-position guy. Be the guy who sets the rules. You can three bet out of position as well, having an advantage and you are still setting the rules. That's cool. And Jerome says, say we three bet more in position these spots because this is our money-making spot. Any important changes? Know that you're over-folding adjust by calling four bets more often do that against people who under four bet that's your money making spot that's perfect i'm over three betting on the button big time the weaker the opponent the more i'm doing it once the rate goes up the out of position range is folding many of the pockets pre i need to change that kaiori because i think it's not true i gotta rephrase that once the rate goes up the out of position range is supposed to be folding the pocket spree is that really happening in my experience mainly no pockets were in the 1kg simpson whiz yes but in reality the pockets are there so it's really really good to know is your opponent folding 59 or is he folding 45 to three bets out of position this is just the pocket pairs some people love them call all of them some people are folding them because they know they don't make money and they just pay rake Thank you. five percent to three bets out of position this is just the pocket pairs some people love them call all of them some people are folding them because they know they don't make money and they just pay rake against good opponents i'm playing 59 fold to three bet you won't find many pockets in my range you rather attack something else i flick in the frequencies as i should i try at least and some other people have the 43 this is exactly when you know like okay they have 100 percent of sixes 100 percent of sevens which obviously makes it even more important to a be careful about sets but when they hit the sets they have all the pockets in between as well so that's even more interesting but to know how important it is to keep going on something like nine five deuce king they have all the sixes all the sevens all the pocket eights and keep blasting and so they will overfold turns and rivers because their range is just too wide and weak and no one is calling down like random pocket pairs if not i mean we have the value bets as well that's not a big deal all right just because they show up with the pocket doesn't mean they call it 100 exactly you will see me with pockets but still see me folding 60 that means lots of pockets going in the mug all right so i hope you enjoyed that one yeah leave me a comment anywhere in discord i will definitely talk a little more do like a 30 minute gto wizard video the ones as i tried together with you now to just give you some time if you want to take a look and want to see some more praxis how i talk about flop turn there and make those decisions to maybe see even that this pretty much works out all the time and we only mess up when we get check raised and we have to play river but that's okay then because this is where things get more on the exploitative side where ranges are actually different a lot to the ones of gto wizard yeah it's getting easier for me to make an argument that my sizing makes way more sense than whatever gto wizard does and i can get away with it all right
