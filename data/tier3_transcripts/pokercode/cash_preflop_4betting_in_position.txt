### TOPIC: cash preflop 4betting in position
 Today's video is about forebetting in position. For some this might sound like a kind of mysterious tool that you've never seen at the live table without kings or aces but in reality there is much more about it and it's just a mighty tool that you should know about when to use it, with which hands to use it, how to react accordingly to whatever a villain is doing to then master your game in that part of the game tree as well and just yeah be an opponent no one wants to play against first i want to explain the spot that for everyone it is clear what i'm talking about so what happens to get to that four bat spot in position is that we started open raising we did open raise from either early position, middle position, cutoff or button. That doesn't matter for that case and what happens next is that we face a three bet from the blinds. Either the small blind or the big blind. We will have a deeper look at how positions matter there a little later in this video. But yeah first of all the blinds do three bet and now we have a hand that we think about four betting with we can already talk about either value or bluffing or maybe there is something in between we'll learn about all that and this is the spot we are in and now let's discuss how ranges should look like how ranges can look like and how things are played out in reality. Mainly there are two different kinds of ranges that we can be facing so I'll start with the easiest one. This is a linear range. A linear range just means that villain is playing the top x percent of his range and does three bet against us. So this is all he does's no random mixing, we don't need to worry about which hands is he having and which not. It's just the top X percent of his range. This is always happening when someone decides to play 3-bet only, which a lot of people are playing from the small blind. Just to simplify the game tree, not over calling in a position that is just the worst position on the table and then go from there so either take down the pot or play as an aggressor with a strong range and continue from there so when we think about four betting versus a linear range we should know about that well this range is kind of yeah fixed kind of face up right people that are playing three bet only. Small blind versus button that would be something like 15%, small blind versus under the gun in the example I've shown here should be something like 7.5%. So since people actually do not have a choice to make here the ranges are looking pretty much the same for everyone who ever looked at some preflop charts. So it's really the three bet only strategy just shows okay they either play a hand which is the three bet or they don't. So when they've seen a chart before they will take well what they have seen and there's just like they are not deciding do I call this time do a three bet this time not much involved, as you can see in that little example here. And I already wrote down an exploitative thought here that it's very, very usual that people are actually too loose here. In that example I gave you, this is a Zoom 500 rake structure, 6 max, so small blind versus under the gun. You should, for example, 3-bet Ace-Queen offsuit about 50% of the time the other 50% are a fold but it's just so easy to only remember that ace queen off and then you three bet it all the time and then well you might end up just being too loose and therefore probably over folding to four bets thinking ahead already right so maybe you three bet nines and eights a hundred percent because you just can't take folding those but you don't want to open up the calling range you look at ace five suited and you know this is your three betting hand in a way so king ten suited queen ten jack ten all nicely looking hands and this is what happens with the linear range so now we have have the situation we did open race villain three bets a linear range and we have to make up a range that we want to play against that. What should we four bet? Is there value and are there bluffs and how should they look like? So yeah I just in the next slide show you the requirements for each of that. And first to give you a little overview I put the game tree in that slide actually. So you see what can happen next. Look a little ahead in the future. We could be forebetting and what happens next is villain is folding, villain is calling or villain is going all in. And since we only want to make plus cv plays we want to know what our returning streams are where is the money coming from do we hope for villain to fold is he calling how much equity are we having is he going all in what is happening next so now i split it up i don't actually like calling things value and bluffing hands pre-flop because there's always equity involved and a value hand can be doing like okay but not great or it can do really great like pocket aces or there is a bluff which is actually doing fine versus a calling range but in the end hoping for villain to fall so it's like in between right we are not on the river and everything is crystal clear but just for the sake of it i still call it value hands when we hope to get jammed on or just saying that we call it off and the requirements for that are kind of obvious but i want to split it up here to just make things clear we want to have equity versus villains all in range we plan to call off a jam and against that jam we obviously want to do as great as possible so aces will be our best hands whatever villain jams we have the best hand that's the best thing that can happen kings are doing fairly well against any all-in range even if we four bet from under the gun right things are tightened up there but still this is obviously a great hand and maybe something like i don't know pocket nines can be interesting as well but equity versus all in range well actually that's not a value hand we won't call off a jam so we have the second part we should look at equity versus villains calling range and this is something that people do not think about right they they are bluffing they hope for the fold they take their I don't know like jack-9 suited because it feels great and it's just a little too weak to be calling. But in the end, well, if villain is flatting something like pocket queens and pocket jacks, you are really not doing that great. So this is something to take into account very, very certainly. The equity versus villains calls. And now the bluff hands. If that exists, it's like they don't care too much about villain jamming anymore right because then the hand is over so they focus even more on having equity versus villains calls and the second thing is they want to make sure that villain is jamming yeah not as often just like the least amount possible so having blockers to that all in range is very very crucial so we see already that all the hands that are not very very nice for bad call of hands like kings aces ace king and so on are definitely centered around king highs and a size villain will jam lots of kings lots of aces i took the small blind versus under the gun spot here, right? So it's really just tight ranges. Kings, aces matter and that's about it. So what we can see here is actually, well, we have a clear value range that is aces and some weaker part that is not doing that great or just as good as with the call, which already belong to it's not like villain is jamming queens all the time so it's really a tight game from those positions ace king off doing fine but it's really not it's already close and then we have nice additions right hands that are not for bad calling off tens for example pocket knights they can do great versus a calling range if villain ends up calling something like five six suited to crack our aces it's sometimes really great to have something like pocket nines ace jack suited king jack suited having those blockers doing great versus pocket tens pocket nines even if villain is flatting pocket queens, it's really doing great against that. So far so good. This is in the end how a theoretically optimal if that exists, right, or a solver approved four betting strategy looks like. Again, I will mention that a couple of times today. This is all if villain plays a somewhat correct three betting range. Here we are talking about playing versus a linear range. That means we can more or less rely on villain having a certain range. If he is a reg and ever looked at a chart this will be like somewhat the same for everyone. So this will be our main reaction to those type of players. Now let's have a look at another spot that might be actually the more interesting, especially when we get to the exploitative side a little later. And now we stick to four betting in position but we are playing versus the big blind range. I didn't even know how I want to call it because it's not polarized, it's not linear, it's not it's it's just a big mix. Down here you can already have a look at that chart. This is for Zoom 500, the rake structure is solved chart for the big blind vs. button 3 betting range. This is about 14.7% well actually that's pretty precise but you see there's a huge mix of fans. King-8 suited, queen-6 suited, 10-7 suited, even the offsuit broadways like king-jack offsuit stuff like that. So here it's really really tough because villain has another option. Villain has the option to call right he sits there every single time and sees king-jack and his natural will be the call button he sits there with 10-7 suited the natural instinct is the call button right it's a it's a high frequency call than a three bet but you should have it just for board coverage you have all kinds of things to be aggressive to not let the button realize all the equity after open raising and the correct range would be for villain to just play a very very wild mix of things that obviously includes all the strong hands but lots of weak hands as well and well regarding the weak hands this just forces him to play lots of low frequency hands which i can tell you already gets forgotten a lot right if you sit there you just click the call button, if you multi-table and so on. So here I would call that range a very unreliable range. We cannot know what villain is actually playing like. Usually people are too value heavy there. Just think about that spot villain sits there with aces, faces a button open race. What's his instinct? What will he do? He will 3- bet a hundred percent of the time if someone sits there with 10-7 suited and is playing a couple of tables what is happening he clicks on call before he even thinks about the three bet right people are not that aware that like even when they have the chart it's just so easy to oversee that especially when like not focusing on one table so this is something to keep in mind and this is something we need to react to when it comes to forebetting let's have a look now at how our forebetting range is structured against a big blind range and here actually i give you a couple of seconds on purpose to figure out that this is the exact same slide i've shown you that we want to play against the small line range i just gave you another example here because now here in that example we're talking about button versus big blind but the requirements are exactly the same if we think about for betting a value hand we want to do well against villains jams that will include something like kings ace king pocket queens aces and so on so we should do well against that right we see like kings aces ace king suited as the only hundred percent hands here right the others are like yeah ace king jacks obviously we are calling that off in those positions if villain jams but it's not like that we are doing way better than with a call right in the theory world it's same ev all right the bluff hands same thing. It's like equity versus villains calls, blockers to all-in range, and maybe even more important here with wider ranges, an easy fold versus all-in. We don't want to four bet like equity bombs to then just fold. We want to give ourselves easy options here. So it's exactly the same thing. We see that middle part that we are never ever ever for betting and then it's pretty much the bottom end of our calling range is what are our optional for bet bluffs but you can see already there's not like one bluff that is just the one it's a wild mix of things to just yeah have a good board coverage post flop that you can wake up with certain hands villain is not expecting. In reality when people are not knowing you it does not matter whether you have a couple of queen nine suiteds and king seven suiteds and eight nine suiteds or whatever. People won't know. You can just like pick some hands to get to somewhat correct frequencies and then you know these are your hands and play accordingly. Or you go with something like that but randomizing low frequencies is just always very very tough and obviously whenever we have a read we want to play as exploitative as possible to get the maximum out of it and now this is what i want to have a look at next because i spoiled it already hey big blind ranges are special people are probably too value heavy in general and now we want to have a look at how to play against that and why that is the case. So I called this slide actually back to reality because it's very very important I know lots of people that just stick to charts and they talk about yeah button versus big blind this is my four betting range and then they have like 5000 hands on their villain and it's like yeah once you have more information you need to react right four betting is a reaction game because well we open race but that's not the point villain starts off now with a certain three betting range once we know that there's more or less only one correct reaction against that let's say let's do the maximum example right if villain is just three betting aces only hell no i don't want to play that freaking four betting range so then i probably want to set mine everything that's another direction things could be going if villain is so face up and i don't want to four bet anything so that would be like a maximum example if villain is only three betting seven deuce off and never has value hands. Well I want to four bet every single hand probably. So this is just showing that we want to be ready to react once we have more information. But actually because well we are a community and we share thoughts here. It's we have some information already on every every player i made the difference between a linear range and a mixed big blind range already we know how they should look like in theory more or less we can think about what naturally happens to those ranges if people just keep playing and it's just yeah i gave you the example that a linear range is easily too loose if people looked at charts before because well they are actually pretty tight when the calling option is not a thing and now we have those big blind ranges yeah i gave you three i don't know whether it's big enough or not but it's just for the first impression three type of charts for the same spot right so i called the one here the sim city 2022 which is the actual solver like big blind versus button range big mix i don't see that even when playing high stakes i don't see players playing those ranges right the last time i've seen a king 10 off in a three betting range there i don't know probably never queen 10 offsuit no probably not not ever like king six suited yeah maybe at some point but that's about it so this is just not reality and people being looser than that i haven't seen it for example in the zoom 200 pool not a single one so now what is the case is that well top right you can see the i call it aggressive rack that's like people who find the bluffs maybe lacking the off-suit Broadway is something like that they show up with the 10-7 suiteds and so on and maybe they they try to get up to those 14.7 they know the range but sometimes they are just missing out on something right so I call them the aggressive rack and it's just very likely they are still slightly too tight and then what I what I see a, a freaking lot in the, let's say, SUM200 pool maybe, is the, I call it the eight tabling rag, ending up with about 6% 3 betting range there, just having the value hands. But maybe the ace-5 suited as their bluff, the suited connectors, but missing everything else. We are actually against that range. We can fold ace-queen offsuit. We should never have a four bet bluff because where's our fold equity? And this leads us to the questions that we should ask ourselves. First we should know we are in the reaction game. Think about what is villains actual range? How is villains three bet range structured? And then next what can happen next? How much is villain calling versus four bets? And how much is villain calling versus four bets and how much is villain folding versus four bets if we just have a picture of villains range in our mind we can often give a very very good guess and now i think it's very obvious but we get to the exploitative part of of the four betting i showed you already the small blind and the big blind type of ranges that I'm facing on a daily basis I would say. So how I play versus that if there is someone unknown I just make that assumption until I'm proven otherwise. Just like until I'm proven wrong I just try to even be bluff heavy against the small blind. It's very likely that villain is too loose and it's very likely that he is not used to play versus four bats too much because well it's just like a kind of tough bluff to pull and there's just like no way that i'm actually losing doing that and if someone three bats from the big blind i just make the assumption that people are usually too tight for the explained reasons it's just very very tough to be too loose there and this is the one I'm only bluffing versus very, very selected opponents. If I'm really sure that this is like, that they have a somewhat reasonable range. So then I try to evaluate how is their range structure. If people are really crazy and play like somewhat polarized ranges, which means they have a big part that is really bad hands. I don't have a single name in mind who is playing like that. So then I definitely want to 4-bet bluff a lot and I don't need a big sizing. I'm just attacking their air part. I could literally min-click. Another thing is which happens more often is that people are not used to playing versus 4-bets a lot and then they start overfolding a ton. In the video against 4-bets I will talk a little more about why i'm over folding as well because it's just like it's tough to over bluff there with the four bets to find the bluffs again same spot like the big blind three bet aces you will four bet whatever your four bet bluff is you probably clicked call before that so yeah try to have your bluffs against those type of people try to spot them and yeah this is pretty much the first part polarized ranges size down have your bluffs very important then the second thing is size up versus your call happy non-bluffing customer this is how i call them we know they have something if they are not bluffing with the three bet it's not only that we canfold to them, it's when we have it. We can even be super crazy and just 4-bet jam aces. If there is someone sitting playing 13 5 stats with 2% 3-bet and he 3-bets me, I sit there with aces, I know he has kings or queens. There's not much more good happening for me than getting all the money in the middle. So why not just freaking jam even though like every theory would tell you that this is obviously not a good move but this is what I want you to do as well. Exploit to the maximum. So now summarizing that a little again. Try to play reasonable especially against the small bind. Ranges in the small bind if people are playing three bet only. Ranges in the small blind if people are playing three bet only are very very reliable. Everyone is playing somewhat the same ranges so we can react with some kind of strategy that makes sense. Against people from the big blind everyone is very very different while everyone is slightly too tight usually remind yourself that we are playing a reaction game first figure out their range obviously if we have no reads no hands we have to go with some population tendencies with whatever we think all right i gave you the hint probably too tight but if we have some reads play against that we are not playing versus big blind three betting range we are playing versus either 14 12 10 or just five percent or just someone who has aces all the time then we should play against that and really try and exploit him to the maximum once more summarizing everything up for you we should always know that four betting is a reaction game our biggest job is first to figure how villain's three betting range looks like. Is it linear or is it mixed? Very easy. I write that down for every opponent. Once I see the first small blind flat, I write it down. Then this is a different range structure if he's three betting. Same now this is not four betting in position but if someone flats the cutoff or MP, spot where lots of people are playing three bet only write it down. Plays a mixed strategy there so won't be a linear three betting range and then going from there you should build your four betting range. Just like you have your value part and then you can mix in your bluffs if you want to or need to if you decide that you want to have some right so do you play chart poker in the end because he's playing a range that makes sense you want to play a range that makes sense or can you exploit something what is it that you can exploit how do you exploit it you have two parameters you can change your sizing if villain has it you size up and only go for for value. If villain is super polarized, I don't know when that happens, but if you really find a crazy, crazy, crazy player, you should size down. Fight him with the min clicks and see what he does next with his freaking 9-4 suited. So this is very, very important and therefore the key takeaways for the four betting in position and now have fun at the tables don't miss out those fancy bluff four bets especially against the small bind i showed you the hand categories that are important is their calling happening you want to have that equity against it this is where you make the money villain can fold villain can call and then we play in post club with the strongest range possible a four four batting range in position. Have fun and good luck at the tables!
