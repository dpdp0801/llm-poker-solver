### TOPIC: cash preflop advanced
 All right. So I'll just start with the plan for today. So obviously I'll very quickly summarize what should be in the existing videos. Most of you should have seen them about preflop, raising first and defending our big blind. This is our main topic today. And yeah, I'll quickly summarize that, put down some general ideas to go a little further, and then we'll discuss advanced open raising and advanced big blind defense today. Three and four bets because last coachings were always just way too full and I always underestimate the time I need for every topic when I try to interact with the chat. And this is definitely something I want to keep up. So again, feel free to ask any questions regarding the topic, maybe some questions out of the box as well. And I'm happy to answer them whenever possible. So I think this is all we'll get through today. And I keep three and four bats versus different player types for an extra bit. I did not record that yet, but I will do soon. Yeah, wrap things up with the key takeaways as always to let you out there and crush. Yeah, let's just get started. And I think I kept the videos here for preflop as simple as possible. And one main thing that I got lots of questions about is something I will stick to today, which was no charts, no charts. So the quick summary here is for everyone who is really a beginner, you know, Google, Google six max or nine max cash game open raising charts, any reasonable chart you find is pretty good. It's slightly different. Whether some of them open raise king 10 offsuit from the low jack, some mix king jack offsuit, or some even think about folding king queen, it's all fine. Important is that you know your range. Preflop is our foundation for postal. Actually, fuck it, right? Fuck those presentations. Anyways, I'll probably use Paint a lot today. So really, I see it in that way that we are starting to build a little castle, a little house. Take a pen and a paper. This is preflop. This needs to be something solid to then further build on, right? This is the plan. We'll have the flop. We'll have the turn. We'll have the river. R, T, flop and preflop. This is the foundation. Whether that looks a little like that or looks a little like that, the massive important stuff in the middle you won't miss and that will be the same in all charts. Could represent that maybe with a little pocket aces here where all the EVs coming from. We come a little back to that later for sure. And in some examples, the Kings are here. You won't miss them. And like our King 10 offsuit is whether you have like a little extra stone here or not. Right. So this is how you can see it. That's not the moneymaker. No, not at all. So here we need that foundation to build on, to build on a beautiful building because no one would love the pyramids if they would look like that. And this is the same, like if you play perfect preflop, you have a certain baseline to then build on. But if what you build on that is trash, well, no one will remember, or it's like super famous because it's kind of art, but that's a different thing. Cool. So this is kind of the plan. We need a solid foundation and any chart is good. Whether this is a little on the corner like that, some stones more or less, that's fine. Okay. So we learned that already. Preflop is just our foundation. Knowing our range is key. Now you want to build on that. If you don't know yourself what you just did, preflop with your entire range, it sucks. You should always know, do you have offsuit two pairs on that flop? King six deuce. Did you open on the button king six off or didn't you? Three, four, five from the high jack or the low jack. Did you open raise pocket threes, pocket fours, pocket fives? Well, feel free to go. If not, might be a range check, for example. Stuff like that. So now, again, if we want to look that up, and this is the moment i will pull out gto wizard what i mean with ev numbers show ev given perfect this like gto wizard is not perfect but it's getting pretty close perfect play versus perfect play right so in the real world though no one is playing perfectly not me not you not linus no one so actually these charts are not like the absolute reality. They are probably closer to like high stakes games or very good players, but they are not the only reality. They are different for every rake structure. They are different for any deviations that are happening. So now just to show you a couple of things, let's have a look. This is 1KGG rake, right? This is serious. So a hundred big blinds,s cut of open raising range or i talked about the low jack let's look at that king 10 offsuit you see the ev of raise or fold is both zero so what you do doesn't matter queen 10 zero doesn't matter seven six suited zero doesn't matter four three deuces so if you decide to go with them or not go with them, just changes your basement slightly, not your EV in that world, right? So what is important is big rocks in the middle, which is freaking pocket aces, 8.42 big blinds. And what I like is looking at those absolute numbers to really understand what the difference makes. Just imagine one time timing out with pocket aces. If you raise aces under the gun here, on average, you will win 8.42 big blinds if you play perfectly and if everyone else plays perfectly. So if we have edge, we should even win more maybe. And so this is important. And now just think about how often are you allowed to time out with jack-9 suited without any regret compared to that pocket aces? So it should be 421 times. To just get the feeling how irrelevant all those borders are. And this is why I like that representation here. All those borders, small eb. Maybe it adds up a little. Let's say all of those. Everything that is 0.02 or less. King-Jack off, Queen-jack off, king-10 off, queen-10 off, jack-10 off, queen-9 suited, jack-9 suited, 10-8 suited, 9-8 suited, 8-7 suited, and so on. If you add them all together, like I'd say that's like, I don't know how many combinations. Still, all those combinations, each of those timing out 10 times, and you still didn't lose the view of timing out with pocket aces. So really, this is how I want to see it. Really discussing those borders to know like, okay, my game is good now because I got the great preflop chart. And you tell your buddy, hey, but king eight suited is like a 95% open raise from that position in this chart. Doesn't make you any better poker player. Not at all. I get that question so freaking often, right? If you sit down and tell me like i play freaking what is that this is 18.5 percent if you tell me you play 13 and you know exactly what you play well we can do that as well this is 13 if you tell me this is my range and you know it right probably we should change that a little and kill the queen jack offsuit add some more suited stuff but you know exactly what it is i think it's like a better foundation in the end if you know it right instead of being like i have this 50 20 the implications for post flop are the key here but isn't that where the edge is gained easy to rfi top range money doesn't come from ace ace versus kings is what julian used to say yes that's right everyone plays that, but it's important to play your range correctly post-flop. This is important to evaluate whether you hit a board or not. And this is way easier when you may keep your game simple. Right? Just hear that example. How good is this guy doing on a board of like 3-4-5? I don't know. Right? In my spot, let's say the super tight guy who's maybe a beginner in poker, he knows 3, 4, 5. I don't have those pockets. That's shit. This knowledge is the key, which will give you a right post-flop strategy, which we could run it in PIO without all those sets and maybe not 6, 7 suited. You're checking back 100%. This is kind of the point. You're not in like a given surrounding in like fixed strategy. You're not giving anything away. Obviously, people can just overfold versus you if you're too nitty. But this is a point where we get to when you play on a more regular basis against other players. This is the main understanding first, that it doesn't matter whether you open raise Queen Jack off 0%, 100% or 50% of the time, the moment you sit down at the table. Okay, let's keep going. So this was the explanation for why any chart you find is good. Now, the second point is, or the third point actually here, is that the EV numbers show EV given perfect play versus perfect play. And this is now where things start. We need to evaluate. And usually we over-evaluate our skill level and are very, very easy with calling anyone else a fish. I can show you hands that you should mark and mark me as a fish just because maybe it was a big exploit or maybe I just didn't know the spot or whatever. Actually, it's a cool thing to call everyone a fish because it's kind of right. But we are fish ourselves. So we mess up all the time time and now that evaluation is the absolute key because it allows you hey how would the ev of this zero ev queen jack look like if you are a beginner and in the big blind the earth's line is love i would doubt that queen jack off has zero ev for you it has zero ev gto wizard versus gto wizard but someone who just learned the rules against the or one of the best players in the world will be massively minus cv let's say i play high stakes Thanks for watching. wizard versus gto wizard but someone who just learned the rules against the or one of the best players in the world will be massively minus heavy let's say i play high stakes because of a very big spot i know i'm not studying every day right now i have not that much time to invest in poker like players who do that 24 7 so this is the reason i'm clearly worse than them i need to accept it but my seat can still be good if there is a big recreational who wants to blow away money. So if there is Linus in the big blind, I accept that. And I'm just way tighter from the button, for example, right? I will not play race first in with a, let's say a GTO strategy if I'm not starting limping and do that shit against him, right? It's like, if I do won't be raising 43 maybe I just do 38 right and I say like king eight off I know it's zero against Linus it's not zero and my line is maybe even I could say like ace four off probably just let it go check for suited easy fold and it's correct but what if villain perceives us to have it this is now this loophole of like he thinks that I think that he thinks that like what do we know what he perceives he sits down at the table and has no clue either right so really everyone is a fish maybe he perceives something if we start getting reads that's different but this is our starting point right the range as a starting point that we can study off table and i want you to have the right understanding for why any chart is good and for what those absolute numbers mean. That actually, if I play that, like this is pretty much if we play a drill, this is how much EV I'm giving up against the best player. Best GTO wizard player, let's say, that is not adjusting. But if villain is adjusting, then I can obviously lose more because I'm open to some exploits. Right, exactly. We can own range but we cannot know the perception of others like maybe they're not even paying attention or they've never seen our name even though we played 10 times or like you never know okay so this as a summary already took me way longer than i thought but i think i included a little something that is coming up next general ideas absolute ev numbers i've just talked about that. In GTO Wizard or in PIO, it's the same. Tell us that a lot of decisions are close or even indifferent. This is the starting point. So what we do with them, let's be honest, doesn't matter. Second point, we need to evaluate skill level and include that. If we are better than our opponents, probably we make money with hands that are zero EV in GTO wizard, or even slightly minus EV, and win more money with plus EV hands, like easily said. If we know Willem's tendencies, certain hand types will make more money, certain hand types will make less money, right? Depending on what they need. Do they need fold equity? Well, if someone is overfolding, we make a lot of money. If someone is not folding at all, probably we start losing even though we might have a skill advantage. So now what we need to understand is really villains deviations from solver poker. Point number one, we know no one is playing like that. If we race like that, we know not a single player in this world has this three bet strategy. Not frequencies right, not exact those hand types, even though this would be the perfect reaction to our open race size that's what gto wizard says more or less right so no one has that we can see maybe look a little into the future and no villains deviations this is not the point where we need to have knowledge right this is something if we know that but it can be population tendencies can be like just, right? Just understanding this year and then knowing what we've never seen. Like let's say, I don't know, can't speak for lower stakes that much, but I haven't seen too many like 10-4 suited three bats on NL10 lately, right? So maybe this is just not in their range. Maybe it's like not too much of that part either. Maybe it's not the ace-two's off too much. Right now, my guess is that they are not having 19% and they are way value heavier than that, which would change quite a lot of things. All right, let's say they are not raising 19%. They raised 12% instead. What incentives does that give us? That's a good question for the chat. I'm saying villain is not raising 19% against against my open race he's raising or she's raising 12 instead with a value heavy range so he's lacking those bluffs vpip more we have more equity so we can open weaker hands will exactly right very very very easy okay right would be the one thing let's nail it down to one hand eight nine office. 8-9 off is a hand that every time we race, we'll have three bets, we fold it and just waste the three big blinds or 2.5 big blinds. We have the small one in the middle already. Now, 6% less or 7% less than it should happen. He's three betting now, right? So just 6%, 7% of the time that I'm not losing 2.5 big lines and see a flop where I can realize equity instead. So this number, this incentivization needs to go up. It has to go up. It has to be if I don't mess up post-flop obviously, right? Again, hypothesis that we keep on playing perfect post-flop, still lots of ifs whether that is the case. Here, Jerome coming the next one score bet with no bluffs and bigger obviously this is the next implication villain is three betting and is missing this part what will happen next if we four bet we lack fold equity those 40 fold equity that we have even though let's say villain plays every hand he did three bet perfectly from that point on if he doesn't have that hand he might have way less than this fold equity so our bluffs again what changes a hand that is zero ev like queen jack offsuit will be minus cv instead because it relies on the full equity here on the other hand a hand like pocket aces gain cv right it's It's not facing as many will stack off pretty often if villain just always has it more or less so actually this cv is going up so i really like to read that as a chart i'll show you in excel in a second over fold the shit out of it versus three bets next thing villain three bets i think about calling seven eight suited is zero ev if villain is too Titan value heavy, probably that gets minus EV. King 108 suited is 0 EV. If villain is too tight and value heavy, probably that gets minus EV. King 10 off probably gets minus EV. Maybe though some hand classes like pocket peers that are more or less set mining are more guaranteed to get payoff when they hit. So actually the EV number of those peers might go up. I don't say against the biggest knit in the world. I think I win more than 0.27 big blinds. I make a set, I win a stack. That's the plan. Deep into mortar has a good point. 8-7 suited less dominated by the bluffs he's supposed to have though no. So EV might go up a bit. This is why I switched to the pocket peers because they are I'm sure 7-8 suited does okay against the value part but obviously obviously will have less equity overall if it mainly faces over pairs. But I'm not sure. The deuce is threes, fours. I'm very, very sure that, well, instead of playing against bluffs that have 50% equity, we play against hands where we have a very, very clear plan. Okay. So now what is important for us to get better in that spot? There is no golden book. There is no rule. There is no nothing because it's the constant evaluation. Not correct. Correct is not possible, but as good as possible. Evaluating as good as possible, both villains and heroes skill or not just skill. It's like what is happening with which hand classes, how are people playing? That will lead to the huge adjustments where the money is made in the end example gto is that i don't forget but i showed you a little around here already all right so now let's get to the open raising all right so what i want to do here is really we see villain strategies as a given thing as a fixed thing firsthand we sit down not they know us they have a perceived of whatever last time we bluffed them and so on we kill that we sit down first hand they don't know our name so really this is what it is we have kind of that chart in our mind like those numbers those absolute numbers we know exactly if they play like this this is our ev and that won't change they are not adjusting and now i want to understand the incentivization for our strategy. So I can say they are doing something wrong and often we can say that. My example was they are not three betting the big blind often enough. This is backed up by all data in the world because it's just a natural thing to not do that correctly. If you never looked at a chart, you won't think about three betting king, eight offsuit. So this was a very natural thing, but this exists. And there are maybe some over accurate people where things will change. So we need to understand incentivization. Again, I think of that like that, that we have a certain baseline. And let's just say if we go into like two directions, this year is the open raise higher frequency. And this year is the open raise lower frequency side. Whatever we'll find will pull us in one direction. So now we have started with the big blind is not three betting enough so that was a clear plan. It will pull us in that direction. On the other side it could be okay next the forebet, it would have been in that direction, right? So for forebetting, it would have been that. So this year, maybe open raise higher frequency. So maybe what could be another thing is that the villain is incredibly aggressively raising the flop. I make that one up. No one is doing that, right? This would even have implications for preflop. If he raises me on every flop, my weakest hands that are not flopping well, or hands that need five parts, like draws and weak gut shots and stuff, you know, where we often make hands on the turn and river, not before, they get less interesting, right? Maybe there's like incentivizations for everything. Maybe villain is obviously over-aggressive pre-flop, then it would be in that direction. If there are more players involved in more spots, we'll often end up with like something like that. Two arrows pulling us in one direction, one in the other. This is kind of what I have in my head when I really think about, okay, the fish on the table, right? Where really people are playing off the chart. What are they doing? What is this guy doing? If I play like in a 5k plus and people play very, very similar ranges, right? In the open raising spots, I would say. But if there is one guy who's just ready to blast off, well, how is everyone changing? Then things get interesting. Okay. And now understand the incentivization, two parameters, one parameter. And what I mean with that is that usually we talk about frequency because it's more or less a thing that we are not changing the sizing. The sizing change is something villain can see. We don't want him to know that we are exploiting right now. A frequency change is something he cannot see. Even after like 500 hands, he won't know that we are just open raising lighter on the button when he's in the big blind. There's just no chance. Like he will never find out. The only way he finds out is if he sees us with like king four offsuit on the showdown. Might happen, but not that often. Showdowns are a rare thing in poker. So this is why I think like two parameters, but actually it's one parameter. And if we want to combine those, even we could say money invested, right? That's like, okay, we want to invest more money on average because we have more full equity that is mainly the frequency but yeah this is what i mean here frequency is easy and always the standard thing and now we can really think about new ev numbers for each hand let's just say these are the ev numbers of gto wizard something like that right i can add in some more like some good hands that this the V here. And I might get like green and red, something like that. And here's like even worse. We are losing a lot here. And here we are losing a little more. And now I have one read that changes everything where I just did this year. And this is a copy paste of the upper one. And I just added like plus 0.15 because I said this guy's shit post-flop in whatever way. So any hand I'm playing is more interesting. Or I can just say he overfolds pre-flop by this amount and this is the extra money I'm making just because of that. Actually, that would decrease the value of aces. But here we are thinking about the zero EV hands. And usually if it unfolds more, this is something we are doing. This here is obviously last row that doesn't exist. So now I change one thing. And this is what I mean with that. We change the frequency. We put in the incentivization. And this is the image I have in my head now that, okay, like this is when we talk about, or Fedor does that as well. We go one pip wider, two pips wider, because now this here should be the same hand, those two here, right? From minus 0.05, this just turned out to be a plus 0.1 because of something Willem does. Okay, let me read the chat a little on the side. I usually start with the baseline and only think, should I play more? The table incentivizes me to play less, which implies strong players there. It is a clue to switch table. Very good point. Maybe one thing you're missing, there might be very, very bad players that might be overly aggressive just putting in. Let's say behind you, there's someone who just jams any two 400 bigs. You don't want to leave that table, but at the same time, you don't want to open raise queen 10 offsuit from anywhere. That's all. It's extreme example, obviously, but something like that, someone overly aggressive just forces you to, well, be in it and wait for it. So really, sometimes there can be a nit and wait for it so really sometimes there can be a reason to play tighter as well or it's a spot where the table is really really good because you have two big whales to your right but right now you're first in on the button and you play against two good wrecks in the small one in the big blind you know what i mean here too i can make examples where you shouldn't leave the table but it's up for a discussion to tighten up a little Okay, this Excel, I hope that it's clear what I mean with that, right? Really here, imagine new EV numbers in the given situation for your hand. And then the sizing, think about where the EV comes from in the end. If there is a super whale, yes, please, for sure, change the sizing as well. It's like, I know this part, like I open race, biggest knit in the world, three bets from the big blind. I have one sizing with aces and this is the all in button. He won't fold jacks, not ace king. Because of his three bets, he won't three bet jacks to then fold. So that would be something. Cool. Now I think next slide, I prepared a little example. I'm not sure, maybe one more slide. Maybe it's an example. It's the example. Okay. So I got one example for you where I wanted you to do that on the go, or just let me know in the chat and think about incentivization. So really think about what are you incentivized to change your strategy? This is a random GTO wizard drill to have a picture that you know the situation better. King five of hearts doesn't matter, right? So our hand doesn't matter. We are playing blind if he actually wants so. But we talk about our full range? So now the example is the following. We are in the cutoff and we think about raising first in. The button is a recreational. We know that and placed 25-1 so far on like a somewhat medium significant sample. The small blind though is very, very aggressive and plays 32-23 with a 13% 3 bet. And the big blind is an unknown player for tabling, which we should guess he's kind of a wreck. All right. There are pretty much three infos you have. You have an info about the button, an info about the small blind, and an info about the big blind. I want you to tell me like pretty much lower two, lower three. I just make an example in the chat, right? This would be just that three things give you incentivizations this is obviously an incorrect answer right whether you want to up your frequency and then you write like up or down or higher or you want to like lower your open raising frequency how are you adjusting in that spot or like even you can like plus plus or minus minus to give it some strength it's like plus plus plus plus plus if something's very strong all right tucker got the first one in here higher lower normal julian's wine bottle ups that by one seems like a reasonable answer miguel is saying one here we go one plus plus two plus plus three minus minus deep into mortar maybe double check what one two and three are Jerome gives a full answer. I'd open wider with plan of four betting small blind if you three bets. One up, two up, three normal. Okay. Jason lower for all. More ace, ax, king, ax, lower suited connector, pocket pairs normal. I mean, we are in the cutoff. We are open raising every pocket pair. Okay. So now let's think about the first things. I didn't expect that many different answers. Cool, plus one for button because they won't be three betting enough. Minus two for small blind for a very high three. Plus one for big blind. So now we're thinking about open raising. So which means at the same time, we are not talking about aces here. We are talking about a hand that is zero EV and GTO wizard more or less, or slightly minus. So this is our spot. We are having king nine offsuit right now now pretty much. We're ace-five. We're jack-seven or maybe pocket threes if you want so but no way I'm folding pocket threes in the cutoff. So now what is happening? The button plays 25-1 which first of all means he's absolute dogshit. He's not three betting and if he's three betting we know his hand. This has to be good for us. He's not vpiping the amount he should so he's over-folding. If he is VP IPing, well, we just said we have a hand that folds to a three bet, like king nine offsuit. Well, then this has to be good. So that's like at least one plus, if not two pluses, if not three pluses, right? It's like, we can just say he's not participating in the hand pretty much and just play a button range. That's pretty much my starting point here, right? Because I have direct implications because I don't need to fold to his three bets because they don't exist. I see the flop more often if he VPI piece, but most of the time he just folds more than he should. That's great things. The second thing I could add is if someone plays 25-1, hell yeah, I need to have incredible post-flop edge. There's no point that this is not the case. So that just means I want to play more hands. Just because of that point, I'm close to a button range here. All right. Now the small line seems very aggressive. And now here, which I see where Jerome is coming from, who said like he's wider because of that, because he then can four bet. But now we have the problem that I didn't give you any information. Maybe it's the guy who just three bet, five bet jams and your four bets are minus EV. I didn't say he over folds to four bets maybe that's likely maybe not right maybe the money is coming from light four bats for value just four betting tends to let him rip in ace five suited every time right so maybe right but actually 32 23 13 is not too crazy it's just like two pips too wide compared to a good high stakes player so it's just slightly slightly too slightly too aggressive. This is like the style that Doug Polk plays in videos if he like plays NL2K or so. Where like he just says, I'm like a little too wide and it's fine. The big blind is an unknown player for tabling, just a random rack. You can keep it neutral or as a little plus, because we discussed that every single time depends on stakes that yeah, most likely they are not three betting enough big blind versus cutoff right so we can just double check that to put in a little population tendency this is what he should three bet do we see those queen four suited king five suited see do we see 10 do we see king 10 offsuit i would probably say no and we rather see six percent that would be slight slight slight plus but the button here is a huge huge huge plus i would end up with a slight increase in my range, not play a button range because of the small blind, but play like a very, very loose cutoff range, like in a 35 to 37% region if I need to nail down a number. But this is then guessing game, obviously. Oh, I thought one, two, three are all present. Yes, they are all present and I want to evaluate them separately, right? One by one and then come to an absolute conclusion. Should not change versus small wine and GTO scenario because our formats make up versus... Yeah, June's wine bottle, I explained that. I'm not sure about the formats. I didn't give any further information. That's a random guess, pretty much. Cool. So now this is now how I want you to think, to get better. It's so easy to just follow a chart, but there are so much more and I hope you experienced that right now, right? What we can think about, knowing where the EV comes from. We know how often people fold, how often we realize equity and so on. I meant that he basically exploits. The point is, he's maybe playing like this and adds 9-8 suited, ace-7 suited and has ace check off 100%. That would be almost enough for explaining those stats long-term. It's not like I put down like a 58-42 guy. This might be a very, very good player. And this is the understanding where the EV comes from. The EV comes from the button not being present. It's like we're not finding the best player on the table to fight him. Kind of a very easy point to see it. Yes, but we exploit him more if we just fold all the hands that aren't playing back against the forward. Exactly. We are trying to pre-exploit him because we assume his next action, but not his next next. Absolutely. If I give you information about he 3-bets very wide, but falls to 4-bets because he has the population tendency that people are value heavy with 4-bets, then I'm a hundred percent with you. But I didn't give that information. Okay. So I got one more example. Here we found a little up and down. Now I think the next one is actually the easier one. Let's just see this one. We are on the button and think about raising first hand. Again, we don't have queen eight suited. You can imagine we have queen eight offsuit. Two things we know. We have seen the small blind flat ace queen offsuit versus our button open in the last orbit. All right, so this is now the first thing. We have seen that, which is very typical to like a life table, let's say. We've seen one hand. I don't give you any stats, whatever. And the big blind over called in the same spot with king three offsuit, last orbit, and open folded top here on the turn. No clue how we found out all that, that they all showed their hands, but this is what we know now. What's the plan? And actually, I want you to break it down again. It's very easy that we will be wider here. But I gave you three reads. So if you want to give me the perfect answer, you tell me the three reads I gave you, what they mean, and you tell me what each of those mean. First thing, correct. We are over-realizing equity versus under a three bet from the small blind. All right. Now we get the idea of sizing up. Very interesting. So Julian's Wine Bottle brought that up and OMG Kai Rudi supports that, but he wouldn't change his range too much we're mostly safe from three betting so we can play a bigger sing race but in position he actually says under three bet from the small one all figured that out right and lots of fold equity posts from the big blind tucker comes with one much higher rfi as see more flops so we see way more flops obviously too much higher again as call way too much and overfolds post flop overly realizing equity post post flop by just betting anything. We're so already. Now, if I ask you, where's the money coming from? What is our main focus? What is our main thing we want to focus on? Where's our money coming from? It's already in this list, what you wrote down. I just want you to point it out again. Okay. And now you're right. Forget about realizing equity and so on and under three betting. Now explain to my mom who doesn't know the poker rules what the plan is in one sentence. No poker words allowed. I mean, some poker words, but not like equity realization and bullshit. Laugh a lot. Start earlier. You got the second part of the sentence right. Here we go. Jason L. Here we go. Raise bigger. We want to build a big pot. We know this guy is over defending. This king three offsuit with a small blind flat is a horrible call. Like he's investing way too much money pre-flop. We'll never have something post-flop. And now we even know that this guy freaking, let's not simplify, that he even folds his freaking top pair on the turn. So now villainous calling. The ace queen off call is actually not out of this world if you want to play with a calling range. So actually, this is something that was more of a trap. It's very likely that he is under three betting, but it's not changing the EV significantly. It just allows us to use a bigger open race size. That's pretty good. But he calls and here we have seen freaking king three offsuit. This is so much out of this world that over call, he calls that to then freaking fold the top pair. So now the sentence I would give my mom is just build a huge pot pre-flop right just open raise big and then take down the pot by betting once twice three times i don't care keep the money flowing play more and play so and i would play more hands any hand we are playing this guy is calling three big lines four big lines pre-flop too wide with like random hands and then we win post-flop all right i hope that was clear right now here. The ace queen was kind of a trap because it's not changing EV. It's like a little hint in which direction it goes. But every one of you started with that. Important is to understand where the money is coming from. So again, when we go, this is now a Hiyatsu area. When we are sitting on the table, we want to know that where is our spot? Where's the money coming from? If you have this one guy, this big blind and you sit down in this spot or even any spot, you can probably three bet him if you are on his direct left and stuff and do the same shit with him. Just if you know, I build a big pot, I take it down. Probably the guy who doesn't care whether you bet like half pot or 75, you can even have like a perfect risk reward, right? He's just scared. He sees other showdowns where people always have good hands somehow. Well, you can muck if you bluff. That's fine. Lucky me, I had it down at like only two examples, but I liked them a lot. So just pointing out how much we have to think about stuff. And here is still think we heavy GU rivers versus big blind. Give up. Well, we don't know if he just loves folding. I would say if he calls the turn, he has a hand. So we need on the river a change. Like if a flush gets here or something, right? All the straights in the world. I would just see that as scared so far. But again, Julian, you're right because we have a turn information, no river information so far. Sounds good. Just pumping money in. Okay. At the same time, if small blind calls, we shut down. He plays a reasonable tight range probably. Okay. So far, open raising. You can train that. Screenshot your next table. I show you once how game details, stakes. Let's hunt Zoom 500 to have some reads on the guys. And show HUD, right? This is just what you can do if you have stats. Obviously, you can't do that with GG poker. There's more other knowledge. So now we can see one of the things is positional raise first in, the second lowest line. Yeah, this will be big blind defense, but now first in, yeah, sorry, we're first in, I'm a little too fast here. Where would you know something, right? This Asian invasion guy, big blind versus small blind, three batting, 20. That's good. So we play like GTO right now, right? This guy, evil smile, very good player as well. Oh, has big blind versus small blind, nine. Maybe he misses something on 8,400 hands I have. Ooh, maybe against him we want to be a little wider. And this guy, 200 hands doesn't tell us much. 3,000 hands. What about this guy? Big blind versus small blind seems reasonable. So nothing here, right? So now it would be how much do they defend and so on. But here, again, we found EvilSmile, not 3-betting the big blind. There, small blind versus in, we can be wider. and everything else seems reasonable 23 17 29 24 24 20 21 18 maybe a little tight here 24 21 so all wrecks that's the table you want to leave that's okay on gg you need to see whether people call king three off this is why i gave you a freaking example without stats all right so paying attention making notes you don't stats. This is actually the bigger information having seen this king three offsuit once. All right. Advanced pick blind defense. Actually, what we tried with open raising was reacting to something that will happen in the future that we know already, which is tough, right? If we do something, villains turns after us if we open raise. So actually they could re-explode, do stuff and so on. Here, now we're reacting to existing information. That's a different thing. Now, when we open raise, we evaluate what will happen in the future. How will they react to our open raise? What are they doing? But we still can do that. Like preflop is very fixed. People are not changing that much. Here we know, okay, what's going on. Reaction game. This guy's open raising and our next point is defend versus range, not versus position. I don't want to know whether he's from the hijack or the cutoff if I have better information. I want to know whether he plays 20%, whether he plays 15%, or 45%. Whether I defend against a range that includes pocket deuces, threes, fours, or not. And again, even more, I know exactly who I'm playing against. I can evaluate post-flop edge. Where does the money come from? Is he super aggressive? Do I want to flop something? Is he super passive? Do I always see five cards and can just chase straight draws and stuff? And what I'm looking out for is zero equity EV. I want to talk like very briefly about that. Okay, first point, pretty much referring to the reaction game and defend versus range. The more info we have about villains opening range, the better we can evaluate. So here I gave you another screenshot of a Zoom 500 table. Again, as you can imagine, it's a shit table, but I've given you like in red here, you see the positional first in, and we have someone reasonable 1917. Obviously he is not looser from under the gun than from the hijack. This will just be variants where lots of four handed five handed tables, but you see, it's like a pattern. Cutoff seems a little tight, but still maybe the cutoff is 27 in reality and that's all fine. Here's 6,000 hands. There shouldn't be much variance. He's very tight. 15 from the low jack, 18. This is tighter than GTO wither. 23 from the cutoff is really freaking knit. 38 from the button, another freaking knit and then actually two loose from the small blind. So now, again, this is the perfect example. This psycho aggro moron. I don't know. Perfect example because against him, I don't want to mark him as a knit. I want to play against his cutoff. Pretty tight for playing against the cutoff. But if he open raises the small blind, I want to be aggressor. He's the best out-of-position player in the pool. Probably, yes. So this is something that we can see. So really, if we have information, we want to have that. Again, for GG or live casino, seeing hands. If someone open folded, that's the best old man like to open fold. That's good. Write down the info. If you see a showdown and someone was there, I don't know, with king four offsuit from the button, you know that he has more than 50% open race. So, and this obviously for cash, obviously for cash for tournament everything all right you just need to compare it to the existing charts that you know what would be right more or less all right so really focus on that there's this given thing the position is only a hint for the range he's playing if you have further information use that information cool the more we know about villain's future game the more we can deviate from chart poker chart poker as well. So now what I'm doing is here, when I put it in the GGO wizard, if villain open raises under the gun, I don't give a shit. If I put it under the gun here, it means the open raise is like 18%. Let's say this guy open raise 18 from MP. Perfect. This is his MP range. Now I look at it, but I take this and I don't care that this is under the gun and there it's hijacked. Or I cut off here, it's 30. He plays 23. Hell no, I'm looking at that. I'm looking at that. Here we go. It's just one position too tight every single time. And on the button, I need to be a little flexible with that. And on the small line, I don't even know what I should do. I'd run my own sim maybe. In a live tournament, how many times do you have to see it before you deem it a verified pattern? Open raising just once. Big blind defense just once. I need the explanation. What did he think? If there is a big whale involved, it's not worth information. But just that it's way wider. Like for example, I know one read maybe is like Alex Foxen hunts the spot at the table. If there's the spot in the big blind, he takes every freaking A7 offsuit from under the gun. He just wants to play with the spot and tries hard. So his ranges will be crazy. But obviously, if there's no spot in the big line, he just plays a very reasonable good range. It's really just maximum exploitation there. Okay, so now you see how I would do it here. It's information. And now what we could add is future game. What do we know about this guy's future game? Actually, here, I don't know, right? I can't click on it. Not much. I don't even know right now what those numbers mean not much i just think he's overall a little nitty but then a solid post-flop player i even forgot what those numbers mean he said c-bet fold to c-bet raise c-bet i think 60 c-bet so not that c-bet heavies but all good players nothing so i stick a little to the chart but to the chart that fits to their race first in again hi, Hiyatsu supports me here. Leave that table, play something else, have a spot where you know what you're going to do. Here's everyone trying to play close to the book, hoping to win by playing slightly better. In the end, stars is winning and like the break and no one's really winning. Okay. So now what I mean with look for spots where you know the EV is coming from, I mean this here, zero equity spots. And before showing you, maybe I used that in a video already. I don't know. Does anyone know what I mean with zero equity EV? Give it a shot. If not, that's fine. I think what is zero EV in theory, but it's plus EV versus specific guy, EV of pure bluffs. Nope. It's zero equity EV. It's not the zero EV. It's just meaning that we could create EV without even having hands, without even having cards, just as like a auto profit by making them fold. Pretty much that's it. You have two jokers. You can't even use your hand. You can't even show it down, but this is the EV you can create even without having a real hand. So it's not where we need to have a gut shot or some equity or anything. We're like, usually we are not having zero, zero equity bluffs on the turn. We only have that on the river, but here I'm talking about any spot, right? So it's just knowledge you have about villain in a certain line where he's like clearly overfolding and you can actually quantify that, right? So now I'll give you an example. Zero equity EV is the EV you can realize no matter your hand. I know this is lots of texts. I will go through it pretty quickly. On low stakes, most villains overfold after showing weakness or just by not showing any interest in the pot, right? So the example I make here is that we know, this is now knowledge. Villain checks back 30% of the time. And when he does, he folds 65% of his range versus a 75% turn back. Exactly. He could not reach his minimum defense frequency, so we could have jokers. Absolutely, that's the explanation. So now I just quickly did the math, right? Villain checks back flop, happens 30% of the time. Here, my example, we have a pot size of 5.5 big lines. Villain folds the turn versus our 75% sizing, which obviously needs less than 50% fold equity, but we have 65, and we could just do the math here and actually win 11.6% of this pot or just 0.639 big minds. If this is a given thing over all boards, obviously some people will overfold some boards a ton, some others not at all, but that will average out if we just like, maybe even we can have that better. And now this would be an extreme example where if that is the case, but no braces, we think about defending and we have a hand like seven deuce off, which in theory loses 0.49. But we know we have one certain line that we know how often it happens that this is enough to defend an H2. It's an extreme example. Villain checking back fairly often, 30% check back for being so incredibly unbalanced on the turn. So let's just double check that line. We get a random board. Oh, this is not 0 EV. If you have a 7, let's take this board. Check. Villain checks back 30%. He should check back even more. That is a wild check back range. Okay. And the turn is a freaking 3. So we have absolute massive 0 EV. And now we take a sizing we should never take really this one here. And we'll emphasize to fold 65%, which well, shouldn't be the case, especially not if we have seven dues, but just, I don't, I'm not saying I want to defend seven dues here, right? It would be quite obvious if someone sees that and stops folding, but mainly it means not that they play the turn that incorrectly. It's just that they bet every time when they have something on the flop and check back King Queen and fold it now. All right. Minimal flops, you had extreme high fold to probe defend big line N2. Exactly right. And now we can find lots of those spots. I'll give you one last example here. This is a file I did in 2013, I think for Zoom 500. And what I did is I put down the EV for each of the lines when I'm button versus big line in position. This is the old file I found here. Actually, I renamed the example I'm using here. This is some electric pennard. I don't know whether you've heard of that guy. He was the biggest freaking nit in the pool. He played like 20 slash 14. And those were the stats where fold to flop to flop c-bet. Fold versus c-bet 52. On average, it's obviously way, way, way too high. Fold versus turn c-bet, not that high. Okay, fold versus reverse c-bet, 47. Again, kind of too high. Fold versus delayed bet, 76. So now you could decide whether you want to see that or you want to check back and then delay that where now the importance that is how often does he stab probe on the turn? 28%. So 72% of the times he checks again to then fold just everything, right? So we have here the EV of, or is it just the bet is not here somehow. This year is just the EV of the check back and bet. And this is talking about the Zoom 500. I was min raising back in the days. This is in dollars and the pot size is $22.50. All right. So now you win half of the pot with your zero equity and you just know the numbers, right? You can pull that down, make aliases to have like population tendencies. Exactly, right? So he actually just adds to decide CBAT versus delay CBAT when both are overfolded. Well, when you CBAT, you build a pot, you have a chance to do more. So when you have like any kind of equity, it's better to bet right away, right? If you have equity against something that is calling. It might be a bottom pair that might have a two-outer and so on. And the full trash, you keep for later. Okay, this was just a last little fun example. That's it. Let's actually get to the key takeaways. We learned again, any chart is a solid start. And now what was the big point today is the evaluation of villain's play is key. When we think about open raising, we look a little into the future of what is happening and think about those incentives that pull us in like either direction. And yeah, that's mainly it to make an absolute decision. While it's important to keep the focus on the incentive where actually the money is coming from. The king three off big blind guy folding top pair on the turn. That's the money, not the small blind ace queen flat. All right. We need to understand those incentivizations to exploit. All right. I gave you examples and we came up with different frequencies, even in different directions you wanted to deviate where I think it's pretty clear that only one thing was correct. And then the second example, we came up with a sizing plan, right? Changing the sizing, which is something I'm only doing if it's really like giving me huge big time EV, because sizing is something everyone on the table sees. And you want them to play like this and like not even realize. You don't want to wake them up when they play shit all the time. So this is it. And then the big blind defending we learned again, this was from last time as well. We defend versus the range, not versus the position. And we can add zero equity EV. Over folding spots where it's easy to get to, or we know how often we get to. Even with the high rake, I'm defending obviously too wide when I play an L10 because I know they check back too often and then fold the river if they didn't show interest. That's enough. Let them see that 70% on the flop, delayed bet another 40%. That's like 12% total if my quick math was correct, that I see the river and can put out a profitable bet with any two. Okay. Let's wrap it up here. The problem is that this isn't really constrained, slippery slope. Yeah. This is where we need to be honest. If we are shit, we want to stay tighter, right? We need the hands. The hands need to win for us, not the spots. Like being shit is a relative thing. On some playbills, we are great. On some tables, we are shit. And this is different for everyone. I'm great on some tables and I'm very, very shit. I'm a very shit player on some other tables or just some spots. It can happen on the same table, as I said, because of the biggest whale of all times and sit on a 100K and play with the best in the world who studied nothing else for the last five years. Well, I'm a huge underdog against those. So whenever the big spot is out of the hand, I'm out of there, right? Like I'm giving up the plus 0.05 to the Linus Lapis of the world, but I take my plus 8.8 big blind race with pocket aces. Maybe it's only plus 7.5 against them. Who knows? All right, cool. I hope you enjoyed that. As always, feel free to start discussions in the Discord. Give me feedback for how you like the coaching. See you for the next one.
