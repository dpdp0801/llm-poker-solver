### TOPIC: cash preflop big blind defense exploits
 Now let's talk about the potential exploits we can go for preflop when we think about defending the big blind. Remember, we have a two-step system now how to build our defending ranges. First, we build that defending range without splitting it up. We focus on the weakest hands that we can call profitably or play profitably if we want to three bet them. And then second, we think about that split. Which hands do we want to three bet? Which hands do we want to call? And now let's talk about the exploits given those steps. When should we start to exploit? The first fact is that most of the time we are just facing one open raiser. That means there is just one opponent. Once we have information on him, we should start exploiting. It is not anymore like open raising under the gun, having five people behind you, where while it is tough even though you might have reads on one or two of them to really deviate, now we are actually heads up. We are playing one specific player. So if we know anything, let's go make use of that Maybe remember the general approach my three questions What would be right? We have our baseline What is villain doing wrong? What is the right exploit? Now first step is about building our defending range So it is about how why do we want to defend? Thank you. now first step is about building our defending range so it is about how wide do we want to defend we might adjust in two directions one is we can be tighter that can be an exploit in a way as well if we are weaker than villain we can just defend tighter if I get to play versus the best player in the world, I might just fold those hands that are close, knowing that he has edge postflop and they will be minus EV in that specific spot for me personally against that villain. But we're obviously focusing more on the other side where we have the edge. And something I want to focus on especially is a thing I call zero equity EV. So first of all when we have skill advantage that gives us us incentive to widen our defending range. I like to always have a plan where my skill advantage comes from because it's easy to get overconfident and just say we are better. What I mean with that zero equity EV is nothing else but I know a spot where i can create ev no matter what my hand is i don't even need equity in a way so that could be something like if i check call the flop the turn goes check check i know that villain is a knit and over folds to rivers perfect that might be something like when villain is checking back twice and then i'm betting i know he's over folding my hand does not matter right i know this can happen and this is the spot where i create that extra v this where my edge comes from it could be he's c-betting very very wide and then overfalls to check raises. Maybe we don't want to check raise with zero EV but still gives me an idea of how I can exploit post flop which gives me the extra EV thinking about the big blind defense pre-flop. So this is all about step one especially about widening our defending range. Remember so far we didn't think about splitting that up. That's the next part. Now, let's lean back, our defending range is all set, we are ready, we know which hands to play and now we think about how to split that up. And another read that we could have and we can use to exploit villain is a read on his preflopop reactions i mean the only thing when he needs to react is when we three bet so we will talk about three betting strategy here if i call pre-flop is over so he can fold a lot to three bets he can four bet a lot he can not fold right there is like he deviate in all directions. And this is what we should take into account when building our three betting range. Let's have a look at the different three bet strategies we might use. A very very common one is to 3-bet linear. What does does that mean i just show a little graph here to represent a linear three betting range to show it to you it just means nothing else but we take the top of our range top x percent whether it's five percent seven nine i don't care it just linear. The best hands we're having, nothing else. What is that good for? It will give us great equity post flop. Which problems does it cause? Well, we sometimes get into spots where we 3-bet something like pocket 8s, the board is K9, and we have a medium strong hand that we need to navigate through postflop. It's neither a bluff nor a value bet at any point, so we might face tough postflop spots. And another problem is that once this is all from one area all high cards and peers the best hands. So on certain boards it will be impossible for us to really have air. So now let's think about who is the perfect opponent to play that against. We have great equity postflop so that means we want to play post flop. Would be someone who does not fold to three bets. Troublesome medium strong hands post flop. Hmm so that would be perfect or not a problem against someone who is not playing well post flop and he calls a lot pre-flop but then it's easy to play against post flop the lack of air post flop is perfect against someone who calls anyways right who does who is not ready to make the exploit of overfolding understanding that we always have it so i'm three betting linear when villain is a big calling station pre-flop and post-flop then i want to take the maximum amount of equity and build a pot and three bet to get the maximum value the next option is to three bet polarized Again, I'm just showing you a chart that I clicked on randomly to just have a representation of something polarized. We take the very very top and we add bluffs. It's tough to talk about bluffs preflop because well something like 7-5 suited obviously has lots of equity against pretty much any range. But it is clearly on the weaker side. I picked hands that are on the lowest end of our defending range. Those that are close to play at all. So when is that good or what is that all about, the polarized 3-betting range? Thank you. at all. So when is that good or what is that all about, the polarized 3-betting range? We have, we create fold equity for our weakest hands. Villains know we 3-bet our strongest hands that might make them fold so we can gain EV by bluffing our weakest hands, by 3-betting them as well and get those folds from villains. The other thing as well is that we have fold equity post flop. We can 3-bet something like 7-5 suited, get a flop of K-10 deuce, c-bet and get all kinds of shit to fold. So this is another thing, not only making villain fold preflop but making him fold pulse flop as well. The problem we are having is that we have poor equity pulse flops, so if villain is very catchy and sticks to the pot we just won't win it too often. So let's think about that. Who is the perfect villain to 3-bet polarized against? Well it's a nit, right? Not talking about his raise first in but about his continuation. He over folds to our 3-bet so we have massive fold equity and he is a believer post flop so we have massive fold equity post flop if he decides to call that's the perfect victim for a polarized three betting strategy these were the two extreme examples i showed you either three bet linear just the best hands or polarize just the very best hands and the weakest hands we want to play. Against most villains, we'll go for some kind of mix, at least against every very good regular. I call it 3-betting a mix strategy. This is my baseline against anyone. It takes the best out of both worlds and in a way it is unexploitable. So let's talk about that being unexploitable. Let's have a look at that range. We see the clear top part, we see a a clear polarized part 5-6 suited, 4-6, 7-5, but some weaker hands like ace-9 off, king-10 off, queen-10 off, that's definitely not value hands. And some in-between hands that fit to a linear range like jack-9 suited, 10-9 suited, 10-8 suited suited it's not really a bluff but not really value either so it's kind of that middle part and now let's think about the reactions that villain can come up with villain can be for betting for example if villain is for betting against a linear range, we have the problem that, well, what are we folding? We 3-bet pocket 9s to then fold, and not folding at all is obviously something that is very easy to exploit because villain can just go straight for value. So, that's an issue. Here in that mixed range we find enough hands that we can fold to any sizing that villain uses as a forebet. Let's have a look at the polarized range. What do we do if villain min clicks in position? well our bluffs are so bad that we still need to fold them what can we do if he forbids very large well we still have to play our top end and we fold our bottom end so what we are lacking is the hands that we can react to something to villain sizing let's have a look at this mixed range villain can do whatever he want we will find hands to counter that if he min clicks sure i'm calling my suited aces i'm calling my suited kings my eight seven suited just all the time they are very playable i'm still folding my king nine off if he bets bigger i can react to that so this is the range i'm using as a baseline having both parts of it but here we are talking about exploiting and i always want to think that through now getting back to our two steps. Step number one I always want to find out how the skill difference is. The more edge I'm having the more clear reads I'm having where I can create EV postflop the wider I want to defend overall. And then step two when I think about how to split my defending range I'm thinking about in which direction to shift. Do I rather make use of fold equity and be more on the polarized side or do I want to get to the showdown more often with strong hands and don't expect the link to fold often to stay more on the linear side? Or I have no idea and I try to put the best out of both worlds in my strategy to be unexploitable myself? And last but not least, remember, these are all heads-up spots. We are just playing versus one open raiser. That means we can exploit as much as we want. There is no one behind with a capped range. So really, this is a spot to think about. And I recommend really that you check out my live play down there to see how I do that in game and think those things through.
