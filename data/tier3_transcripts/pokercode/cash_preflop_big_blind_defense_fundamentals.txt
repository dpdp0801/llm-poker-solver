### TOPIC: cash preflop big blind defense fundamentals
 In this video I'm going to talk about the fundamentals of the big blind defense. In the video about raising first in I already talked about how I think about charts. If you haven't seen that so far make sure to check that one out as well because it will help to understand how I think about the big blind defense as well. But let's go step by step. First let us talk about the situation itself. We have a villain who open raises and he open raises a certain range. At the same time, Willem uses a certain sizing, which gives us odds. We need to pay a certain price to participate in that pot. We can obviously 3-bet as well, that's a different thing. And then try to make plus-cv decisions to make money by defending. So far, so easy. Next step. The problem we are facing. We see the sizing that villain uses. We know the odds we are having. There's no way around that. But we have the problem that we cannot see villains range. We just see that he open raises. We sit down at the live table, someone open raises. We don't know whether he open raises 60% of hands on the button or just 20%. We have no clue. And even more we cannot see villains skill level. So I don't want to get into the exploitative talk right here because I will make an extra video about that but this is something to keep in mind. Regarding the range that we have no clue about we can have some idea how it might look like anyways. And the first idea is given by villain's position. Any reasonable player will be looser from the button and tighter from early position. So I want you to understand it that way. That seeing villain's position is the first step to have an idea of his range. If you have any more information, all that is better, because I'm not playing against a certain position, I'm playing against a certain range. One problem I'm seeing with all the charts out there it always says big blind versus button, big blind versus cutoff, big blind versus MP where in reality I don't care about that as soon as I have an idea about villain's range. If he's open raising 40% range I don't care whether he does that from the cutoff or from the button once I'm sitting there in the big blind and think about defending. Now once that is cleared up I have pretty much the first task for you because this is what you should look out for. You need to find out what villains open raising ranges are. If you can use a HUD, that's perfect. You will have good raise first instats after a couple of hands already. After a couple of hundred hands probably. But even if you're just playing on the life table, make sure to focus on that. Whenever you see a hand, did he have king seven off from the button. Did you see that go to showdown? Did you see pocket threes from under the gun? this is something to note because those tell you something about the overall structure of his range and That will be important when we think about building our big blind defending ranges. Okay, let's get to the next step. Lots of coaching sites will provide you charts. You find charts if you Google for them. Actually, I just did that and actually found some quite good ones. But again, as with raising first in, we need to understand them in the right way. This chart, the big blind defending range, shows us all hands that are profitable if. If villain plays a certain range. As I said, usually they are versus position. We are looking to play versus a a certain range as I said usually they are versus position we are looking to play versus a certain range if villain plays perfectly post flop given certain circumstances given the framework that is used to get those charts it needs us to play perfectly post-flop as well. If we don't do that, well, some of the break-even hands might get minus cv. And those charts work again for certain parameters, given rake structure, given blank structure, anti-structure, and so on and so on on. So it is very, very important to not take them as given. We can take them as a baseline to deviate from that. And how? I'm building my very own defending ranges every single time I'm facing an open race and I have some information. I will show you in the next step. Every time I'm facing an open race and I'm ready to defend in the big blind I go through two steps. First of them is I want to build my overall defending range. So far I'm not thinking about three bat and calling, just about which are the hands I want to be calling. Which doesn't mean anything else, but I try to find the weakest holding that I can defend profitably. I take into account the open raising range, or everything I know about it. If I just know the position, that's the first hint. The sizing, I can see the sizing and the given odds whether we have anti or a bigger small blind or whatever. I have certain odds and the range as close as I can get to that. Next thing is the skill level which we will talk about a little more in the part where I talk about playing exploitatively from the big blind. What you can see here in the chart is actually what I just described just looking at the weakest hands that I'm ready to defend. This is one of those charts I found, and these are the borders. This is a big blind versus button defense against a 2.5x open raise with a given rake structure on zoom 500 and a given post flop framework. So that says 9-5 suited is pretty much a frequency call, doesn't mean anything else but it is 0 EV. If I have edge this might get plus EV. If I'm not confident playing that it will definitely get minus EV. But I have a first idea and a baseline of how my defending range looks like. Every hand that is better than the ones shown, I will play. And that brings us to the next step. The split, I call it. Remember, so far we were just designing the defending range, thinking about the weak stance that we can play. We will defend all of the hands that are better than that threshold. And now it's our job to split that up using the two options we're having. Either calling or 3-betting. And to think about that, we can make use of what I talked about in the Raise First In video in general when it comes to preflop. The bigger villain sizing is the worse are our odds but at the same time the more dead money is out there. That gives us less incentive to be calling and more incentive to be three betting. The smaller villain sizing is the more hands we defend overall but of those hands most of the hands we will be calling given the great odds and we are less interested in three betting because there's not too much dead money to be won. So, we talk about that a little more in the exploitative part how to do that exactly but so far this is the split. We try to build our three betting range and at the same time then know our calling range. I just showed you here one example for a solver based chart that is big blind versus button versus a 2.5x open raise given the zoom 500 rake framework. I would call that a classic mixed three bet strategy having certain parts of hands and very very good board coverage. But as I said we'll talk about that in the next video a little more. Now coming back summarizing things. What do we need to focus on when thinking about big blind defense? We need to find out villain's range. Often we have information that is our job to get the maximum information possible to know villain's range. If we don't have that we can use his position as a first guess. We see the sizing villain uses, which gives us certain odds. We definitely have to take that into account. And then we go through that process with those two steps. First, thinking about our overall defending range. And then second, the split. Which of those hands do I want to call? Which of those hands do I want to 3-bet?
