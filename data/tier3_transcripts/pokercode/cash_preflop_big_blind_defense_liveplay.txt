### TOPIC: cash preflop big blind defense liveplay
 Welcome to the live play video where I will focus on the big blind defense. Again we are playing SUM200 and I use a very basic HUD to start exploiting the players. I want to introduce you to the stats I will be mainly using. Overall stats, VP, IP, PFR to have an impression of that player and then especially his raise first in stats depending on position. As we have learned, for me it is not about the position. Once I have further information, I'm only interested in am I playing versus 20%, versus 30% or versus 40% to know which range I'm facing. Once I have those stats, I don't care about the position anymore. So, and then it will be about building my big blind defense, starting with the first step, building my defending range, I focus and I will talk about the weakest hand I will be defending and that will depend a lot on, well, where do I see the post-flop edge? The weaker a player is, the more I know about where I can gain EV post-flop, the wider I will defend. If someone is really, really strong, well, my weakest hands won't make profit, so I defend on the tighter side. And then the second thing I will be talking about is building 3-bet ranges. Linear, mixed or polarized. So we'll keep an eye on fold to 3-bet if I have an idea there. Alright let's just jump right into it. Let's see which spots come up and yeah, let's just have fun I guess. Again, don't worry if I just might have an interesting hand but I'm not really talking about it. I really try to focus on big blind defense now all right so four seven off being the first hand here we're playing in the big blind we have someone right now going through what i'm looking at not enough stats to use the the positional race first in stats so i just see 28 22 reasonable players so i go with my baseline and 7-4 off is definitely not in there. Let's just wait for the next big blind. Jack-8 off might get interesting already. Definitely defending that against the small blind open. Against the button I would defend if that is a weaker player which is not the case right here. Against the sizing even here. He sizes up or let's say he just sizes bigger than I would do in his shoes. This is a fold and given the extra play doesn't change little looser open raising here. So this is when I want to increase my frequencies as well a little because the question is just which range am I playing against. I'm not playing versus MP. I'm either playing versus 18% or versus 24% and if he knows the players here he might be a little on the looser side here. Obviously lots of guessing game right but that's the big part of it. So king-8 suited. Next one the big blind top right. Let's focus on that one. Definitely defend against anyone. Against the later position it will be sometimes a three bet if I decide to go with a somewhat polarized strategy or a mixed strategy and he just well what's what's his well who what what kind of player type is that 16 11 3 a super knit right let's tag him as a super knit and that means well he has on those few hands 100% fall to three bet so far it doesn't mean too much for me I'm just trying to play tight versus him, right? Because his opening range is probably not 30% from the cutoff. If it was, he wouldn't have 1611 stats. So I'll play it a little cautiously. I give myself huge postflop edge if someone's playing that tight. I don't expect him to be pretty good postflop. So we'll just see how it goes. And I'm definitely check calling my king eight here three six off bottom left nothing to worry about obviously here and this is now something i want to stick to if you've already seen my race first in live play i changed from um from three 3x to 2.5x to be even wider and exploit knits even more. And this is what I want to do here with my better hands as well, not only with my shithands. So left side, min raise from the button, from a loose player I have ace-2s off, that's a clear defend against the min raise, and my ace-2 suited. I say he is a nit player. I did my exploit. My money is made. Now I don't have to make up for that by defending light. This is over. Okay, top left. Big blinds defense. Clear call with my ace. And if he keeps barreling, I have bluff catcher. I expect him to check most of the time on the turn. Because I have lots of sevens. I have lots of aces. This can be still any kind of split, any kind of draw, so definitely calling any ace here anytime again. And the river now is the moment where my ace gets a pure bluff catcher. Alright so he just goes was it small or half on the flop i forgot that uh normal bet on the turn normal bet on the river he can have all kinds of queen tens he can have full air uh i just get beaten by seven and a ace king is queen so all my ace x should be indifferent in a way um having a deuce is unblocking bluffs right because he does not have like he could have four or five suited but he won't have deuce five suited so i like that a little more for the pure catch and uh just going with it uh expecting to be beat by his queen ace king quite often or a seven but right queen seven off shows us okay we knew he was a loose player by just those 60 hands or we had that first impression queen seven off is obviously out of this world uh from the button and now this is something to note right so i think it was this guy actually and i make him what's the right color here uh cannot see that just i don't know why blue not purple whatever right oh fuck timing out top right so now this is uh what what it costs me maybe he goes for a race that would have been cool um yeah maybe rejoining in second there uh talking too much about it um so i will just write the note down here. Open race queen seven off button. This is something you can do on the live table. I've seen one showdown. I know that this guy is not playing 43% on the button. I know that he's more in the 60s probably, maybe 55, maybe 60. So next time I'm defending my big blind, I will go wider for value. I will defend way wider against that weak range. And yeah, so I'm playing more perfectly against him. And that's the goal of it. Give him that read. And this is a pretty strong read if he really played that hand against me. Okay, X-King suited, good luck. 10 deuce off against a good player or reasonable stats from under the gun. Obviously 10 deuce of hearts, 10 deuce suited would be a call here actually. Not sure about the rake structure but in in the games I usually play like I know that tendu suited makes that tendu suited makes the cut just to give you some impressions regarding big blind defense how wide we can go and should four or five suited defending a pretty nice flop okay where the next big blind? Alright, bottom right we will focus on while I'm sometimes betting in that three bet pot, sometimes checking. Yeah I feel like going for it. Clear defense, big blind versus button, obviously now the knit three bet is not what we were looking for and now just trying to check down my four five and um if he bets we have a river decision actually this is now close to be a value bet he has lots of face highs uh the question is how often he goes for a check raise but i actually like to be on the thinner side there because i don't see people trapping too much that's now a little exploitative i guess it's slightly too thin. Maybe frequency bet. Yeah, I just say what I'm doing here is pretty much saying, hey, you just have ace king way more often than you should. And have the chance of him catching. Finding bluffs is not a problem at all. And let's actually open that replayer's just okay he had the hand i put him on it's not too tough in those positions but he has a bluff catcher he might end up calling it's just i'm saying i have the best hand so often and yeah that's pretty great getting some additional value there all right next big blinds coming east jack off can be a low frequency more of like a actually of a polarized range in a way or uh because it tries to fold out stuff but getting call it's it's part of a mixed strategy to have it in there sometimes against a player i have no reads on i just i would go with my standard and maybe have that with low frequency but the standard is the call but I cannot even maybe I can say okay I probably have a little post-flop edge just because I'm better than the average zoom 200 player but I don't have any info on him and yeah yeah I actually start betting my ace-jack. Bottom left 7-9 suited very very clear defend we can sometimes 3-bet but this guy 20-16-3 seems to be one of the nits as well so far did not really fold to three bats so this relies on lots of fold equity uh that hand and um i don't find the reason right that would be in a very polar if someone uh polar strategy if someone is really um if someone really likes to fold to three bats it's a perfect one to go with um here that can be a check raise sometimes actually and um yeah i keep timing out while talking so i need to get used to it a little more again i hope that gets better over time pocket force i would be calling often if the big blind is weak but he is pretty as looks like a little on the looser side and yeah so just letting it go but versus cutoff bottom right um he seems to be really nitty as well or it's we have seen that guy a couple of times already so i'm just calling here four betting is definitely fine but i'm facing very tight three bad range so ace king is not really a clear value for that. So yeah. Calling. Don't see someone from under the gun 2016 now going for the cheap bluff. So I'm just over folding here, but that's an exploitive thing. So, um, might be, might be right. Might be wrong. Obviously bottom, right. love to see that um while focusing a little more on the four five off right now we are facing a 3x so how do i build my defending range here definitely not four or five off in there but we need to be a little tighter given that price and um yeah and then decide all of our defending range we will move a little towards the aggressive direction there's more dead money out there and the worst price so calling is not that interesting but three betting is something like king nine suited is a hundred percent three bet for me here something like well all kinds of hands right shifting a lot into the direction of three betting, right? So this is now again talking about how to build those ranges there while trying to win a stack on the bottom right against someone who sizes down on the turn, probably having lots of kings, queens, maybe a random ace that would be perfect. I have a clear value race. Lots of cards I don't like, so I like that race and i would keep slow playing lots of sets for example um and now jamming ace four off okay the super nuts um yeah downsize did not really make sense right so um on that turn sizing small checking is fine uh betting big is, but betting small to make me just call my weak ace that calls any bet. I don't know. But that's fine. Like losing a flip, right? We can four bet and get it in as well. Bottom left is the next interesting one where he went for 2.25x if I remember correctly. So I need to adjust correctly to that. Maybe the weakest aces will be close against that sizing. Ace-2 is talking about ace-2 off. Ace-4 definitely makes the cut. Now I need to react to his flop sizing given that bigger size I have a clear fold. If not my ace high with a backdoor straight plus backdoor flush card can be cool but yeah and top right that should be again good for for another value bet here. Okay where's our next big blind? 6-3 suited. I will defend that against any position if villains are not sizing up dramatically. So that guy playing 78 big blind stack or something that is enough for me to tag him as probably a weaker player Which makes me like to defend that even more. I have no further info So I would go with some kind of baseline when it comes to 3 betting And definitely defending my bottom pierce, it's not like Quarter pot it's it's actually like 35 so i can make some faults it's his board pretty much but not having the bottom pair plus back to our flush draw which is a big plus here for me and i'll have having pretty pretty easy decisions having a five outer two two pair and drips plus what is it nine outs to make a flush and yeah that's a beautiful one actually i feel like i want to be donking that would be very very exploitative just putting him on ace 10 given his sizing that might check back sometimes i cannot check race but obviously it doesn't make any sense the three is a brick i'm just lucky to hit my two pair this time and uh yeah snap it off seeing a full full blow up that's perfect and um yeah maybe this is not bottom right not big blind defense but we see a 12-9 player right this is not he might have aces all the time right but he will be a very bad player plus someone who is marked blue which is my recreational player color so i go and start having a small bind calling range here actually even though i'm just three betting only usually pocket deuces i obviously defend big blind versus small blind bottom left nothing to there, this will never be a three bet. I have to call my peer against a small continuation bet and I just bottom right go for a straight value. And sure that guy might have a flush now, but probably he has more queens and jacks, right? He's that tight, what is his actual actual range so i'm just trying to get the most out of a hand of that i don't expect a 12-9 player to to ever bluff me there he's like probably a call maybe not call looking at his queens so actually i'm like don't go a little bigger than just the block um and yeah expect to be but get called quite often and if he raises he has a better hand he can have nines um and then i just i mean nine's not really but yeah that's all cool okay top right i think i just have to get it in given that guy who always has 10 somehow. I don't know, someone who... Yeah, that cold call and the cold four from an aggressive player. I definitely cannot let that go even though we are 128 big blind steep. But that's not the topic for today. Bottom right, defending deuce four suited against a weaker is super happy uh about making that call um and this is a flip with lots of dead money out there and that seems to be going well ah jinxed it i guess okay bottom right big blind defense i will never check raise those weak flush draws here. Now that is an interesting card. I don't really want to check raise and open the door against a weaker player where I do not really know what's up. So I like to just, the five is a really good card for me here. I don't know how much the donk makes sense. Plan to buy me a card and fold something out like king ten of hearts. So yeah, Little special thing. Okay, let's see whether we find did see that small on that board. I hit the top here on the turn. I keep going small. He raises now. He should do that with something like king 10, which I do not see that often. I'm definitely calling my 10. Now that should kill the action quite a lot he can have some low flushes that he can raise on the turn to fold up better flush draws but his sizing was was more like not really polarizing that much so um check check maybe he was just annoyed by my small sizing yeah having I mean I think that open enter that's interesting sorry that didn't go well this one is correct yeah so I don't know he gets the good price I don't see a big reason for him to race they are ever he runs the risk of me re-raising and then folding an open ender so i think that does not really make sense but um all right bottom left again um don't have enough stats but first impression 3124 loser player i play standard um he has a high fall to three bet i will sometimes three bet a hand like that to increase to to put that into my polarized part so let's just do that to showcase that as well a nice blocker i rely on fold equity um and if he calls right pretty much the job of that hand is somewhat done right it's it's additional value that's just something i'm having like i'm doing 10 of the time or something now just to showcase it uh it to you that this can be a three bet as well and covers like some of the ace high boards right what what are we having on ace high boards ace king and ace queen right but what if the action is slower which aces are we having ace five suited that's it so just having that sometimes with some frequency I think the board is actually good enough to put a bet out there I have all that jack nine jack ten queen ten suited type of stuff so it's it's it's okay having that ace of clubs especially if I had ace of spades seven of hearts I would just let it go here I have barrel opportunities and yeah now the ace of clubs turns to be a turns out to be a bad card on that turn. Blocking his folding range and probably just checking down all the time. That queen. Really tough for me to really have ear here. So I think I'll just try my best and over bluffing that's not not a great card that ace of clubs especially is very very bad to have but yeah and l200 is a limit where you want to keep trying especially with those small bets if right he has pocket fives and is folding so yeah just the risk-reward taking that is pretty great i don't even know which believable story i'm telling but that's fine okay let's take the king queen off as the last one bottom right. So yeah, again, we are playing against a range, right? This is the main message from today. And this guy plays 13-10 overall, usually against a normal button open raising range. King-queen is a fine three bet with some frequency. But against someone that tight, why, right? No, I'm just calling calling this one it's pretty much like playing versus a normal under the gun range maybe right i don't have enough info on how his button range looks like um but just exaggerating a little to showcase that it's not the button this is if i know it maybe a 25 range maybe a 30 range so i'm playing as if i'm playing against the cutoff or mp and um yeah here i mean donking can be a thing uh i will keep checking here it's again it's he can have king x as well so i i rather donk if he does that big on the flop because that takes away his king-axe and then it's me always having it. This scares me a little. A 13-10 guy. Yeah, I mean might have pocket eights but I stick to the call button here. No reason to raise really. If he went with a normal sizing I would consider raising but yeah he went with the Queen Jack river Jack that makes a lot of sense right blocking my best King X so actually that post club was fine and yeah let's wrap it up here and summarize again what we've learned and went through. It's obviously tough to find the perfect spots but again taking into consideration the range we are playing against. Give it the best guess if we have no read we take the position as the best guess. If we know anything else we take this as the best guess. If we take into account post flopflop edge, how is this player playing, right? This guy, again, we have 10-10, 2.8 over 80 hands. He has aces here, right? I don't need to defend my king-jack. And this is the same for reacting with a big blind defense to the open raiser. And the next step, if we have further information, building building our range we should know how does a baseline of a three-bet strategy looks look like against a certain range and then deviate from that and shift it a little more towards the polarized part when there is fold equity or good fold equity or people over folding i'd like like i just just put my a7 off in a three betting range which is a fine hand right or just go totally linear when someone is well not folding um a big whale who's played like 42 15 uh zero percent fall to three bet those people exist as well as well less in the zoom pools but on the normal tables as well. And especially on the live tables. There we go totally linear. And anything else between, we are looking for finding some kind of mix that is fine. So again, building defending range and then thinking about the split. Taking into account range, sizing, postop skill, reaction to our 3-bet. And now again, go out, play yourself, enjoy it, learn from it, discuss in the community, ask all kinds of questions. They are happy to answer. And yeah, see you in the next one.
