### TOPIC: cash preflop guide
 All right, let's jump into the topic, understanding preflop. So I double checked myself. We have two coachings or at least videos regarding preflop so far. One I just call like simple preflop or standard preflop. There are videos on the platform, plenty of them, I'm pretty sure. And one was advanced preflop. I will quickly try to summarize those that we know what we we've talked about if you have never heard of those make sure to write it down and search for it on the platform you will definitely find it and maybe keep that for later and keep it in mind that there is something else you can digest for your preflop feelings and then for this coaching we'll go to some general ideas i want to implement today what I mean when I talk about cornerstones cornerstones of our range cornerstones of memorization I will talk about the two concepts preparation and domination and then as always I'll leave you with some key takeaways that you can take into your next session to crush in the very next hour or the very next session you're playing if If I play only MTT, is this lecture still helpful? I'd say clear yes from my side if you're interested in that topic, because it's only examples that I use that are from cash game, but I always structure my lessons in a way that works for any kind of poker. Just it's a logical way of thinking instead of just saying this is what you need to do in the cash game scenario xyz. So it's the logical part about it. You need to maybe transfer that for MTT examples. Sometimes you play with anti, you play way looser, there's limping involved especially in the blinds. So this is a different part. But MTT poker 100 big blinds deep chip EV is the same like cash game if we take the anti away so everything applies in mtt's also all right so i think the plan is clear i hope i made clear that you can feel free to ask any questions you see i answered the first ones already and i i try to keep doing so and always take a break and keep catch up with the chat. So let's start with a summary of the simple pre-flow part. The main things we learned in that coaching was that I told you that any freaking reasonable chart you find is pretty good. I don't want to see any discussions whether we need to open raise king five suited from under the gun or whether we should mix queen jack offsuit or just not play it or play it it freaking doesn't matter and the main thing is that all those borders nowadays we have the tools like gto wizard for example to see in a perfect world how much money those hands were making. And in a perfect world, they make zero money or slightly plus or slightly minus if you are unsure about the exact borders. So actually what you do there does not matter. I always give you, let's actually do that again because it's so eye-opening for lots of players who never looked never looked at it like that this is a small blind first in opening range if we play race only and we see that 9-8 offsuit has 0 ev 10-8 offsuit you mix it it really doesn't matter right and the best hand we obviously have has the most ev which is pocket aces they should on average win 7.66 big blinds. So if you think about playing jack four suited or ten five suited or queen deuce like let's say hands that are somewhere between plus 0.05 and zero whether you play them or not it really doesn't matter. Timing out once with aces is 100 times worth than doing everything right or everything wrong with those hands so before you start thinking about how exactly to play those hands make sure that you freaking never time out with aces because you're on a freaking toilet run or you have an unstable internet connection or anything else this is just the relation of ev between those types of hands really i don't want you to overvalue those whatever things right and now the other thing is that continuing this is a like every pre-flop action in the end is a preparation to then play a post-flop spot. Now those EV numbers, which is the third bullet point here, that are shown in those programs, they really show the EV given perfect play under certain parameters from both sides. So whenever people are not playing perfectly, which is true for you, which is true true for me which is true for everybody out there um things are different right so you need to this is what we started already a little more in the advanced preflop i'll come to that in a second as soon as you start thinking exploitatively are you worse than someone in this specific spot or are you better? This changes everything, right? Against the weakest player in the world, I'm definitely playing an E2 there. And instead of, I'm just looking it up on the side, 7-deuce offsuit, open raising, where is it? Would lose me 37% of a big blind. I'm pretty sure against the weakest player in the world, I can play a plus EV. So it shifts quite a lot and we shouldn't really kill ourselves with thinking about tiny, tiny, tiny spots. All right, so evaluating this is way more important. And everything we can do that is off from evaluating how good we are and villains are is just looking at us. So knowing our range is really the key that you know what you're doing and then you can start playing post-flop better hopefully than your opponent or know at least a little what you're doing all right this was everything we talked about the the in the simple pre-flop session really that i told you don't care too much about what is close. I think we started the coaching with Googling six max preflop charts. We found different ones and they were all fine, right? Because they either tell you, okay, you take all those close hands or you don't take those a little too tight, a little too loose, or something in between with all the mixes, who cares? All right, so if there are any questions, still, I'm happy to answer all of them. Now the summary of advanced free-flop. Here we started to put things to the exploitative level. I told you already that those numbers are in a perfect world, in a theory-driven world, where everyone plays somewhat correctly, which obviously has nothing to do, hopefully, with the games we're playing. We should mainly be playing games where we are better than our opponents. At least that's my goal and hopefully your goal or very likely your goal if you're here with us at Poker Code. So yeah, the evaluation of villains plays key relatively to our skill level, right? It's a big, big, big strength in my eyes if you can tell me that in certain spots you are just not good. If I sit down now after not playing a lot the last month and I have Linus Love to my left, I can just freaking tighten up in the small lines. I tell him you get those theory 0.04 big blinds per 100 EV. I'm just not playing this hand. This means I won't make a mistake post-flop. Obviously range construction and so on, once he sniffs that out, he can adjust post-flop probably play everything else a little better as well. But he can't know to start with. So I can just say he's playing perfectly. I'm not playing perfectly. This is why I shouldn't open raise like hands that are just barely plus eb or zero eb. And the other way around, I already gave the example someone is super shit, I can start playing more hands. All right. We talked a lot about understanding the incentivization to exploit. We have different things we can do. Now I talked about tightening up, about loosening up. We can already also adjust our sizings or even go with a crazy multiple sizing strategy, knowing what we want to achieve with our hands. This is really where we start playing. We have a hand versus a certain range. We know what players are doing. And so on maximum exploit level, things can get very, very wild. This is the dream for us that we know one player exactly, best case, a very weak player. And we understand the counters or best things for our hands to get the maximum out of it right sitting down there at a certain level versus recreational who loses freaking 100 big lines per 100 well that's the freaking dream and it's it's our job to get the maximum out of it another thing is that it's okay if you don't understand that right now i think it's a little too far going there in depth again. It's all in the advanced preflop session we had. I don't know when, but it's quite a while ago. I talked about zero equity EV. That's kind of a spots where you can gain EV without caring about your hand, right? Just knowing that villain does certain mistakes that will make you money. Hunt that, right? The easiest, this can be in all stages of the game tree, but the easiest one would be someone open raises and freaking over folds to three bets that you have immediate profit. Well, then you just do that. Then this is where you can make money disregarding your hand. All right, so Diddy with a question. How do you like the idea of giving up certain preflop parts to play more tables, increase EV, if yes which parts are crucial to keep playing even though they are 0 EV? So I think this is a beautiful idea. I try to always do that especially my let's say supernova elite years where I rather play lower win rate. But make sure I get S&E in time, right? This is an extreme example. But also we should when I split down my sessions into kind of a working session where my goal was not max big blind for 100, but my goal was max dollar per hour. per hour. So in the end, when we try to see poker as a job or we want to maximize our profit, for example, for tournament players on a Sunday night, I think Sunday night is not the time where you want to be learning. This is the time where you really want to apply what you've learned and get the maximum out of it. This makes a hell of a lot of sense. And second part, what I did was mainly in the morning when tables were worse back then, I tried to focus on my play to give myself time to think that decisions through and not go maximum tables. So I had a clear goal every session and it was either max dollar per hour, it was max bb per 100 at the same time with learning and creating interesting spots that i thought through in game mark them take time to make notes and then review them so really two different goals when playing a session can be very very different and the one was like eight eight tabling zoom click click click click click no way i'm marking something or even making notes on the side that was just too much because this was the time to make money now second part of the question giving up certain pre-flop parts to play more tables yes i said that which parts are crucial to keep playing even though they are zero ev crucial to keep i would say does not exist pretty strong opinion on that actually because it only matters when villains can't find out if they are somehow adjusting so yeah since they are not seeing your faults it's impossible that they that they understand what you're doing i mean they're obviously it's it's obvious that maybe early in a sunday you play more tables and you're not taking every small spot that's maybe what you're exploiting as well versus other players or no one is doing it and it's just about staying in i don't know but there is no crucial part because if someone is playing just some kind of normal game you have it black on white or white or on black whatever what your ev is and it's your decision to take it or not it just changes if people are adjusting that they are saying like okay no you're never having suited connectors low suited connectors you're never having the low pockets from earlier positions you're never having that and this is where they adjust their post-flop game and so on. Where I would say in the spots where we go max dollar EV, this is just bullshit. Like let's say it's a Sunday 7 p.m. or whatever the main time now is for tournaments. This is we are playing max dollar EV because this is where the highest amount of fish is, the best amount of tournaments and and so on, that there is some adjusting not possible and you play enough hands with the wrecks that your stats are somewhat okay and they won't have like some kind of stats or reads that you are during that time or never playing that. If that makes sense. I like never thought about that too much about the second part of the question, but I have a first instinct, very strong opinion on that there's not a single part that is crucial. Okay, deep into Mordor seems related to time EV. On Zoom tables you can skip low EV hands because you don't have to wait for the next hand. Trading off hand EV for time EV. Exactly, right ev exactly right so if a hand is zero ev you can just skip it and play the next table best thing would be that you can scan your table and even go crazy if it's a super tough table and overhaul the shit out of it and if it's a soft table you think twice and maybe can go crazy wide even would be next next next level and and takes lots of brainpower while screening those tables. But yes, this is very important for us when we take poker as a profession or as a moneymaker. It's not about getting the best graph in BB per hundred. Lots of people love that. Looks great. Takes a lot of time, but they want to make the most money in the time they have so yeah it's another part of game selection in a way playing the right game and then playing the right hands in the right time in the right game sounds weird but i hope it makes a lot of sense so any any follow-up questions there are very welcoming i think it's a beautiful topic and fits perfectly into into session here, just talking about stuff like that. But maybe beginners definitely didn't think about, but already people like who grinded out, I'm like NL25, NL50, NL100, never wasted a second on that. For those especially, the main part is still learning, right? If you're at a point where you want to make it in poker or you want to focus on getting better this is the key right this long term will make you the most money but especially like mtt players who have a solid schedule they can be playing i think they are it is most important in the right time to get the maximum amount of hands in all right so summaries done very good question so far 20 minutes in i think we're we are on a good track so let's see what the general ideas were i want to i want to talk about today very basic very easy it's still pre-flop there is nothing crazy with pre-flop you won't learn like some crazy concepts today maybe a little helper to how you can you can work with your preflop. So what is preflop happening? We want to prepare for the upcoming spot. Second point, the upcoming spot is often unclear, which will lead to lots of mixes, especially in GTO Wizard. So once we know more which spots come up more often because people have certain tendencies, we can deviate already a little, but usually we don't know that if we are not a little further in the game tree. The more players are left to act, the more we just need to start with something good. So my image for that is as very often just a football team. So a little question for you guys now. Drop some football players names. I'm not asking you for the best, but in your personal top 10, choose one out of the top 10. We don't need like 10 Messi's, Ronaldo's, I'm old. Here just take one player out of your personal top 10. And drop it out there. Or you can go like five players. All right, we got Thierry Henry, Luis Suarez. So more old people. Mario Mosberg, obviously. Tomasz Rosicki, Jamal Musial, Christian Vieira, or is it... there's another one as well, right? No, it's Christian Vieira. Who is this French guy, right? Robin van Persie. Christian Vieri? Dennis Undorf. Wow. Andreas Herzog. All right, all right, all right, all right. Here we go. All right, we counted down. I think we see lots of players who are obviously quite familiar with football. Can any one of you give me the the numbers the number of defenders we have seen here zero all right how many goalies do we see all right so I was gonna say Khan here we go I was waiting for this one but yeah kind of a problem because maybe yeah maybe for some spots let's say we're not talking about a full match we're talking about different spots that come up right villains get the ball and they play counter-attack maybe you want to have two fast defenders and you want to have a goalie right well if you play like by munich style and you have the ball all the time and then like okay yeah maybe you want to have that one striker who just puts the goal in or just having Musiala is probably not too bad. But just saying there are different kinds of player types, better for different situations. Once you don't know what the situation is, you usually just start with the best players. This is kind of a maybe Pep Guardiola argument as well. He just wants to make it happen that the best players play he's not looking for the best defender not for the best but he takes the best players and builds the system around them a little obviously he just chops whatever he wants but still he plays like some random center back who will play midfield in like certain times and then he plays like i don't know it's not pep but like grimaldo from leverkusen coming to mind who is like kind of a 10 playmaker. Then he is a winger at the same time, but officially he is listed like as a defender. So lots of stuff like that, where I think of that, like often, like who would you vote first in back in sports? And usually you just take the Musialas out of this world or your whole list, which is nothing else, but a freaking linear range. I would say, right. We just take the best hands that we know here, rank through equity, but we don't even know equity against what, so just the best hands possible. They are highest chance of winning. Let it be like a freaking one versus one on like a small pitch, whatever your image is for that. But there are different ranges that we are also building where we are not taking the best ones, right? A little more polarized ranges or like a polarized part to the ranges or now maybe very interesting for the MTT players, let's say you play a little shorter you have a little icm involved you play with limping blind versus blind you have like certain areas where you open race where you limp where you open jam where you rather prepare easy reactions then you do just like i have a good hand i put money in the middle right so it's like this is a concept uh that we need to learn that for certain areas we need certain types of hands. All right. We need to play some football with poker in the summer. We definitely should do that. Okay, so now since we're still preflop and for now we're just talking about an unraised pot, unopened pot, we can say preflop is just about repetition. Actually I wrote that down yesterday when was i was sitting together with reiner kempi two days ago and he said something like that what would i need to do if i want to play like a very good tournament poker and i wouldn't mess up like big big spots but i would mess up lots of small spots because i'm just not in practice i would just do lots of preflop stuff, work things through, just repeat, repeat, repeat. And he used the word homework. It's like doing homework. I wouldn't need a coach for anything, whatever. Just give me some things to work at, maybe actually from someone who is into it, and then just put in the work, like lots of homework. And this is what preflop is, right? You can learn so many things and make sure you do not mess up because this prepares you so freaking well for everything that comes next. Okay, I drink a little something. That's what I told him. All right, so Diddy, here we go. Perfect. I love it. It's very good. This is just what it is. So this is what we're talking about today. So actually, I have no clue what the next is. The next thing should be cornerstones. So now since it's just about doing homework and learning ranges, right? We have them out there. We have a session on how we should adjust and why. But now today I want to talk about really understanding things like why is this range like that and how should I learn it. How do you manage the feeling in game that you are not nailing it yet? Go back, do your homework again. Very easy answer to your question go back, do the homework again, do more of your homework, and then you do it again. Then you play again, write down the hands that you felt unsure about, check it out if it was close, understand, and take on what we've learned here. If it's really close, it doesn't matter. Give a shit about it. It's fine. And tell yourself you did it great. You had a weird feeling about it. It's exactly the border. It's perfect. If it's totally off, you've learned something, and you do your homework again. All right, let's get to the cornerstones then. There are not too many freaking parts. This might look a little confusing at first sight, but there are not many things to think about, right? So, focus on offsuit first. Offsuit makes your frequencies. If you get suited a little wrong, it really does not matter. If you get pocket pairs a little wrong, it really does not matter. Get more precise when we're in the reaction game. Reaction game means something happened already, right? Someone open raised and so on. We're playing a tighter range usually then. We are further on in the game tree, less to play for anymore. So it's like less stack to pot ratio, less game tree to play for. Obviously there's still lots of money to play for, but then we need to get a little more precise. Our three betting ranges need to be a little more precise than our opening ranges. This is, who can tell me? Sorry, it's a simplified GTO nl 500 break who can tell me which open raising which positions open raising range that is here we go jerome right ryan hell no are we not open raising every king 10 offsuit from the cutoff we definitely do that so it's it's the hijack so right some people definitely did their homework looking at that snap telling me that this is the hijack is very good if you're a 100 big blind cash game player. If you're an MTT player, probably you guys take that from like Under the Gun 7. Who knows, right, how much anti there is in the middle. I don't care. I don't know. This is good for your game. You did your homework, right? So, Rein back to homework, opening ranges, certain positions, or maybe you just Google another chart and tell me it's also fine, which probably is okay. So yeah, everything we need to remember. And this is now, like this is the way I learn. The more into detail I go once, the better I can remember it forever. So understanding that where we are at and what we want to look at with those things to really understand. So here we have three things. I start with offsuit. I always make this little line to understand. We have the 10x line that starts getting mixed. Kind of easy to remember. Under the gun it would be like the Jack-X line where King-Jack and Queen-Jack are already partly mixes, but that's about it. And then the Ace is always like one more. You get a feeling for how it's structured. This is why I put it like that. This is something you can put in the red pencil here or whatever you want to call it. This is something you can put in every chart. The pocket pair obviously like is it deuces threes fours fives whether you mix them like that or you mix them evenly who cares right that you i could make the same thing for fives because this is the first one we take 100 but again fives are winning 0.04 compared to our aces 10.59 big blinds so So who really cares about pocket fives as long as you have ever timed out with aces in your life? Don't care about the fives. All right and then we got the suited parts where everything is kind of whatever but we see okay the eight x kind of tells us something. This should give you feeling those middle-ish suited hands here you take the 8x and the other other king-x and ace-x is always a little more. And this is always the same. Tighter ranges, looser ranges, and so on. If you can tell me in all those ranges where especially the offsuit part is, you're doing a hell of a good job. And this will lead to more understanding post-flop as well, right? Someone who understands that very well can tell me that it's a big, big difference whether you play 10-10 deuce or you play 8-8 deuce. Or a 7-7 deuce. Just understanding how often do you have which hands. Very important. Understanding how often you hit a certain two pair do you have it off suit or not on a turn be honest is this little goose sorry i have no homework for him so far no too young too young so i just uh we just went to how do you call it elton kintun so like like sports together with with parents so with me in this case and i try to put into his head that a coach is really cool so i want to prepare him that sports is a thing in his world and going somewhere where he gets coached or there is something like code that this is a person of respect and is very cool at the same time so he got his coach emil right now and this is what i try to focus on right now right so Didi I like to think of a square aces to ace 10 off ace 8 square this is like a line oh and then the square up to ace 8 yeah it's kind of the same thing right your ace 10 off is my 10x line because the top left corner is always the same. So what you think about the 10x line and the 8x line on the suited side, that's your square, right? Very good point. Let's just put that in paint to make other people understand that as well. Didi's way of thinking, he doesn't think about those borders. He puts two of them together, I would say, and thinks and thinks in a square right let's make it freaking blue he puts his square in here right wherever those let's say 100 or high frequency offsuit hands are and the high frequency suited hands that we take all the time again i want to repeat that suited really doesn't matter you see already that 10-8 suited, Jack-8 suited, Queen-8 suited are all 0.01. Who freaking cares, right? If you do it like that, that would be a mistake, right? Including the 9-x on the opposite side is a hell lot of combos and they are all clearly minus cd because we see that they are all 0%. So that would be a mistake. This here would not be a mistake and And even this year would not be a real mistake. Obviously, we don't want to lose that ace 10 off. At some point, it gets too much. But this is pretty clear that the ace is a little better and the suited aces are a little better. So he works with the square, I split up to three things were actually just the pocket pairs. Who cares about that too much? Square rectangle square is a square is a quadrat. This is a square. This is a rectangle. I think so, right? So it's fine. You show rectangle. Let's take the rectangle. Okay, very good. So let's go to the next, right? I think the next one is a little test for you guys guys or you can try it yourself to come up with three things so three bet cutoff versus hijack sorry to all the mtt players this is for cash game now you can think about the missing o in the offsuit and the suited and the pocket pair what are the lines hijack open raises we think about three betting where are your lines you can type in combos also important is the offsuit thing that you don't mess it up there and the others are like somewhat whatever and I can already tell you if you have no clue I'll send you back to homework I can't help you with that you can cheat Miguel just like move yourself three positions earlier and then you take your MTG range. Where's the first brave person in the chat? MTG player detected. King Jack offsjack offsuit. Alright, let's see whether we find some traces of a king-jack offsuit in the 3-bet. We find some. We find the 5%, 10%. Alright, I love it. So Jason looks pretty great. Alright, so Tupac gives us a full range. So my line would be ace-jack off, king-queen off. For me, it's just logical that like ace-queen, ace-king is, if I say that, that's obviously included because we play three-bet only, that every better hand is included. King-queen offsuit means that like king-jack is not part of it, queen-jack is not part of it. And then like this, the line of suited 9-exit looks like, king-9 suited, queen-9 suited. It's a little better than Jack 9 suited probably and pocket 9s plus. So premium hands 10s plus. All right. Jerome probably doing the most homework on those ranges. Ace, Jack, King, Queen, Broadway suited. All right. So they're the line. I'm not looking for Broadway suited, which is obviously right. But my brain works like I take the suited 10x line or the suited 9x line and then add a little bullshit of the King X and the ace x. We always know we can take a little more there. Let's just look it up. Where is it? Example one. Oh we have it here. I don't need to put it in there. All right so we have the ace, jack, king, queen. Actually not full frequency. Doesn't matter. You can leave it it away. You start ace, queen. It's all good as long as no one knows. We have not even the 9x line. We have the 10x line. That's some king, nine. So queen, nine is already stretched. We add a little of that. Okay, understanding that ace, five somehow is a little, but you see it's the same. Ace, five is so cool. It's 100%. Those are zero EV, and this is apparently 0.01. So you shouldn't give a fuck. And if I get you with A6 suited, it's fine. I don't send you back to homework. Adding this a little, little, little, little, absolutely unnecessary. You can, you don't need to. If someone is not doing that, well, there is an exploit and that is just folding the shit out of it versus this guy right if this bluffing part is missing um but yeah who cares if you take villain strategy as given and don't think he can read into what you're doing because you're not playing forever with him he doesn't have any read and so on there are no no studs no no no no whatever you can just freaking knit it up if you want you could loosen up also if you want so it's just you're playing a hand that has zero ev and then it's way more about the skill difference that that you should leverage really playing those hands why king jack off is better here than ace 10 offsuit well that will have to do with certain domination effects or equity about the exact hands that you will be playing against that villain is for example with king jack offsuit you always fall out king queen offsuit and you're maybe a little less dominant but it's like forget about that it's both zero ev bucket ace is also zero EV. Unblocking ace-axe which fold, but at the same time blocking ace-axe which continue. So with those wide ranges, I'm not a big fan early in the game tree to talk about blockers. That's more like a MTT thing when we get shorter, more shallow when the all-in is rather near. Here it's the blocker, yes, we can maybe influence the fold equity by one or two percent, but usually at the same time then have a little worse of a spot post flop when cards fall that way, because then we are probably dominated more often. So really when ranges are still rather wide and it's a still longer, longish way directional i really wouldn't focus on blockers how do you like knitting up against people you don't want to play against good regs while maxing everything like five four suited crap versus recreationals versus recreationals depends a lot versus over folders i take all that shit versus recreationals i go equity so i rather add in queen nine suited than i play four or five suited and against good wrecks my relative skill level is worse like maybe i'm still better but not that much where i'm even worse then i'm obviously playing less hands right if if gto wizard shows me it's zero ev then it's maybe against this person minus 0.02. perfect thing to know would be obviously is he calling a lot now and then over folding over the streets is he four betting never or always this would be a way bigger influence that way no now football again in mind which spots are coming up am I defending against the four bet which hands do I need maybe then it's cool to have some 4-5 suited that we can call. Is he only calling? Well then maybe taking just hands that, well just higher equity hands are usually better. If we see a flop very often just having the better hand playing lots of taking Q9 suited to play versus his pocket sevens is way better than taking four five suited. Or king x coverage, yeah this is some preparation board coverage but we take it as it is as it is written down there in the freaking GTO wizard it's both zero ev. And the frequency thing is more an understanding of would it be easy to exploit that. Right probably yeah maybe Maybe it's the King X coverage. In ACE 10, we have so many ASICs already having all those suited ASICs. Makes a lot of sense, I think. So lots of things that are absolutely right, but for me, it's important. It's not like that I couldn't go deeper into detail or maybe try and find the reason, but I want to tell you that it really doesn't matter. Okay, example number one, let's go example number two. We go a little tighter, a little tighter, we are deeper in the game tree now. Button open raises, small blind three bets, it's us in the big blind, we think about cold four betting. So we've already learned the tighter we are, the more precise we need to be. And we focus still on offsuit. We really don't want to mess up offsuit. This is important here. So your cold forebet range, big blind versus small blind versus button. No rocket science. Just first instinct, write it down to really do it once. 10s plus, king jack suited plus, ace 10 suited plus, ace spin off plus. Right? So one thing here, I want you to start with offsuit just because to keep your focus on for every spots, it's most, here it's super easy. We don't never take ace jack and even ace queen should be a mix. Once you've seen that range once, probably pretty clear. We definitely never take king queen offsuit. I hope I'm not messing up now. We take offsuit first because this will make your range in all the other spots here obviously we don't have much offsuit right so very easy right if you miss pocket nines in this spot that doesn't come up often it's a 0.12 if small line is loose enough and button is loose enough you don't care if you miss ace 10 suited you don't care well if you miss every ace queen offsuit your don't care. Well, if you miss every ace-queen offsuit, your frequency is absolutely off. If you take every ace-queen offsuit, it will be fine again. So it's very easy but important to be precise, especially on the offsuit side. Not like, oh, he three-bet three times now, I take my king-jack offsuit now. We shouldn't do that. We need better reads than that. All right, so So cornerstones. For me, important for memorization to really transfer that knowledge over to postbox knowing your range is key i gave the example of understanding how a board of 10 10 deuce is different to a board of 8 8 deuce when we are let's say from the cutoff or when we are from the button. I can tell you from the button 8-8 deuce is something we can work with and 7-7 deuce maybe is slightly worse. I mean not that it changes gameplay so much but our understanding of which hands we are having which gives you always a good feeling. The more you understand the better you feel in game the more clear your get. Okay, the more we know about the upcoming spot, the more precise we need to be. This can be deeper in the game tree like the call for bet, like a standard for bet, or even that we know what comes up next. If this guy is only calling and never for betting. Beautiful. We take high equity hands and that's it. We can increase our range because we have great equity realization. We never need to three bet fold. We can go rather crazy. So something like that, understanding that. Then we can shift our range. We can build our range to our needs. And just the reminder, don't get offsuit wrong. Offsuituit is the key here and the other thing is your freestyle mix in your pocket fours and pocket fives and whatever mix in your king five suiteds if it's a mess up or not it's only a small one and not a high frequency so really really does not matter in the long run regarding your overall le. Okay, next thing. Preparation and domination. That sounds great somehow. Doesn't mean much more. Maybe one thing is interesting here. Preparation, we talked about that already. We want to prepare for what's coming next, right? Which spot are we getting in? Okay, so a little recap here regarding reaction game. We have that in the advanced coaching advanced pre-flop coaching that i told you i don't like you playing versus position when you have more information than that so i want you to play versus range right here we feel it in the chat it's a beautiful coaching today i think something else was it it Toby, is it today, dropped off that we have quite some MTG players in here today. For them, defending versus cutoff is a very different thing in their mind than for us defending versus cutoff. But if I tell them defending versus a 28% opening range, it's the same for everybody. So this is why I like whenever possible to just talk about a certain range. 28% is kind of a GTO cutoff range. This is why I took it now. We should have an image in our mind. Would be even better. Next homework. Try to nail down a 15% range, a 20% range, a 24, a 28, a 35, and get a feeling for what that is once we know that right i one of my second stats right i i added to my hut on sites where a hut is possible obviously back then it was or everything was fine was positional race first in it's very important i'm not playing versus under the gun. Some of the best players played 21% race first in from there, some other from the best players played 16%. It's yeah, 25% difference, right? Whether someone plays 16 or 25, it's a hell big of a deal regarding how often he has aces or kings. So yeah, very, very interesting. Whenever it's possible you want to do that, that's That's a little reminder. And MTTs, yeah, big thing there. It's not static, but for your interesting whenever it's possible you want to do that that's a little reminder the mtt is yeah big thing there it's not static but for your brain it's very helpful to think in those terms i would say obviously icm is a big factor and you can't just say that like cut off you should have that i'm more taking into account the deviations that people are doing loose players and tight players to really keep an eye on that and possible, not only say cutoff or button, in MTTs you have way more influences that can change that opening range. So it's really, really tough. You need to really, I'm lacking the word, you really need to find out the exact situation you are in. So yeah, preparation. Which spots will come up exploitatively, right? So how playing which hands perform best we talked about that already right with drone's question how i how do i adjust versus recreationals depends a lot on the recreation right if you're only calling and not overfolding too much but i can control in position i take high equity hands realize equity and play position and like to play bigger pots on average versus recreational versus someone who starts normal but then gets nitty well we can maybe flat even build a flatting range there and play rather polarized and and like move him off lots of hands um with with double and triple barrels and then my equity is less interesting actually and now the the most important thing where I think for lots of people is a big learning effect. Once you've understood your range or how a range is constructed you can make use of domination effects. Which hands do we want to play or play not against? This is the decision that we make. Again, we think about villains' range and gameplay in a way that it is static. Let's say this guy doesn't know us, he plays his game. And then we can decide, do we want to 3-bet and we make him fold certain hands? Do we want to call and keep certain hands in? And this is how we can influence domination effects. And this is something how I made a big boost in learning like three betting ranges, four betting ranges, and even can adjust them a little on the go, depending on the knowledge versus players. So I want to give you an example for that. Where is that? What happened here? Okay, in other words, maybe one more slide. I didn't remember I have this one. In the reaction game, board coverage, different words, it's preparation is nothing else but board coverage that we need to be prepared for what might be coming up. Domination is really we play hand versus range and this is a good term, make good stuff happen. Whenever we make good stuff happen, it's usually a good a good play and this can be different things and now we get to the example okay so example regarding the domination i think i didn't explain it so well so far so i use that example that you guys understand and now i want you to think about the borderline hands weak hands in a blind versus blind scenario. Let's say we force the small blind to play open race only, which happens most of the time in a cash game environment. I want you to think about which hands is villain always open raising. If you listen to this coaching carefully, you will start thinking about offsuit hands. And want you to think about offsuit hands. And now I want you to think about which of those hands is villain always folding to a three bet. So yeah, maybe someone wants to write something. I thought I'd just give you some time to think and I will show. So which hands is villain always open raising? Okay, so villain is openain is open raising every offsuit 9x and 10x. So that means ace 9, king 9, queen 9, jack 9, ten 9. Yes, all those offsuit combinations are open raises and they are all folding those. Which means they are folding ace 9 versus the three bet. King 9, queen 9, jack 9, ten 9. Yes, that's true. The ten x, I think there's i think there's some ace 10 maybe a tiny amount of king 10 four betting but all of those fold perfect low officer broadways exactly yeah that's kind of the same thing perfect so they are now we found the hands we found the hands that perfect answer, I think. And those that are always open raising and always folding to a 3-bet. And now the follow-up question is, which hands do profit the most from playing or not playing versus those hands? Let's take those hands that do not want to play versus those hands. That would make a great 3-bet, right? We don't want to play against those that are definitely open raising and that are definitely folding, which means if we three bet we get them out of the way. King-9 I think is bullshit because you want to play versus queen-9 and jack-9 and ten-9. Or are you just still referring to the first part? Then K9 is obviously right. We think in off-suit terms. Suited, we don't care. We need suited, I can tell you already, will never be a 3-bet, something like that. It's too strong to 3-bet and then fold to a 4-bet. Here we go. All right. K6 to fold out better. Right. Thank you. I can tell you already it will never be a 3-bet, something like that. It's too strong to 3-bet and then fold to a 4-bet. Here we go. All right, K6 to fold out better. Right, exactly. And now I give you a little hint. We go really from high card to high card. So which ace-axe are always... Now we go step by step. Which ace-axe are always open raising and always folding to a 3-bet? So Jerome's perfect answer, right? He knows that ace-2 and ace-3 in our world is not an open raise. So it's ace-4 through to ace-9, right? So Jerome can tell us the perfect ace-x we want to three bet them. And just think about it. Good stuff is happening because we won't need to play versus ace four and ace nine through to ace nine anymore. So ace three and ace deuce is the perfect answer here. All right. If someone knows we do the same for the King X now, which King X are always open raising again offsuit and always folding to a three bet. And this is now where it comes into play to know the correct and your open raising range right so baki knows that king eight offsuit is the line right king seven is not an open race and then the first hand that loves to get those out of the way is obviously who can give us the answer best best king x first king x and probably highest frequency king- at the same time is king seven offsuit so we can do the same for the queen x queen eight i can tell you is in my charts at least not an open race or a low frequency one so we talk about queen nine queen ten queen jack that are always open race folding so if we have queen eight we want to get those out of the way. So now we have our first, which looks random, our three betting range is built around A2, A3, K7, maybe some K6, Q8, maybe some Q7, J8 also, I would say, and maybe some 10-8, 10-9. And maybe if you follow that carefully or you click on the repeat button now re-watching the video maybe that helps you a little to really understand where a somewhat random range, let's have a look at the small blind open raising range we have the ace four plus, king eight plus, queen nine plus, jack nine-ish plus, plus 10-8, where our three betting range is coming from. From those hands, ace-deuce, ace-3, king-7, queen-8, jack-8, 10-7. Let's take a quick look how it looks like. Ace-deuce, ace-3, king-7 highest frequency, king-6, king-5, queen-8, Jack, J8 this year. So what we see is exactly the border of the open raising. Things go hand in hand. If you understand open raising, now you can understand 3 betting. The suited part here is kind of special, I would say. You can see it in the suited part. You can do the same thing for 4-x, 3-x and deuce-x, obviously, but now it gets more irrelevant, right? If you think about which 3-x are open raising, not a single offsuit one. So we go to suited, deuce-ex also it's queen deuce king deuce ace deuce queen deuce king deuce ace deuce 4x is jack queen king ace so yeah in my world it would be jack deuce jack 3 10 4 now in reality it's 10 deuce 10 3 10 4 which probably has to do with board coverage because we lack a little with our 10x 3 bets soets so far that we missed there a little or I don't know better right but the logic I think is good enough how much of effect there is to opening 2.5x versus 3 you will find a chart online I just don't know it's important well if you think about open raising a different size you need a charge a solver that ran for that amount. If you play versus someone open raising, it's not too interesting about the price. Obviously, you can adjust and call a little more and 3-bet a little more, but it's more important that you understand which range is he playing. Is he playing, this year should be like a 41% range, 43, something like that. Or is it? Small bind open raise 43. If someone is playing 2.5x, it's probably more like a 50 to 55% range. But this is a guess. I don't have the chart. Exactly. Yeah, Jerome, this is absolutely right. But this is kind of what I meant before. How about 3 betting way higher frequency versus recreations while knitting up against regs. The polarized part lives off fold equity so depends if you have recreationals recreational in my mind always triggers calling station against the calling station i'm definitely not three betting queen eight offsuit because they are not necessarily folding queen 10 offsuit so if that effect is not there it's a shit three bet and i'd rather take a hand that i think is just, like maybe the Q8 suited that Didi mentioned before, where we see like this part we're not really doing lots of 3-betting of that. This is more like a whatever part that can call a 4-bet. Then I prefer doing that because as a preparation I will see lots of flops. This is just what recreational triggers in me. So I want to have better the better hands in a bigger pot. I know just value have exactly. Yeah. Okay. Right. And then you see like some of those, I hope you understood now where, especially those offsuit, it's important that you understand how much more important this side is than this side. Understanding you take some suited Kings, some suited aces is totally enough, whether it's ace five or ace four, absolutely no one cares. Whether this 10-6 is necessary in here, who freaking cares? So it's really more everything you know about villain is more important here. Okay, I hope that is interesting here. Maybe one more question, because this can help you in every freaking scenario let's say it's very easy yeah button open raises small by three bets small by three bets what is our button four betting range build around right so again i think about those hands that villainous three betting for sure and then folding for sure right so here it would be villainous definitely 3-betting A-jack, also lots of A-10, it's a plus. He is 3-betting every K-Q and almost every K-J. So let's say we focus on off-suit side again, A-jack, K-J, A-10. First thing that comes to mind, a hand that I want to be playing is KJ, something like that maybe, right? KJ to get that out of there, like some 10x maybe, some A9 maybe. So let's just see that three bets, this is a fold. And we should see that, that KJ, some A10, exactly those hands. This suited part here, A8, eight some ace nine it's always just that border that that wins from of that right so we have before cutoff versus hijack three bet quick example also here 100 three bets ace jack and king queen what is your first instinct now i want everyone who is still following i'm very proud of you it's a lot of talking everyone who is still following who can tell me the inst like quick instinct first instinct for bed from the hijack we want to make good things happen miguel goes for the king jack offsuit for bed we we fold kinguit, but we'll choose the King-Jack suited if you guys are fine with it. Ace-Queen is something else. So the first one, Ace-Queen is a high frequency forebet as well for different reasons. So here we see the King-Jack suited. We just can't take hands to forebet. The King-Jack suited is higher than the ace-jack king and we see it's a preparation it's a wild mix but the king-jack is so natural now after what we've learned right then three bets every king queen three bets every ace jack we can't hold king-jack suited so we can choose do we call it and play versus those high frequency offsuit hands or do we just freaking four bet and get them out of the way as well as maybe different good thing we four bet and at the same time we get ace king out of the way sounds stupid because ace king is mainly jamming but still we don't need to play anymore against that which is a good thing right we play against tens and nines and ace queen suited we do fine against that the ace queen for bad is also it's dominating all that suited part which is a good effect and it's also good in a way because we get rid of ace king it's really that it's a weird thought but if we forbear the villain jams ace king and we don't need to play against that anymore. Which you see, if you understand the correct way, it's an upside, even though you just four bet fold. But yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's a helpful way of thinking. Okay. So this, those domination effects, once you understand open raising ranges, it will get way easier to understand 3-betting ranges. So here that small line versus big line example was for me a couple of years ago just a big, big, big eye-opener to understand that this is not Brandon. Not at all. And even if you know more about your villain's opening range, if you see he has 48% first hand or maybe is crazy or super tight, you can adjust. It's about the hands that he open raises always and always folds. You can benefit from that. All right. Cool. I think, I hope that explained that well, example nomination. And we are here, we are just five minutes over key takeaways. I think was, I hope it was a nice session. Something lots of talking by my side. Great. Thank you for the questions, especially Didi, Jerome doing great job. Jerome doing some great homework. And now coming to the key takeaways. Preflop is like doing homework. So now we can count that session as a homework, right? And you can go play now. But tomorrow I want to see you back at homework. I hope you understood how cornerstones or you take the rectangle like diddy. It's in the end, the same thing. Help you memorize ranges. Helps you transfer things over to postflop. You can take a friend, ask yourselves questions about ranges, right? What is your offsuit line doing this and that here, right? Which board is better for you? Is it the king eight deuce, king nine deuce? Does it make a difference on the offsuit side? Always about that understand preparation what is happening next especially on the exploitative side is villain always three betting is always more than he should right is he always calling like a freaking fish just seeing a flop and make use make us make use this is this is how i quickly prepare those actually i reread the freaking presentation just on the last slide. Make use of domination. I hope that is like the hopefully the most eye-opening one in the end, how all things go hand in hand. The open raising range leads to the three betting range, the three betting range leads to the four betting range. Still, villains do not need to play like the book or like us. So we need to evaluate how they are actually playing. But I want you to understand that you are really choosing the hands you're playing against. You are choosing. It's not, oh, he three bet me again. No, it's that he got a hand to three bet with. But you are choosing whether you defend your 10-7 offsuit passively, get outkicked on a 10 high board, or you play the three bet, get all that shit out of the way, and actually hitting a 10 then is worth way more. If he has ace-10 and king-10 suited, so be it. But this is just a big game changer to really understand that, which makes your frequencies and your ranges a little better. All right, so let me see. Does all this apply when playing in low stakes like NL10 or NL25? Absolutely, especially for you, most important that you learn your ranges. Once you got those, you can adjust so much because people are playing relatively shit on NL10 and nl25 so lots of things to adjust but first you need your starting point you need to understand your ranges that's that's kind of the key so thanks glad that you liked it back here gonna do homework ryan let's go and here we go for questions comments after the session there is a channel perfect they call the hands that should fold in the view of those three betting hands that are weaker chains. Exactly right. So maybe for you, especially, Dante, go back to the simple preflop and the advanced preflop session. If you struggle a little there and start with a simple preflop once you did enough homework that you know your ranges. And I think at L10 and25 you do that well uh would just guess so you go to the advanced part and you start maybe you find some live plays i did a couple of live plays every decision revealed where i talk in depth about every preflop decision whether i go one pip wider or one pip tighter stuff like that um and you get a feeling for how can adjust already pre-flop having little information about your builds and then you come back and watch that one more time here but actually this is this is not this is not more than the advance it's just i try to help a little with the memorization or like putting my thoughts out there how you can maybe improve your pre-flop game little. So yeah, as always, feel free to ask any questions in the channel. And here, sorry for the late question. Perfect. What do you mean with your ranges? You can write down your ranges. You play your ranges. You make the decisions in game which hands you are playing. You can decide whether you are the guy open raising King-9 offsuit from the cutoff or not can write it down all of them are fine we started the simple pre-flop session with actually googling charts and i told you all of them that i found were fine from different friendly poker courses we also know or whatever whoever puts something out there and they were slightly different it's just like all of them were different and i tried to explain to you that in the end they are all the same and it's about you knowing which one you take i want you once you are in a spot post flop i want you to know whether you have deuces through two fives in your opening range or not you can't make it up that's so i want your decision you can write it down what you you play, and you stick to it for the next 20,000 hands. It's fine. I always thought back then it's a big game changer. What can I change? I had a study buddy on NL100 who played more loose in full ring because he was playing from the first positions. Ace-2suce to ace-5 suited and thought like, oh I do that as well now, then I'm crushing. He was crushing and I was somewhat playing break even at that point and this was the only difference I found. Obviously he just made better post-flop decisions and playing ace-deuce or ace-5 suited from those positions in a certain environment doesn't matter at all, which I understand now, but back then that was the only thing I found. So yeah. Are you going 100% with GTO range and just apply tables a bit? I try to adjust as much as possible, but only if I have information. It's a big game of collecting information. Before you stick to your guns, that you know what you're doing because you can't know what others are doing. That's the game changer, that you can evaluate your range how it does on a certain board, that you can evaluate that's great. If you're freaking tight and you're never open raising low pockets from earlier positions, maybe 3-5-6 is a really shitty board for you and you should know. All right, cool. Family just coming home right now. I sent them out of here for that hour. So it was pretty quiet here. That was great. Last time it was freaking noisy. So yeah, I'll cut you off. And yeah, happy to receive more questions in the chat that Miguel opened. I'll talk to you in Discord. See you soon. Bye bye, guys.
