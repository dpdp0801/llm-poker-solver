### TOPIC: cash preflop raise first in exploits
 This video is about the potential exploits we can implement already when raising first n. In the last video about the fundamentals when raising first n we've learned that we are interested in two parameters. One of them being the race size we are using. I'm just using a one in each position. Another one is the amount of hands we want to put in that open racing range, the frequency we are open racing with. So these are two elements we can work on when we decide to go for an exploitative preflop play. The next question would be when do we want to make those exploitative preflop plays? What to focus on? And I made a little list here. First of all is how many players are still involved? How much sense does it make to exploit a certain read we might be having? Second thing is how passive or aggressive will the opponents behind me react to my open raise? We've learned already the trade-off between putting out dead money and setting certain odds. Next one would be how wide are they defending? Are they playing a wide and weak range or are they only playing a tight range which means they are folding very often preflop. And when talking about where those starting hands charts come from, we had a look at postflop edge as well. Who is playing better? Am I making better decisions postflop which gives me a good chance to open raise more hands profitablyflop, or is villain actually making better decisions and I'm actually happy with folding close stuff? And to explain that a little better, I come back to the example I used in the fundamentals. How do we want to adjust there? I made a small change. Let's start with example number one. We open raise under the gun again or let's say we think about open raising. MP, three bets, whatever my chart says. Cutoff does the same. Button, not this time because we have very aggressive button and I know that his range is clearly wider than the 9% he should be 3 betting and my guess is he is around 13%. Small blind stays the same, big blind stays the same. So now the chance of facing a 3-bet after open raising for us increased from 33 to 36 percent. That's like a 10 percent move up in frequency. Let's have a look at example number two. There we open raise the button. Small line stays the same at three bets 15%. The big blind now is somewhat nitty and three bets only eight percent instead of the 14 he should. So that has quite a dramatic influence on the overall three bets we are facing. we are getting three bet only 22 percent instead of 27 right and it's not about the five percent difference here it's the relative difference it's over 20 percent decrease here so this is very interesting which is the spot where we can exploit more let's have a look at that and go step by step through the individual things. How many players are still involved? First spot, five players still involved. I have a read on one of them so that should already tell me hey more players I cannot exploit too much. So first thing to keep in mind here, the more players are still in, the less I can exploit. Second thing. Okay, how aggressive, passive will they react? In example number one, people where the button was more aggressive than he should be. So we have two ways to exploit that. We can either decrease our sizing to put less dead money out there or we can decrease our frequency which means less hands that we are open raise folding. Two ways to exploit that. Both is totally fine. Next question, how wide are they defending, did not really take place in example number one. And what about postflop edge was not in there? Let's have a look at example number two. How many players are still involved? Two players, just the small blind and the big blind. Remember, I open raised the button. Small blind stays the same and the big blind, we have a nitty player who doesn't 3-bet enough. So we can focus on him and go for lots of exploits. This is the spot where I want to be really exploitative and widen my range. How aggressive or passive will they react? We didn't talk about his calling range. Maybe he's calling all the time or he's just folding a lot. if he is doing the first, I like to still use a big sizing because that money is not that important. He is not three betting often enough. So if he is folding a lot, I might think about increasing my risk reward. Just min raising now with a very very very wide range. Alright, how wide are they defending? I was already talking about that and what about post-flop edge that was not in there. But we'll talk about that in general. The wider people defend, the more I want to build a pot when I have an advantage. The weaker players are the more I want to invite them to play against me. I want to increase or decrease the price. If I know someone is folding all the time I want to min raise because this really is his pain point. This is like okay he would like to fold if I 5x now he's allowed to fold a lot If he likes to call a lot Well, I don't give him the right price and if he ends up calling his king-8 offsuit against 5x That's great for me as well So always think about what to focus on and what the right exploit will be given a certain situation And the next thing I want to do is to look at my favorite spot to start exploiting preflop. A certain setting that is just perfect for open raising with a little different strategy. But first let me summarize maybe again how I do it in high stakes games, in tough games. The earlier my position, the further I am away from the big blind and have more people in between that usually focus on three betting when defending or playing their hand. That means I'm not that interested in giving bad odds. I'm focusing on not putting out too much dead money. That means the earlier my position is smaller my open race. The later we go cutoff button that changes because actually I'm just playing versus the blinds in the end which means mainly I'm interested in the big blind and I don't want to give him the best odds in the world and which we have seen in the example the amount of three bets I'm facing will decrease so I can care less about dead money there which means I'm operating bigger from later positions and the setting I want to talk about now is so interesting because everything is just turned around in a way. And let me show you first where we are heading. We are playing live poker now. And I just wrote down three classic reads I have on pretty much any live poker table. I don't know how true they are in your personal game, but most of the time they will be right. So people in live poker are playing their hands passively. People like calling and seeing flops. Very general statement. Second thing, people are actually too loose pre-flop sitting there all day getting dealt a hand like king 10 off on the button facing a 3x open race from under the gun feels playable for some people obviously we have our john rocks reading the newspaper as well just waiting for jacks plus maybe queens plus who knows but yeah in general there are lots of people who like to see flops and are actually too loose not really thinking about the price and the most important thing actually people play poorly post flop in live poker they are fun players they are players who didn't train that much online and know every spot how it works. They are there for the fun or they are whatever regular live poker players. So yeah, let's go step by step and think about what the right exploits will be given every single read. And the first thing, people are playing their hands passively pre-flop. That means that I don't care too much about dead money anymore. So I can size up from earlier positions because I'm not facing so many 3-bets. People are not really 3-betting pocket 8s, cutoff versus NP, where they are queen-jack suited all the time. They are in general flatting more of those hands which will decrease three bet frequency which makes me realize more equity with weaker hands as well all right and i can open raise loser in late positions actually as well people will three bet less so i realize more equity which means even the weakest hands are not the weakest but like the weaker hands can still make some ev all right second thing people are way too loose that first of all means i don't want to be too loose from earlier positions. That will bring in multi-way situations where I'm out of position. That's not great for me. I don't want to open raise my 7-9 suited, whatever, if people are flatting all king-jack offs in the world. So how I want to exploit that is, when I have strong ranges, I want to size up because people are not caring about the sizing too much. Thank you. So how I want to exploit that is when I have strong ranges, I want to size up because people are not caring about the sizing too much. And that's the same thing. Pretty much I want to build a pot when I know I have equity advantage. That means tighter ranges from early position, sizing up, getting to play a pot with something like queens and jacks and Tens versus all their King-10 off suits and playing a big pot. That's the dream. Next thing, people play poorly postflop. That means I can play more hands and at the same time depending on the spot I want to invite them to play. I can play more hands and at the same time, depending on the spot, I want to invite them to play. I can increase my risk reward or make it more favorable for me that I risk less to get into the spot where I will play postflop against poor opponents. I want to do that especially in position because there I will have more pulse flop edge because I can yeah I'm just in position right we all know that this is pretty great. So yeah how does that change my overall strategy? I stay tight from earlier positions because I still play versus x amount of uncapped ranges and they will have it, right? And they flat too much and force me to play out of position with weaker hands if I'm open raising them. That's not my goal. So I will open raise bigger from earlier positions with a normally tight range. And then going to later positions. Well, I'm actually not caring about the odds i'm giving the big blind too much anymore because i actually want him to play with me if i say i have the clear pulse flop edge can obviously be different from big blind to big blind but in general and i can loosen up at the same time because people are not three betting enough which means I realize equity plus I have post flop edge so actually exactly the other way around compared to how I play online versus really good players let that sink in maybe and now wrap the session up I tried to show you the potential exploits you're having and what to focus on. What can people potentially be doing wrong and what is the perfect exploit against that. And now I hope you go out there and yeah check out the live video that is provided here where I will focus on exactly those spots. And in your next session, make sure to find spots where you can change your preflop strategy from just chart poker to exploitative poker when it makes sense.
