### TOPIC: cash preflop raise first in fundamentals
 This video is about the first step you might be making when you're playing a hand of poker. We'll be talking about the raise first in. The fundamentals of it. What is important? What are we looking at? What are our goals doing that? What should we keep an eye on? How to use something like starting hands chart? How to evaluate them? This and more we'll talk about in this video. Let us really start from scratch and think about what do we need to think about building our very first open raising ranges? Well, first of all, we need sizings, one or multiple that we use. And then we need to think about how do they affect every other player on the table. On the one hand, we are giving odds to players to play with us. On the other hand we are putting out dead money, especially when we think about the weaker part of our range that will always fall to three bets. And then we need to think about how many hands do we want to play in each position, which range is profitable depending on the position and the players behind? So we are talking about two parameters. One, the sizing. I'll keep it easy, let's use just one sizing that we decide. And the second thing, the frequency we are raising, the range we are playing. Let's talk a little more about the first problem, the sizing. What is the perfect one there? So whenever we choose sizing, we are setting odds for our villains. And this is the price they are getting to see a flop when they think about calling or this is the risk reward we are putting out there for them to think about 3-betting. So odds mainly will talk about people that are thinking about calling. The other part is more putting the dead money out there. So who is interested in calling? Probably everyone. But what is the main difference between opening 2x or 3x or four times the big blind? Well actually the biggest effect it has on odds is for the big blind who already has one big blind out there. So this is something to keep in mind when talking about odds we're mainly thinking about the big blind. Okay, the other part is the dead money. Every time we open raise with a hand that needs to fold versus action we are putting out dead money so we don't want to give great risk rewards to our opponents so if we race big with a large range and they three bet and we fold all the time well that's not making us money in the long run so if people are just calling that's not the biggest issue. To make that a little clearer I prepared a little example for you. And I call that the big trade-off. We want to give villains bad odds to give them a chance to be folding or pay money with bad hands but we don't want to put out too much dead money at the same time this is why I call it the big trade-off and it depends on the situation which sizing fits a little better so let's go through those two examples example number one is we open raise under the gun. Let's say middle position three bets about 7.5%, cutoff about 8%, button 9%, small blind 7.5% and big blind 6.5%. Those are certain charts that I'm having and using here. That means that on total, and don't get confused by the number, it's not just adding those numbers up, we have a chance of someone 3-betting us of 33%. So when we open raise under the gun, it's quite likely that we face a 3-bet. The second example is we open raise the button and the small blind has a typical three betting range of 15% if you place three bet only, something like that. And the big blind in my charts should be three betting about 14%. So we face a total three bet of 27% only. And this is where we see the trade off on the left side. Example number one, we face more three bets and probably get less calls. Obviously depends on how the players in between are playing and that changes a lot so I didn't want to put down frequencies here. I'm playing threebet only from three of those positions that matter, so I'm not expecting too many calls there. But I expect clearly less calls from the big blind versus under the gun compared to example number two. The big blind will mainly answer by calling versus a button open raise. So So this leads me to my first idea already that the earlier my position is, the higher the chance that overall I might face a three bet. The less I wanna put that money out there. And the later my position, the more it is just about the big blind, the one who is interested in odds the most, Thank you. And the later my position, the more it is just about the big blind, the one who is interested in odds the most, and me. So I focus on that and I do not care too much about the dead money anymore. So let's just summarize that once more. The more we expect calls, the more we should focus on odds we are giving, which means we should size up. Dead money is not a problem then, and we want to give them bad odds and a chance to make mistakes, expensive mistakes. The more we expect our opponents to answer our open race with a three bet the more we should focus on the dead money which means not putting out too much dead money we want a size down let me give you two extreme examples if people are just calling falling. is not allowed i definitely want to use a bigger open raise size than just 2x or 3x maybe even bigger than that and the other example should be even more clear if people are just answering by three betting and they are not allowed to be calling well i actually maybe i even want to limp i don't know right i want to race to the minimum which is well 2x but i would like to go even less right so yeah this is just the risk reward that i want to have as good as possible for me. And now let's have a look at the first range I'm presenting to you. So I'm just showing you this is my under the gun range. And I know every one of you is looking for a starting hands chart, etc. And all-solved stuff whatever this is the one that i'm using i didn't solve that myself did a buddy for me and yeah this is how it looks like for zoom 500 and yeah let's just have a look on how I read those charts and memorize them. So first step is offsuit hands. Those are the ones that matter because of the amount of combinations. I always want to know in every position what is the weakest offsuit hand I'm open raising. when the ranges get a little wider, I think even about all the specific high cards. What's my weakest offsuit ace, weakest offsuit king, etc. Here I just know that it's ace-ten and I don't think about it. But king-jack, is that already a frequency thing or is that a 100% thing? This is something I want to know. Second step is step is what about the pairs five percent deuces six percent threes twelve percent fours whatever okay and then we get to the suited stuff everything I remember here is like yes suited connector are like whatever suited aces obviously and then there's like the nine I'm always looking for those lines right where it's like king nine always queen nine always ten nine almost always that's enough and the other stuff as a mix or not but i'm and you can hear it maybe already i'm not a big fan of those charts because they have some problems with it. And to show you that, I actually want to show you some other ranges I just found by doing Google research. So what we see here is the same spot, just other first in ranges and i hope you remember the cornerstones of the range that we have in mind now right it was ace 10 off 100 king jack off pocket sevens was the first pocket peer to go 100 open raise then, well, the suited connector sometimes in that line with the nines, king nine, queen nine, jack nine suited, something like that. So let's have a look here. Three charts. I'll start with the first one. That looks quite similar, but king jack off only raises half of the time. It has the the nine line as well with the suited hands with the pockets it goes sixes plus and the others are like 50 the lower ones but remember in my chart pocket deuces were only like five percent this is the first one let's have a look at the second one that actually uses a second color here to show which are well on the edge and you should only open raise when it's a little looser. So I like that a lot. But what we see here is pocket fives always. King jack always. Deuces, threes, low frequency. hmm and then the third one king jack off never ever force threes deuces never but pocket fives a hundred percent it seems like this is not mixing at all and five six suited is an open race but never four five and never seven six and the suited niner line never just ten nine okay so something is a little different there, the third one is a little tighter. But now I want to explain to you what I think about those charts and how we should see them because I can give you that answer right away. All of them are fine. I could play any of those, right? It's just a baseline, the foundation of everything that is coming and to get a better idea of that we should look where those charts come from back in the days we have been just testing things out thinking about calling ranges and what happens here and there if we do this or that, or just did database reviews to just see, okay, those hands were profitable for us in the past and others maybe not. And that was all of it. Nowadays, we have way more possibilities to figure things out right we can run solvers, for example. We can have a certain input. We give them and let them calculate, but we should understand how that works. So they have a certain framework of preflop sizings that we offer, and they are limited to run the calculations with that. Then they will run it through a certain subset of flops that represents all the flops there are which is fine but not the whole show. But even more important they have a certain framework post-flop maybe one flop size maybe two maybe three but something and this is all they can work with but and that is important as well they will given that framework execute strategies perfectly so this is lots of stuff that doesn't sound like anywhere close to what is really happening at the table. So let me show you now the list of things that need to happen that those charts actually make sense in the real world. Let's think about what does the chart show. It usually marks in color all profitable open raises. If villain plays perfectly preflop, given the certain framework. Villain number one, number two, number three, number four, number five. All of them have to play as good as possible as the solver would suggest given that framework. Not only regarding the sizings, but as well, the certain framework works for sizes of the blinds. It's like sometimes there's small blind 5 and big blind 10. It can be 10 and 25 as well. So different in a there we can talk about anti rake structure every time different this is something that could change then we need our villains to play perfectly post-flop again given the certain framework we are having and now the most important point probably we need to play perfectly post-flop as well and only if all of this is somewhat true what the chart shows us is actually true as well so i guess we can say already that there's there's yeah those charts will never nail it because there's so much stuff that won't be true at all and this is our job to evaluate that and make up our mind that means we need to think about which mistakes are villains doing how is that framework different from the one that chart was made for? How close to optimal do my villains play in that setting? How good can I play? And we can maybe combine the last two to who has edge. Obviously that has huge influence on how many hands i can play so to wrap that up i want to say hey what is the goal of charts how can we use them i don't want to say they are bad right they are a perfect baseline that we know our range that's the main thing and again there is not a perfect chart there are a lot of good ones out there if you put in six max cash game starting hands chart i guess the first that comes up is is a free one from upswing poker for example that's totally fine if you understand how to read those charts it is a baseline to deviate from and what is the most important thing it is the foundation of your game you will build on that and remember how i presented my first chart today it is important for you to know the cornerstones of your range it's not important whether you raise king jack off 60 or 40 or even never but i want you to know your range for post flop you can take the tightest if you feel comfortable there and go with sevens plus i want you to know that your range is sevens plus so you won't do too much on three five six right and this is what we will build on post flop build your own ranges think about it think about how strong you are compared to the players around you. Take a chart that you find on Google. It's totally fine. But I want you to understand what it is for.
