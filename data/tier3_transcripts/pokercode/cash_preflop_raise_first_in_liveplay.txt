### TOPIC: cash preflop raise first in liveplay
 Welcome to the very first live play I'm doing to showcase you one of the spots we talked about in theory a little more. This one is about the raise first in the start of the hand. So as you might see already I have a HUD open with very very basic stats. We see VPIP, PFR, 3-bet, fold to 3-bet, and the bottom line is the raise first in values from each position, from early position on the very left side to the small blind as the last one on the very right side. I'll try to really focus on building those raise first in ranges. Maybe talk a little about the pre-flop theory overall and yeah don't want to get too distracted even though if interesting spots might be coming up i know this is always interesting but i want to keep that topic related and talk about this very first decision. So first I want to give you my basic strategy. I will start open raising small from early position, middle position and cutoff with a 2.2 big blind hotkey I'm having. I will open raise from the bottom with 2.5 big blinds and I will open raise from the small blind with three big blinds and i will adjust two villains if necessary my first adjustment we are playing zoom 200 today will be to be a little looser than the charts that you can find online because remember remember that charts are not a given thing. They are showing you which hands are profitable, if everyone plays perfectly preflop, if villain plays perfectly postflop, if you play perfectly postflop. So this is the first baseline I try to loosen up a little because against most of the players on Zoom 200 I give myself pulse flop edge. And here I might even change that from time to time when I think okay maybe there's a specifically weak spot in the big blind or on the button and then I will comment on that. So enjoy it and let's try to get the most out of that and run well at the same time. So very interesting already, top right, king eight off is one of those chart lines where like king seven off is a fold, king nine off is 100% open raise. I will definitely go for it. Ace-9 suited, top left, nothing to think about. And I'll just play post-flop a little. Obviously, the pocket queens down there, cold four bet. I decide to just jam that board. It's super interesting as well, but it's not the topic the topic for today top left i'm definitely calling that three bet and bottom left we see me open raising pocket force which in most charts is already just a frequency open race we have an unknown pretty much in the big blind so i like to be a little lighter anyways we have a knit player to my very left from what I can see from his stats so far. So I hope it's not... I tried to get as many hands in to have spots to talk about. I hope it's not too much to follow the action. Yeah that's the first try let's see how it goes 6-4 suited is a little too wide uh i don't find a specific spot at the table to really go for it here uh might be a thing ace three off from the cutoff same thing i would sometimes open raise like ace eight off ace five off are the first ones that I add to normal range. And yeah. Here, bottom left. Don't want to talk too much about post-flop. I might still be winning versus deuce-axe of spades and some nut flush draws. But I like that spot here a lot. And I just go for a bluff. I'm over-bluffing here, that's not the topic today, just like the spot. So no question here. Bottom right ace-10 off is 100% open raise from under the gun from middle position. Offsuit aces makes a big difference so still ace-9 off wouldn't make the cut here. Now we have the first big blind defense. I will have another live play video where I especially look at the big blind defense and talk about building the defending range and then splitting it into three bet and call so don't worry if I don't explain all of that in this one and here. Top left ace-7 off, a pretty clear one, right? Charts will show you ace-4 off is kind of the baseline. So I would go with any offsuit ace because I want to stay a little looser, not even close here. Versus a three bet five seven off nothing we can do Queen four off let's talk about first in Queen nine would be the line first in here pretty much so I would go with queen eight against that specific player 100 hands no real info his stats look fine so far calling those trips him over bluffing insanely with that ace jack so happy about that any suited ace from under the gun is definitely fine, sometimes ace-2 suited you can leave away but yeah I need a reason for that. Alright so this is the first spot where I really see I have 400 hands on the player in the big blind, green marked already on the top left. I would go way wider here. this is i always when i open raise from under the gun or middle position i have my eyes open for the button and for the big blind those are the people i'm playing against and him over folding pre-flop or being a knit in general tells me well he's folding post-flop a lot as well just gives my weaker hands more ev right my weak hands benefit from him just folding now snap call and yes yeah um i will go for the double barrel just to fold out hands that dominate me i don't expect him to check all king queen ace highshigh too often twice so that works out well. So and another thing that I tried to explain in the Theo video, let's have a look at the bottom right. There I did open raise on a table where everyone has reasonable stats on the sample I'm having maybe this cutoff has even the knit tag that that color is my knit tag 1916 so far yeah I wouldn't change my base strategy but I want to know my baseline this is important and yeah knowing that baseline is something I want you to know as well. It does not matter how your baseline looks like exactly, but I want you to know in that spot, do you have king 10 offsuit or do you fold that preflop? Do you have king jack 100% frequency or just sometimes? How do you play pocket sevens? Do you always have it? Right so now I think this is close whether I have a value raise. I think I can go for a thin value raise here after checking back the turn with that hand and he has the river pocket sevens and is just calling which is um yeah I mean lucky him that I went for the thin value raise but this is is obviously not the play he should be doing too often. Just yeah, most of the time I'm calling all my king X and he just gets the minimum value out of that. That was a little misplay from him I would say. And so here another thing I talked about is the later our position is, the less players we are playing against and the more we can think about exploiting. So if I was first in on the top left, seeing that 19-15 guy, never 3-betting pretty much, 4.6 is his 3-bet, I would think about changing my strategy to a very, very wide range with a small sizing. I might even go to a hundred percent and just two and a half x. I have to just go for the maximum exploit against someone who just does not want to play apparently. So that would have been a very very massive exploit that I can do when I'm in the small blind first end. This would never work if I'm in earlier positions still playing versus four or five players then I can have as many reads as you want. I cannot adjust that much. Okay this is quite interesting. I'll actually start bluffing this one here. Okay king-fi off, not close. King-queen off again. I know this is 100% in my opening range here. If you want to be super tight you can leave it. But yeah so just it's about knowing. Again I open-raise here. If the board is ace- is ace king queen I know that I don't have jack ten offsuit. I know that I have this and that and other things maybe not. So that tells me as well how to why do I need to defend in three versus three bets. What is my range here? Do I want to over fold or not? King queen off? Well it's not bottom of my range but it's very very far down there. Jack-5 off, here we see it, I have just top right guys, I have 156 hands on that guy, he plays 11-8 with 3.7% 3-bet. So what I'm doing is he even had the auto snap fold on on you've seen that how how fast he snapped i was now my strategy was now well a huge exploit going to 100 open race with 2.5 x so the two parameters i was talking about in the video about fundamentals um i was talking about in the video about fundamentals that uh i i changed both of them often I'm just deviating one here I change frequency and sizing because I want to go really massive and bottom right here it's not raised first in but I'm reacting to it's just 42 hands but 23 15 and no three bets so far just. Just against a tight player on the button as well. Just tells me, okay, I stay a little tighter here as well. And don't go high frequency with my ace-queen offsuit with a cold 4-bet. And yeah. Here I'm mixing on the top right. 4-betting and calling. Actually, I prefer calling a little more given the stack death. Deuce-8 off right against that super knit player from before on the bottom right. I would have open raised that obviously against a somewhat reasonable rack with somewhat reasonable stats. I'm not going that crazy. Calling my jacks here. That turn card I can donk sometimes if I want. If he did bet the flop on the bigger side that would make more sense. Now I'm improving to some sevens, to some 7a, to some 6-7, but he has more flushes actually. Definitely not donking with my hand. And yeah, this is just reaction game, right? He's building his, he might fire ace king again and I have jacks with the spades are a call, jacks without a spade are a fold and just got to follow, know my range and got to follow what my hand tells me here. Okay, now getting into a couple of post-flop spots again here. Bottom left is interesting. Just 56 hands. Let's not think about that too much. But let's say this 20-15 is given. So queen-9 offsuit would be my line. Against him, I would probably just go a little wider. Queen-7 for sure. Queen-4 is a little too weak, I feel like. But bottom right, Jack-2 suited is a clear exploit. Here, I'm not changing sizing. I just go with a wider range just because of the knit in the big blind. 19-15. No 3-bet means more equity realization. For me, I'm seeing more flops. I mean not not seeing more flops because he's folding even more but yeah he's defend if he's defending he's defending passively so I see the flop I realize equity and that boosts the view of that specific hand okay queen 10 off clear flat okay now interesting thing, I mean this is big blind defense now and we'll talk about that a little more in the other video. Pocket queens facing a 3-ax open. That tells me more dead money out there. He still has reasonable range so I want to defend more aggressively here actually, even though it looks stronger. But I have lots of hands on him so I pretty much know his range and I mean given the three bet before me I'm definitely cold for betting here ready to get it in a couple of post flop spots right now top left clear call top right against the super knit right I just put him on aces kings i would fold my probably just fold my king jack suited right but this is one of the best hands to crack something like that right if he has 10 8 player with three percent three bet i mean what is his range and then i need to take hands that beat that range um so yeah now top left choosing sizing to get rid, play it like queen jack and king jack, make ace king ace queen fold which is pretty important for my exact hand and then having a river decision if I don't hit and yeah. Checking back is totally fine as well. That ace, I mean how many ace highs am i stabbing on the turn not too many actually none of my draws i've queen 10 i've whatever but actually the ace decreases my value hands right obviously it looks like a scare card he might fold his jack 10 now his pocket 10s is 9x but i cannot value bet my king jack anymore um yeah it's close you can have ace x of spades i don't like that card so i'll i'll not bluff that here ace jack of spades yeah that's fine right let's focus on pre-flop again bottom right we have the super knit player and i mark him as a knit uh now 11 8 so i'm definitely definitely i could even go to a min race but i don't want if there are more people involved i don't like that too much because it's kind of telling everyone hey i'm exploiting something here um and yeah so i just like to keep going and now i can think about that right it's i'm not playing like cutoff versus big blind ranges i know that he's freaking tight so i expect him to hit that board quite a lot but i think him playing that style will play poorly and just mainly check calling etc so i just bet that one and try to check it down later and yeah he probably had pocket sevens right okay same same exploit all over the place bottom right 27 hands 13-4 are enough for me to go with king three off so um i wouldn't go with a hundred percent That is not enough hands for me there. And yeah, but an offsuit king, how bad can it be? If someone is clear, I mean, 27 hands not really participating is already quite something. 10-8 suited bottom left. We have a knit on the button on a very small sample. That doesn't mean too much. We have a nitty player in the big blind so i definitely wanted to open raise and just timed out that's all fine okay let's see king seven. We can three bet that sometimes. Seven, eight suited, bottom right, clear, open raise. So again, trying to summarize that a little. I have lots of easy decisions here when it just comes to raising first in because i know my ranges more or less and it's important for you to know your range charts are as explained in the fundamentals video right is not correct or anything it depends on lots of other factors as well choose your very own baseline and learn that one but just just you need to know it for postflop. I want you to know which hands you're having and then what you have seen here in the live play as well is hey the later my position the crazier I can go with exploits. We have seen a small bind ne2 open raise switching to two to 2.5x, we have seen looser button open raises. Then even small adjustments from earlier positions where I just go one pip wider or smaller. See what we do up here again. Top right, where I just... Oh, this is interesting here. Bottom left, I'm actually just calling because he's such a nit. I'm not playing versus a small bind first in range. I am playing versus the 25% I'm seeing here. Maybe it's a little wider. It's not many hands. But he plays 18-14-4 overall. So my 7-8 suited. I don don't want to three bet that just all the time right i'm just well actually yeah i need more stats to to know more about that but um he just has it very very often there so yeah so uh where where was i i was talking about small adjustments i made from earlier positions, especially keeping an eye on the button and on the big blind, the two key players that I might be playing against. The MP and Cutoff are mainly playing 3-bet only probably. They cannot deviate their ranges too much, so I know exactly what to to expect there and now bottom right looking for exactly the button is a little tight the big blind seems a reasonable player so it's close but i'm going with it that's just the the one pip wider i'm talking about king jack i'm always open raising king 10 i'm thinking about depending on the situation um obviously i'm fine if he 3-bets, he has something. And yeah let's take the bottom left as the last hand probably. And hopefully win another stack here. Jamming can be a thing here. Just thinking about what do I do. I don't want to fold out his king 10 of hearts so Jamming can be a thing here. Just thinking about what do I do. I don't want to fall out his king ten of hearts. So there's nothing that calls me that I have beat really. So I don't like the jam actually. I'd rather take other kind of drawing hands there. And yeah, kind of hit that river. Obviously not making the nuts, but pretty happy with that let's let's go obviously jamming should be enough reason for him to catch sometimes yeah well sweating this one let me say, I hope. You've seen a little how I try to apply, perfect rubber, how I try to apply the theory I talked about here in-game. So, again, what you open raise exactly, where you draw your line from under the gun and MP does not matter. Whether you open raise 43, 45, 48 or 40% from the button does not matter. Way more important is that you know your range for post flop. If you don't have the low pocket peers from under the gun, don't go crazy on a board where those hit make sets. This is just the learning process we need to know know your range and then the later our position or mainly the less players are behind us the more we can exploit small blind first in being a special position just playing versus one specific opponent button in, sure looking at the small blind as well but the big blind is our key player. And from earlier positions looking a little button versus big blind but there's just no room still playing versus five players or four players so we only deviate very very yeah with tiny steps pretty much yeah now go out try it yourself ask the question in questions in slack in our cash game content channel come up with your own strategies there ask again why you think things make sense or do not make sense if you didn't understand anything i tried to explain ask there that's your place and then have fun at the tables
