### TOPIC: cash river strategies
 The one I chose for today is the river after check back. So actually, this is a couple of spots, as you might figure out at the same time, because it's a river from all perspectives. We will talk about being the aggressor. So as always, I'll take button versus big blind as the example with the widest ranges. This is lots of stuff we can transfer to other spots. And actually, it gets easier from there to find some golden rules so we have a couple of spots and yeah this is our plan for today i'll quickly run down the spot we're talking about as always then i'll just name the decision points we are having that we are discussing today i'll put up into two areas two areas. One is versus action, which means villainous betting, and we have a decision to make. And the other one is versus check. So the plan is to leave the session today with kind of a plan to not play that perfectly. It's impossible. It's a really, really, really tough spot. Lots of lots of mixes lots of sizes lots of reaction versus different sizes lots of it depends answers because we are further down in the game tree this is where we come a little to the exploitative thoughts obviously as well people play differently before so the solver output is not the holy grail that we have, but it can tell us what we should keep an eye on. So if GTO Wizard will run later, it wasn't doing well right now. I'll give you some examples. If not, I'll make some up. It's also fine then have some key take. No worries, we'll have some paint games as well where I will explain a little stuff in my way especially when it comes to like on what we should focus what to think about in spots because if we look up stuff lots of lots of things seem kind of random right every catcher seems about zero ev which hands we are raising seems about absolutely random which hands we are bluffing seems about absolutely random We'll talk about blockers, unblockers, stuff like that. And then a little about the maybe I'll, I'll run that down depending on time, like a little guideline on what is how important. When we are actually playing a game versus real opponents and off the solver. So we'll make a small distinction there between real game, solver game, what we can transfer and whatnot. All right. We're a small group today. Even better for everyone who is here. Take your time. Ask questions. There are no stupid questions. I'm super happy to answer anything that's coming up. Obviously, regarding that spot, feel free to ask private stuff as well. I don't care. So it's cool. And yeah, anything that you might be interested in and we'll have a great session. All right, let's get things going. The spot, you see not much text. Very, very easy. I think I explained to you what happens is that hero, I or we or whatever I want to use here is that we open race. For the examples, I will use the button, but it works the same from the cutoff, hijack, load jack, under the gun, full ring, whatever. and we do race for the examples i will use the button but it works the same from the cutoff high jack low jack under the gun full ring whatever and we do c-bet the flop i will work with small c-bets because this is the majority of the spots that we will be in obviously the spot works as well with different future game tree if we bet big right that spot will come up also maybe a little less often because we gain more fold equity we play a different range and so on and what obviously needs to happen is that villain ends up calling turn we see a turn card it goes check check and then we are already in that spot a river card will be dealt and there will be action or no action that's up to villain and up to us and these are the decision points we will be talking about. Are blockers relevant in single race pots thought more so on three bad pots? Yes they are but not as much. So the influence of blockers in wide ranges very very good question are there but they are not huge right so if we talk about a range that contains let's say 20 combos like a three bad pot call down on the river something like that and we are blocking like three of them or maybe even five flushes or something like that this can have a massive massive massive influence on fold equity or villains value to bluff ratio. When we talk like ranges that contain 50 50 combos or even hundreds of combos while using our two cards to have blocking effects and maybe while doing something like like influencing 10 combos or five combos or something like that just relatively is a smaller influence but it is still there i use it mainly for navigation right something like we are not bluffing the busted flush draw because we want villain to have the flush draw that he folds that is something easy right this is kind of yeah it has an influence it's very very obvious but it won't be that that that that that big and not talking about this very specific game tree let's say we talk about betting on the river after a villain checks to us what are the best bluffs i would say we we think about whatever ace high king high board we end up in that line with a 10-9 high what should we do should we randomize do our suits play a certain role or not at all? Or whatever. It will be like tiny, tiny influences that we see maybe with some frequency in GTO Wizard or it's all a mix and we say like, okay, let's run a randomizer. We don't care. Let's have exploitative reasons for whatever we want to do. Or maybe there's something small that we can hold to, right? That there's like, okay, I know this is maybe the best suit. This is the worst suit. And often we can simplify things from the solver. And often in spots, I have a very clear suit ranking that I say like clubs in a certain spot for blocker reasons are the best one to bluff. And hearts are the worst, that there'll be a hard flush draw and whatever kind of backdoor flush draw on the flop we'll talk about that so yes blockers are relevant but not influencing ev and now we can fly fly through the spot as you say so decision points we're talking about so first of all again this was a great great great question loving that keep more coming and now we talk about the decision points what can happen after the turn check check is first of all which happens quite a lot villain is betting a certain amount so actually this is a couple of parts of the game tree he can bet small he can bet medium he can bet over bet he can bet three times pot whatever right and against all those sizes we have two decisions mainly. It's a call or fold decision, or it's a raise decision. Some hands are maybe call or raise, some hands are fold or raise, some hands are call or fold. All of those are different decisions. So what I want to leave you with is to have an idea which hands we're looking for. what what the big point for our call fault decision and what is well the decision for which are the hands we are raising. So yeah if like my goal would be that if you leave this session we have and I give you a certain board that you can tell me well a threshold what is important for the calling hands and something like well what is the threshold for the value hands we are raising and then also what are the best candidates to put in as a bluff race important to me is that we never forget any of those right it's very very easy villain block bets and we instead of having 20 percent raising range that maybe we should have in lots of spots versus block bets, we end up with 10%. Because the more pressure we can put on villain, the more money we will make if we do it in a way that makes sense. It's just we have the chance to win the pot uncontested. This is what we want to do. All right, the second big decision point is villain checks to us. And I split it up again into a couple of things right first of all what is the threshold for us value betting that depends also on the sizing we are using right what does the run out tell us how is the range distribution which sizing should we use should we split our range should we use one sizing things working? And then again, which are the first bluffs? I always have in my head a list of bluff candidates that I say, this is my first bluff. Even against the biggest calling station, I'm bluffing this one. And then maybe there is a list in my head going down. It's like, yeah, this is a little worse a little worse bluff and this is a really ridiculously bad bluff but maybe there are some spots where against the correct opponent I still want to bluff just everything and then this makes it into it. Just to give myself a chance and then decide like how far do I want to go with bluffing. Okay so this is what we are going to talk about. It's a lots of things so we won't dig too deep but I want to give you those couple of golden rules I have in my mind I came up with one when preparing that session and playing a little GTO wizard and seeing and trying to figure things out myself. Alright before actually coming to the example I think this fits best now is To put everything into perspective because We talked about that here, right? So let's say 0 we talked about a 10 big blind pot Whatever whether that fits 3 bad pot or not tight range wide range. We don't care right? So this is a 10 big blind pot and whatever right whether it's a certain pot size and villain puts out a certain bet size i want to keep things general so there let's say it's a range of our decisions that can go from like plus 10 bb to minus 10 bb then i want to put that out there that we know what we are talking about that if we have bluff catcher facing a bet that will be our first spot we face a bet and we have a bluff catcher that well there are some people that are never bluffing right so actually this year is the real mistake we can be doing right if we catch against someone who is never ever bluffing we're losing the maximum amount right so it would be here this is what we are losing oops and there are some people that are crazy over bluffing there's no chance that we always win because people have always some value maybe there are some special people who all bluff like a certain size and they only have bluffs that would be exception the exception but like for the general thing. I don't want to put the Max positive outcome not to the maximum right but like here So actually we're talking about decisions where we are will end up in this range On the left side people never never never bluffing on the right side people being super bluff heavy So that being said like against someone super bluff heavy Well, every catcher will be plus cv some will be even more plus cv than others But all of them will be plus cv. This is a range we're talking about And now everything we see from the solver Because the solver is like playing like perfect ratios is just the EV is just dependent on our influence on their value to bluff ratio so our two cards will make them slightly value heavy slightly bluff heavy just because we know he doesn't have this king he doesn't have this nine he doesn't have this or that so we are talking about this small area that we see in the solver so why am i saying that i don't want you to search for reasons after that session to call because stefan said so this is the perfect hand you need to call this because he bets small and so on no if someone is not bluffing enough we don't need that i just want you to have a ranking and understand this is the best one so on the exploitative side we can make let's say a decision between minus 10 BB and plus 5 big blinds and all the blockers or what we will be talking about today maybe is from the minus 1 or minus 0.5 to the plus 0.5 range. This is the influence we are having and it's way way way way way smaller than everything else The trap of prioritizing a minimum defense frequency over pot odds, range construction, card removal effects Well for me like this is a part of it, but the biggest part is the player type To really forget that because looking for a reason so always in those spots We need to stay open-minded and not only see one side right it's very easy to find if like let me let me turn things around i think what i'm very very good at and this is why i love coaching as well in a way is that i can justify any bullshit play right if i'm searching for a reason to call because i'm a little tilted i will find one and i'm like very good at presenting that to you as if it was a genius play but if i'm searching for a reason to fold i will find also a reason right and i will be it will be possible for me to present it to you in the same way that it looks like a genius super clear fold so what is important is to really look at both sides and this is kind of if I am in my a game I can take my time and I can weigh up those things right that I'm like okay like this is pro this is minus in my head there is something running like like this let's say let's start here. And I have incentives in this exactly like in this direction, in this direction, and another influence in this direction and this in that direction. And that all combined is like, it's again like zero. Or it's like that. And then like, okay, it's clear, clearly call. But it's easy if we act quickly Oh, we block something and only think about this year and this is why we fold Stuff like that So I want you to stay open-minded to not take the first reason for everything And then make a decision and you find it and present it to your friends and poker buddies. No, this is not how it works It's like really if this guy is not bluffing he's not bluffing and this is the this is overruling everything all right so kind of we have priorities when making decisions let's say i want to write that down when making decisions we have priorities spell my example is bluff catching or like folding like if i think about betting is folding which hands is he folding and so on is villain and let's write down what is the second one any idea what is the second most important thing anyone wants to risk it in the chat okay i'll help you out just ask yourself the same thing again right and then the third thing no surprise just ask yourself the same thing again and now you can start thinking about like if there's like three times you got a yes or there is a chance then you can start thinking about stuff right in those tough spots actually where it's tough to be over bluffing it works the other way i don't want to say everyone is a nit but it works the other way around is someone under bluffing and so on but yeah what would the solver do is like really and this is all we look at all the examples will be solver examples obviously um this is what we are looking at so i don't want to make you big calling stations or crazy bluffers if it's not correct um so this is so far down we go but I can't help you in this session with one two three we talked about stats we talked about HUD the last time we talked about player types and lots of the videos so this is something that you will find there online especially looking at the recreationals. Okay so enough of that finally I can start with the presentation. Often Overlook is not asking the question, is villain value betting thin enough? If they don't, then their value to bluff ratio also tilts towards bluff. Yes, yes, exactly, right? Another thing, right? Both sides, I always make the people are not bluffing joke, but it works the other way around as well, right? So very, very often a flush gets there and so on and they keep betting, oh, it's so tough to find bluffs, but often you just ask yourself Well, what are they still value betting right everything they were representing before maybe They are not value betting anymore. And then there's like oh the all the bluffs left. So this exists also so very good point Alright, so we have two main decision two game trees We talked about villain bets or villain checks to us and I'll'll start with an easy example because there was lots of talking now. And yeah, this is from GTO Wizard. Very, very, very easy. It's button versus pick blind. I just run down the hand for you. We c-bet the flop on a7, 4 rainbow. Turn is a 6. So we c-bet, villain calls. Turn is a rainbow, 6 6, it goes check check. River is a queen. I think every one of you has played this spot or a spot similar like that and villain block bets. Villain block bets 2.5 into 9 in this sim and we see a 20% raising range. We see lots of calls and so on. And I had a question in mind that I absolutely forgot that I wanted to ask you, but yeah, maybe some words. Let's ask some words. So it's like, what is the most important thing here when you think about the call or fold decision? We see some things like, you're ever a queen. Solver says the call or fold is like, the call or fold decision. We see some things like you river a queen. Solver says the call or fold is like the call is plus 0.3 big blinds out of a what is it then a 14 big blind pot or you have the freaking jack four from the flop that you checked back. Again you win nine percent of a big blind so nine percent of a big blind out of a 14 big blind pot. The king four is indifferent. Okay, cool. Every six is calling, every seven is calling, and this is kind of not minimum defense frequency, but like very call happy. So what is your thought process personally in game there about your call fold decisions? We've all had it, right? Like I sit there with queen 10, I just c-bet the flop, river that queen, villain bets on it like, ah, he only has better. And queen 10 is already a very good hand. Or we have the freaking 6, 10-6 suited. I play it exactly that way. I c-bet it on the flop always, I check it back on the turn always, I face that riverbed always. And then I sit there like, ah, yeah... No bluffs fold all the time, clear big, big, big overfold as we can see here. If I just fold all those catchers, I have a four. What is your thought process there? What are, is your like category one, two things you think about? They're kind of like, I don't want to hear now whether the villain's over bluffing. I'm more like, more things that really make sense in the end, what are you thinking about? How much air has Big Blind left to bluff? How many ace-axes has Apollo Range? So now we have two beautiful things at the same time. So Chevy is thinking about the bluffs. Luke is thinking about the value bets, all so very very good thing i would rephrase actually chevy's sentence here and say like which hand can which hands can villain bluff right east ear left to bluff is a little weird because bluffs can change over time and so on if people are playing correctly but like which bluffs can i expect now this is something right where here i think it's not that easy already like the six bringing all straight draws here so the bluffs should be something we can already have an idea if we look at the difference between jack six and king six or king four and jack four then lots of king highs should bluff so hands i don't want to have are the king x with the backdoor flush draw for example like villains should check call something like king five of diamonds king five of hearts and king five of spades on the flop and those are clear bluffs now might obviously something like deuce five and three five if they are not check raising that heavily well another thing right they might check right? They might check-raise those, they might call those. Another thing, they are very very clear bluffs. Something like just a king-jack, king-10 maybe is something that Willem could bluff now. Something like a backdoor like an 8-9, 10-8 suited is maybe something they should float. So this is something very very very important here to think about and now first golden rule if I think about bluff catching I Always try to create the image in my mind which hand I'm looking for. It's like Yeah, it just helps a lot. And then if you have that image in your head is like yeah, you look at that opponent again It's like is this guy like really calling ten eight suited on the flop if the answer is a clear no because it's a freaking It well, then I'm not looking for any bluff catches If this guy is super crazy, well, then yeah, I just click the call button So another thing it's too obvious because I stated already the first thing we want to look at is actually the sizing Not just just like how often do we need to win. I said villainous betting 2.5 into 9. Can someone quickly tell me how often I need to win? I do the math myself here. 1 sixth is that actually correct? Like close-ish close enough close enough so it's I think it's the 2.5 divided by the 14 like the 9 in the pot plus 2.5 plus 2.5 it's close to 1 6 but something like that right so 17 point which means let's do it like that right one out of 5.61 times so this really means we should lose a lot right so this is already what you go into with making that decision we are supposed to lose a lot lot lot lot lot we need to find that one special snowflake bluff and if we do well then it was a massive winning call right let's let's imagine how much we are winning if we just call and win one out of four times that would be insane so really this is our expectation if villain overbets totally different story but i could show that to you as well but now the jail wizard is somehow off here with my internet but obviously everything changes so this is now the price is the first thing and then for you in game think about which hands you're trying to find We are trying to find villains king five king deuce of hearts here Okay, next thing. What are you looking for if you think about making a bluff race? We see we have like 18% raises here or 20 if we combine it with that like 82% standard sizing We have our aces traps maybe something i doubt that you guys check back ace king ace queen on the turn but still if you do you have it you obviously have the river two pairs we have like some two pair traps and ace four probably no one again checks it on the turn but it makes sense and now the question is where do your bluffs come from hence that had showdown value, but now lost it against the river betting range. So something like four or5, you're saying, right? And why do you prefer that over something like the random 8-9? Do you have like a ranking for yourself? Just, I don't know. Just like, it does not matter that much. You see like all those hands are okay to raise sometimes but for me important is that you don't forget raises and it's easy to forget those 3% raises or to make them super super super randomly that you have like kind of golden rule for yourself and understand it why those are the best hands. Okay ideally block block villain lead calls versus button raise, right? So we want him to have a bet now because that's what he does, but then we want him to fold also, right? So it's good to block something like a two pair or a strong hand. What is also important is not his lead calls, but his lead continuation. So it's very good to not only block the lead calls but also block the lead re-raises. So there I want to quickly show something that we see perfectly in that example. Let's start let's just talk about villains range. Alright so villain has a very wide range on the flop right he has two pairs he has sets and so on. He calls our small bet What happens to his range? He check raises most of his strong stuff, right? We have done that a couple of times. So I take away his top part and He obviously folds his weakest shit Alright, so he has a condensed range now the six comes and He improves some of his hands improve. I'll just make some more things here some of that improve Let's say he makes a couple of straights on that six. They are super nuts now. He makes a couple of two pairs Something like that, right? Check check Also, he still has those Next thing is. Again, improves stuff. So some new two pairs for the queen. This time no straight. Better than the 6x2 pair, something like that. This is its range. So what we want to do is block his best hands. His freaking best hands. Because those are the ones he builds on the river. He's still uncapped after it goes check check on that six he can check to check raise he can bet small to bet re-raise those are the hands that give us the most pressure if we make sure he has less of those that's very very good right so now figuring out that it was the turn of the river card that made me move those freaking lines there. Sure the flop traps if he check calls ace four only but that's not the majority. So the majority of two pairs he's having they contain a six or a queen or it's maybe the straights so it's like that combination of hands that contain a six and or a straight card is the ones that we see the most here. Right six eight eight six five okay a seven can't hurt the five but it's a little less interesting six nine and then the queen is just too good as a call this is why we won't use the queen for race but the queen would make sense if villain bets big it's the first thing we do is the using the queen because then our queen bluff catcher gets worse and we use it for raising. So this just is a very very easy logical explanation why we want to use certain hands for raising more than others. The other point which is the explanation for threes and deuces here is we just want to unblock bluffs. Right here villains bluffs are out of that region that we are never thinking about like tens are never calling so villains bluffs should contain some 10x king x is not calling so they should contain a king so the deuce threes are like jokers unblocking everything okay i hope that makes somewhat sense i could talk like you see it's lots of spots at the same time i try to drop some gold rules you can stop it you can test it you can see other examples how that works that's my personal gold rule having that turn card is better than having a flop card having a river card when it's not already a very good calling catcher that's the next one you want to take because this is the majority of hands villain has obviously if straights get there that's gets more important it's about the best hands it's just just if there are not many straights, right? 5-3 is a very high frequency check raise. 5-8 also, so it's not that interesting. Here it's more about two pairs. This is why having a six or having a queen is great. In other spots it's just about having a flush card, having this, having that. Okay, so calling decision we think about the sizing most and then make our decision. have in our head the image of the hands we're looking for we want villain to block those and we when raising we think about blocking the best part of villain because this is where he builds not only his bad re-raises around his bad re-raise bluffs value but also his bad re-raise bluffs right if villain takes some 5 re-raise bluffs, right? If villain takes some 5x for bluffing, that's probably the one he takes for the bet re-raise then as well, right? Just play it like a straight lookalikes. So having that blocks both part of villain's continuations. Okay, cool. Let's leave it as it is here and now get to something else before adding a little something on paint. And I think like we might need two hours, but I'll just like extend that for another add-on then. But example one, the other spot. This one. So it's the same board, but now Vilon checked to us instead of betting small small all right so we see that we have like one main sizing again we c bet the flop turn those check check river villain checks to us again we have obviously all the ace x we check back ace five is like the value threshold ace eight is the clear bet this is something to find but very often it's very clear on the value side we have our river two pairs we can put a little something into an overbet some ace queen ace jack queen four queen six it's exactly those hands that are strong but start getting a bluff catcher versus a check race you can keep it simple just, I would use one size 75% and put all of them in there and be super protected. But the weaker villain is the more you can split things up and just take what you want. Okay, now we have a big question. What do we do with our bluffs? All right, we sit there with our jack-10 We see that jack-10 high frequency. We give it up all the time on the turn Do we take it on the river? We have 10-9. Do we take this one? Apparently always 10-8 always 8-9. Well, we mainly bet those on the turn. So those are lower frequency already What do we do with like king-3, king-deuce? It's's apparently bluff. K8, okay we bet the turn. What about, what else do we have? That's it. K8 offsuit not bluffing. Yeah, how do we make the decision? J10, J9, 10, 9, anything coming to mind? Alright, so this is the first thing that I usually go with. it sucks a little on ace high boards right because the backdoor flush draws from the flop are usually the ones that check down uh here i think if villain has like a king five of spades it's just a very clear bluff and this is why we see that mix that we don't see clearly something that is that is going more for it um i i looked at the suits, let me try to open GTO Wizard now again to show that. But if it's not an Ace High board, villain has all the Ace High backdoor flush draws, and those are the ones we want to unblock because those are the check call flop, try to check down and then snap check fold river. Okay, so let me see. Looks a little better, still slow, but. So, but now we can again make that a little more simple than just saying backdoor flush draws. This is something to keep an eye on, but we can also just say the hands that Willem plays that way that are snap, folds, on the river. It's not that easy to come up with those. So now I ask you exploitatively who is our best victim for a bet check bet bluff? Who do we love bluffing a lot and we go like instead of only taking king deuce king three we take our king seven king eight also and bluff it? Any idea who is the best person to just attack? And it's still laggy as shit. That guy that won't check-raise us and overfolds, that's a kind of a simple answer. It's obviously right, but we are looking for the reasons why they overfold, what happens, but we'll get to... Actually, let's... We can do that also now. Actually, I prepared something for the exploitative part then and maybe let's let's keep that let's keep that for later but it's it's the first victim is the person that forgot gets to to to bluff his bluffs right if he does not bluff himself he has that shit in his checking range and all his river bluffs are snap folds obviously If villain is not bluffing his king five of hearts himself, well, he will fold this hand. Obviously it also helps if villains are never check-raise bluffing, because then they end up calling, that doesn't help us, but maybe they end up folding with a hand like, I don't know, four five, six five, seven five, whatever the check-raise bluffs on the river are. Maybe the river are maybe a queen who knows right so I'll see I try and find that here this is the sim might be there in 10 minutes what is dangerous here if we say passive in general because there are lots of players who are just not value betting thinly enough if they are not value betting their ace deuce here and they just check call it well that gets quite costly. We just put money in their strong range a lot. So here it's different sizes somehow. At 4.5 didn't exist here. It's a slightly different sim. Sorry, I didn't want it here. Let's have a look at the 10-9s. Something we can see here slightly is maybe... Oh, is actually good. The Jack-9 of clubs how it's 100% preferred over everything else. This is where we see the backdoor flush draw thing. Now it will be different for all the different Sims. This is just slightly different break, slightly different. You see the King-deuce, King-3 looks slightly different. This will change all the time so it does not make sense to remember any type of hands but some certain golden rules. We see like here that the Jack-9 of clubs is preferred over the other suits. This is something that is just a very common thing here. We see it here also apparently the 8 is not that important like the 9 but stuff like that. Okay let's continue here and get to something else very general very very important and again i'm loving it i hope you you you it's not too much if not let me know and i'll go a little slower or keep it for for an add-on i ask the next question when we think about both calling let's say we face a bet and we think about calling or we think about betting ourselves and think about villains calling and for continuing in folding range. We start thinking about blockers. So let's take the example that villain bets. Villain bets, we think about calling. What is more important is my question. Blocking value or unblocking bluffs? Very easy question. One, please everyone in the chat, make your decision. What is more important? Number one in the chat for blocking value or number two for unblocking bluffs? Luke goes with the unblocking bluffs. Thank you. Number one in the chat for blocking value or number two for unblocking bluffs Luke goes with the unblocking bluffs Unblocking bluffs deep into mortar says depends on the value to bluff ratio. So depends on the size. That's incorrect It does not depend on the size. I mean kind of but no So, unblocking value sucks. Then villain has lots of value hands. So, unblocking value sucks then villain has lots of value hands. So unblocking value is definitely true and not one of the options Guys, come on a little one or two in the chat Blocking value is more important for Damien. Okay one blocking value blocking value blocking value blocking value, blocking value. All right, so we have a rather clear vote here, maybe, with the last answers, which means we have a clear winner as well, which is the, well, which is Luke. Unblocking bluffs is more important always. Okay, when we call bet. So let me do that example quickly. Where is GTO Wizard? Here. Let's take this example here. This exact example, I want to have the same SIM like here. Let's take the the 1k rig. Where is it? 1k rig, 100 BB, here we go. We have that board and now the sizing should be the same like in the sim I have in the in the presentation Okay, so now we got here in that way and we see that let's use the block bet as the first example But I will talk about bet sizes in general So here, Willem bets 2.5 into 9.1 and we have a range of 50 combos So 50 combos, let's just write that down to not forget. 50 combo range, B2.5 into, let's make it 9, a little easier. Okay, how much, like, what's Willens value to bluff ratio? How, what's the percentage of bluffs he's allowed to have? It's a very easy math here right so he's risking 2.5 divide that through bet size plus pot size so through 11.5 so 21.73% are allowed to be bluffs alright so 21.73% 93% bluffs which means Not mess it up 78.2 something percent value, given that's bet size. So obviously pot late is bluff percentage. Okay, wait, I don't know. I'm never using pot odds, but this is the math, so it should be fine. So if we use that for the exact combos, which luckily, let's make it exactly 50, and then we present it in that way is that we have 10.8 bluffs and we have what is 39 value right so we have or we can leave it with the percentages that's also fine right whether it's it's 50 combos or we work like with 100, doesn't matter. So now the question is how can we influence that more, the ratio? It's obviously we need to do something about the small thing, right? So if we have one combination less of bluffs because we block it, it has way, way, way, way more influence than blocking or unblocking one of the value combos. Does that make sense? We cut off like one combo here, it's relatively not a big piece, but if we cut off one combo here it has like quite a good. Let's take the example and we cut off ten combos, right? So let's make massive, we have a massive blockerer We find the massive super blocker and can either unblock 10 bluffs or block 10 value, right, so Obviously unblocking 10 bluffs now sucks because then we have 30 combos or something like that The math doesn't really check out like that. We would need another number to start but yeah, it works out I hope it still makes sense that way right so we can either block that and then we have 28.7 versus 68.2 well let's make it different right let's make it different sorry for that that's a little weird now let's make it something that works. A neutral hand blocks both in the right ratio. So this is four times more. Let's say we block one bluff and four value. This three times let's say we have a ratio of like 18 bluffs versus 66 value. That's kind of we kept the ratio the same. And now I'm allowed to'm allowed to block and unblock something at the same time, right? If I have the full combi combos, I can't unblock anything. So now I unblocked one bluff or block one value, right? So let's let's make it easy. Do we want to have 19 versus 66 or do we want to have 18 versus 65, right? So and there the answer answer is very very clear if I take bigger numbers like our super blocker Then it gets more and more like that Okay, so percentage wise bigger impact this makes sense because well against the small bet size we only only need to win once in a lifetime and Just allowing villain to have this once-in-a-lifetime hand makes it good for us whether he is like 10 value combos or 11 or 12 actually doesn't make Difference here. So now coming back to deep into mortar who said it depends on the size But what happens sorry one question here, but what happens when there's no clear preferred bluffs But there are many combos you can choose from to bluff then it gets tougher to block obviously that's true this is why even with the weakest hands villains should mainly mix sizings very often but yeah if i ask the question the way that we can block or unblock that's more important and on average it is right so um yeah maybe it's tough to use blockers but often with with busted straight draws and maybe passive opponents. It's very clear which hands they are having for us that is easier, right if it's Bet-check bet from our side. We have everything to choose from that villain has a bluff here on the river He needs to check call a flop bet first, which he can't do with any hand. So his range is more defined than ours. We have more to choose from, and this is why even we mix a little more, right? It's like that jack-10, jack-9 whatsoever. Okay, right? It's like suits. We could say clubs is best, but it's just taking it slightly more. Because if we always take clubs, it's very easy for villain to react react he knows if he doesn't have clubs he unblocks our bluffs he calls all the time and if he has clubs he blocks the bluffs he folds this is how the solver works but maybe for in-game that's a good idea to do exactly that against depending on how good the players are to just understand the game a little more here we still see how the clubs Two clubs are just pretty nice. All right, now I want to give this short explanation why it is a little sizing dependent but not really to answer that question what DeepIntoMotor said because whatever the sizing is you need more value than bluffs. Even if you bet like 10 times pot, if you bet 10 times pot then you are allowed to bluff 47.6% of the time. It's still the smaller circle, the bluffs are still the smaller circle. It's not possible to bluff more than 50%, it just doesn't work out. Even if you want to bet infinite and this is the reason why always unblocking is more unblocking bluffs is more important. Okay so really big big big learning here that it was at some point for myself and it should be for you as well knowing which hands villain is bluffing or what you are looking for is very very very important and then finding that let's I make another easy example okay we open race under the gun to have a little tighter ranges more blockery effects and we have an ace queen six board we see that whatever size let's go half pot this time villain continues we call turn is another ace goes check check and the river is a freaking nine could add flushes and everything here right so now villain block bets or bets normal or whatever size let him bet normal we can see very very well it's played differently oh sorry uh villain bets normal and then i was missing all the hands i was looking for and now we have a decision under the gun we see something like pocket jacks tens and kings just like snap folding. Pocket 8s call all the time, pocket 5s are cool and pocket 4s end up raising. I just, what is Willem bluffing? Jack 10 as the first hand, 100%. Some King 10, some King Jack, right? It's like, this is what we are looking for. So it's very, very easy going for that, right know he's he's like he's having those hands for sure he needs to bluff them in a way so i'm looking for those bluffs and then i can make like some crazy calls or crazy raises and so on let's have a look he isn't even allowed to bluff all the jack tens like let's say 20 30 of those he needs to give up. If someone is betting them all the time, I'm printing money if I call my pocket fives here. All right. So easy, easy explanation with that unblocking. Okay, cool. We're not even halfway through the presentation, I think, but it doesn't matter. It's more summaries now. Like I thought this this was the main part, just talking about an example here. So versus action. What I want you to already take away is a little. What if we never check back strong A-x do we still choose K-10 as a bluff? In that ace-queen-ace example. Well this is very very specific. Well we are deviating with one part of our range for a reason usually which means now you think about deviating from the logic again to make your range fit right on the one hand you're playing exploitatively because you deviate something but then you try to back deviate to be somewhat sound again to change it's like it's i hope you know what i mean it's a it's a weird question i'm like using my hands a lot to explain even though i i know you you can't see me right now but yeah if you deviate and you're you're not checking back your strong aces ever well this this has to be for a reason and that does not shouldn't influence your your river bluffs that are for another reason maybe right now maybe you could say okay you're betting the turn more often because he calls too often. Now I could say that your range goes hand in hand with that. You need to bet more often with your bluffs on the turn, but well, you were betting because he calls too often, or I don't know what the reason is to deviate there in the first place. I want you to understand where it's coming from. And then the deviations are an absolute different topic and it's all case by case, I would say. Okay, let's talk about that quickly here, summarize that versus action villainous betting. What is the first things we need to think about? Villains sizing is the most important. Before even thinking about the player type. Okay, he's betting small. He has a cheap price. I need to call a lot. Very easy. If we play versus the solver and we face a small bet and we have a piece of the flop we're just not folding like i was always playing gto was it there and i was looking for the folds and it's just like no there's there's no folds you have a piece he bets small once in a lifetime you find a bluff there we go all right so just knowing now that the solver comes up with a perfect bluff value ratio just taking that as a given thing means that only our two cards influence his range whether it's value or bluff heavy he has the perfect range not thinking about the the blockers so now we know we have this King and we have this 10 and it's either a positive or a negative or a neutral effect and this is everything we need to do against the solver which means if we do that against humans it works also but we can do better than that thinking about players what are they bluffing what should they be bluffing which hands are they maybe playing differently before right so here i plant the paint games on blocking unblocking we did them already so that's even better very thin line yeah it's hard now I got it. Yeah, it's a very thin line that we're talking about there. Absolutely. Okay Versus action raise. I hope you remember that Villain sizing still is most important. It tells us Okay, we need to defend a lot which means we need to raise a lot. have lots of value raises. We need to find our value threshold which usually is easy with some some training It's very easy and then knowing your potential bluffs. I didn't want to write it down there It's the turned and rivered strong hands is what we want to block. Villain Gets rid of lots of lots of strong flop hands by check raising. This is why we don't care about them. Often the turn peer is very interesting or the rivered peer is very interesting or if straights get there by the river maybe blocking those is very interesting because that does not only block the actual strong hands villain has but also blocks the hands he would go for bluffs with if that exists exactly yeah now i got it after thinking about it three seconds deep into mortar that's it right just a very very thin it's very very marginal ev gains there if playing a villain actually plays perfectly but still i have that in my head ranking of better bluff catchers and worse bluff catchers because if we always No matter how much villains bluffing or not if we always catch the better bluff catchers and do not catch the worst bluff catchers This will add up right if we catch the best even against the biggest Knit well, it's losing but it's probably less losing than catching with the worst ones right in the same way against the biggest biggest crazy guys that turn everything into bluff catching the best ones makes even more money than catching the worst ones okay so just if we don't know we have that ranking in our head and i still want to take the top ones and don't have a big mix that I like just imagine at one point you fold the best catcher maybe it was right against that player but then another time you call with the worst one like yeah sometimes we just don't know and therefore we want to have that ranking very very helpful for that ranking is just the the absolute numbers in GTO wizard right you know is it is it is it like in theory a plus 0.5 catcher? Is it a plus? 0-0 catcher. Let's say this year villain bats are pocket eights. They make 0.06 Every queen like a queen nine makes 0.4 big blinds zero point depends on the suit But a queen ten because the ten is so shitty is actually indifferent right just like but they have it but they have it and we end up folding ace deuce it would be an absolute disaster all right so know your potential bluffs I gave you a small hint here but this is a big mix that you I want to create that feeling anything like oh I blocked this river at something this is why I could go for it. Obviously if people are not bluffing enough and you are attacking this range it won't work out but if villain again is over bluffing and you attack that range it will work out perfectly. Again it's that spot we don't know how they play but if we take the better bluffs for bluffing and don't go for the worst ones that works out better Okay, next one we talked about the versus check Versus check we have again a line for value betting first job that we have is open our Compartments or draws principle think about which sizings do exist which sizes do I want to go for for therefore i think about the possibility of villain check raising the more villainous check raising the less i hate i like to split my range so if the river card is absolutely me well i can i can use all sizings in this world right from like take the river set put it in there take i don't know a weak top pair bet 1 third in position whatever like the weaker the opponented set, put it in there, take, I don't know, a weak top pair, bet one third in position, whatever. Like the weaker the opponent, the more crazy stuff I can do. The more I'm scared for people sniffing things out, the more I keep my range together. So the golden rule I have is just that I keep my range together and villain is uncapped. Just bet 75. That's fine. Understanding that those hands that are strong value but still hate to get check raised like two pair on a flush draw board something like this are the first ones to actually like slightly over bet or bet bigger to get the value think about the the race course where do we want to end up with like 75 maybe it's not good for that hand good enough and one other golden rule if you don't want like just no don't be crazy, right? Don't bet less than 50% on the river. It's not worth it if check raising can be a thing So just something very very easy for the value betting and now coming to the bluffs First thing go with showdown value villains are making mistake mistakes Especially recreationals. Against them, if you end up checking down jack high sometimes, you will end up winning every now and then. I've played against so many recreationals that do not bluff their five high missed gutshot or something. So this is something I would recommend doing even more than the solver to just go with showdown value forget about blockers if you sit there with six high this is your bluff even if it's slightly bad just because people do not play perfectly and there is a chance that he's just full of shit and he folds right so if you have something that has marginal potential showdown value not in the solver but if villain makes one mistake then you end up winning well that's maybe the bluff you can leave away right and then know what you want to fold out this is again unblocking the other part of unblocking if you're betting now this is something we're actually blocking something gets can get important as well regarding the sizing right so when villain is betting he always needs more value than he needs bluff more than 50 value ratio but when we talk about villains call folding range we can create a scenario where we need villain to fall 25 but we can also create a scenario where villain needs to fold 75 5% right we bet less than pot, it's more important to think about which hands is villain folding. For example, if we are block betting 10%, we just need villain to fold something and we are profitable. If we think about jamming five times pot, we better think about villain snap calls and block block that value part. Because then this is the smaller part. We are expecting him to fold like 70% snap. Exactly. So the bigger the sizing, the more our hand matters that we choose to bluff. And unblocking snap folds with a standard range. I'm still saying standard in those situations after bet check bet is betting less than the pot. Still unblocking snap folds is more important where it comes to our little rule of unblocking backdoor flush draws. Okay so this showdown value is like a non-solver thing here. Solver obviously takes it into account also but because of all the mistakes people are doing this is even more important to me. Okay so much nuance to blocking. Yeah in the end in the solver we see it doesn't matter because the solver is always like reacting perfectly to each other. Solver one versus solver two so they need to outsmart each other but we still see even versus the smartest solver in the world some suits are a little better for certain reasons. Okay. Exploitative thoughts. It will take another 10 minutes, but I think that's fine. I split things up. Exploitative thoughts. What does exploiting mean? So again, we get back to rock, paper, scissors, right? So first, we want to know what is right. I tried to explain that in easy, today, but as easy as possible. Secondly, we want to understand what villain is doing wrong. We want to find that out. This is where exploiting starts. Then we want to know the right exploits. So exploiting means that villain already did something wrong. And here I want to split that up into villain did something wrong in the past and villain will do something wrong in the future. So in our spot, let's say our example our example is a call fold raise decision, right? Raise decision on the river after checking back turn. What is something that villain, what is something that villain potentially did wrong in the past? Any ideas that influences our call fold raise decision? Alright, so not check raising flop enough with certain hands. Let's make a clear example here not check raising straight draws enough, right? So makes him way stronger on straight cards leaves him with lots of air on Like non straight cards And so very very easy right if someone is not check raising 5 6 on a 7 4 and not 8 6 and not Whatever right then he sits there on those five highs eight highs and so on or if the turn card gets there well he has it very very often not floating enough right or so let's this is one option i'll just call that easier over folding flop so might be potential lack of river bluffs this is very easy perfect examples i don't think we need way more than that it's just he's lacking stuff that he needs in certain situations on the river. Given the certain run outs this guy will be under bluffing or over bluffing very very clearly. Okay what is something that villain potentially will do wrong in the future? Alright so I so I said he bets here, so let's stick to one example, but overfall versus river race, that's kind of the same thing. If he blocks and we race or he checks and we bet, so I keep it to that example. Overfall versus river race, I want to split that up actually to just show what is important. Not calling enough versus river race and maybe another thing not re-bluffing versus river race right because this is a more common thing maybe that people have their five to seven percent value and they should add like another two three percent bluffs but they are never doing it right so and this is now this is what we are mainly talking about like Like should we bluff this guy is he catching very often? It is not because he calls his catchers. Let's actually switch the example and say like okay. He checks to us That's now let's go to the button example again. Sorry Please be fast, please be fast. So let's go not sure sure about the suits. A7,4 maybe like that. Check, we bet small. Call, turn was the six of clubs. Check. Check. And the river is the queen of diamonds. So. Check. Alright, so there are a couple of options, right? If we think about bluffing, we usually think, ah I has this guy folding. Oh, he has a seven He has whatever is he folding? That's what we think about about the future. We always think about the future We think about the future Where is it? right He should fall 40% but in this spot like on average people are falling more like 60 70 percent and every freaking bluff is just possible And it's not because they are not calling their queen or whatever they might have or sometimes end up calling a seven or not no it's mainly because they they had made mistakes in the past right that they did not find the bluffs here right that maybe they did not bluff their king five or their king nine suited they just check it or whatever. That they bet their ace-jack, ace-10, ace-9 every single time. So very, very often this is the way more beautiful thing because people cannot react to it. The mistake already happened. You can exploit them. If you bet there and you're over bluffing, the villain can, in theory it's rock-paper-scissors game. He can just do a call, do a fold, do a call, do a fold and he can make a decision now. If he gets there with bullshit range he can't react anymore. Obviously he can't start calling like king and jack highs here. Well he can but that's doesn't won't help right. So this is how I want to split it up for you guys. Another very typical scenario is check check check now different spot but that people are just like it's beautiful card for us but still he should find bluffs that people are never bluffing four or five four six and they always end up folding that this is just very very very and they bet ace jack ace ten all the time maybe take a smaller sizing whatever right that they are more face up and this is where the over main over folding comes from that people are not bluffing themselves bluffing the wrong hands and so on so this is the the mistakes i want to look for the most mistakes of the past this means it means attack ranges that contain lots of snap folds especially those that villain forgot to bluff this is the most beautiful spot so obviously against those people if they do something i don't necessarily want to river race but against those that check their value hands i don't necessarily want to bet check bet bluff so it's always still a rock paper scissor game seems so easy if i just talk about it but most of the time we don't know and it's our job to figure things out How do they deviate? How can we learn from that? How do they think? And then the weaker players are I said it already the more we can do about our sizing We know they are never check-raise bluffing. We bet a certain amount that our hand wants. That's it. All right Let's go back to the example Not this one, but of clubs check check river queen i mean here the solver is checking queens almost 100 on the on the oh here it was check check now oh it still works right let's let's play jack check check villain is not check raising enough why in this world should i bet four big blinds with my freaking pocket queens i mean we we can bet three times pot. He will find something to call They people always find something to call if not, we bluff that it's our card. We bluff it. It's okay So feel free to take your side like if you end up checking ace ten twice, why not bet eight point five? Might so say you're free to do that Well, if this check raising is not Not that villain. I know enough people that just bet their queen seven all day long here because they have, I don't know, two pair, obviously. Okay, let's go. Exploited thoughts. I hope that's enough for that. Again, rock, paper, scissor. We need to find out. We have that here, mistakes of the past and future that can help a lot to really understand where people can react and where they can't okay that brings us to the last slide just 20 minutes too much today that's okay with a little trouble we had i hope it was fine for you and i tried to figure out things that we have it for the platform as well try my best and yeah key takeaways know the spot you are in now we talked we split up the spots the more you are aware of the spot you are in the more good decisions that you have trained you will make adjust correctly to learn sizing and putt outs the sizing is important right very very often we just think like oh we are losing anyways we're losing anyways that's at least my feeling For a nit like me and therefore i use the phrase a lot when i see a sizing it's like am i winning more than x percent if he bets half pot am i winning more than like every fourth time and then it's easier to answer yes or no right instead of does he have it this time doesn't he have it i think he's bluffing we don, right? So it's about it's about a range he's playing We need to find like only a couple of bluffs or do I need him to bluff a lot if he's like over overbetting? Alright, and then again attack weakness not strength like but but we can represent a set here with our three combos on that Revered Queen like yeah, fuck it. It's like if he has an ace and it's not crazy folding no it's about finding the weak spots like he's not bluffing this he's double checking this he's not protecting his range there this is why he's folding 60 instead of 40 very easy and now we have learned big time that unblocking weak hands is more important than anything else unblock bluffs unblock the hands you want to fold out we use smaller sizes, and this is actually like this small ball, it seems like small ball nothing big happens, five big blind pot here, seven big blind pot here, four big blind pot there, four big blinds is tough if we raise to 2.5 actually. But anyways, this is where we make our maybe some red line also, I don't know, but where we just like build our win rate without variance that's important another key factor is just evaluate how good the run out is for your range i didn't mention that so far but on average is it a good card if you are unsure you go for the bluff if it's a very bad run out if you're unsure just know sometimes giving up is fine so this is like very very easy rules to have a better idea how to navigate through those spots that come up every session. This is one of the beautiful spots you can filter for it you have it every single session so this should help you to play every single session a little better.
