### TOPIC: cash stack sizes
 Let's start right away. We'll be talking about different stack sizes. And actually, before I show you, that should be named differently. This is called different stack sizes here. But now, a big question to you, the why, right? We will first talk about why is it important to talk about playing against, I think this is pretty obvious, and with different stack sizes. Let me know in the chat. Stack off thresholds vary with stack size. That's very important to know. Absolutely. We will talk about that as well. But is that a reason that you will decide, okay, this time I'm just playing with 50 big blinds. Tomorrow I'm playing with 100 and in two days, I'm playing with 200. Probably not. Helps with range analysis and how to make our EV with our hand depending on stack size. Yes. I mean, again, I'm more talking about our decision to sit down with a certain amount of big blinds. People might not be well versed in certain stack sizes, so that might generate edge. Very good, right? So for example, if there is a big recreational sitting with 200 big blinds, I definitely sit down with 200, even though I'm way better with 100 big blinds than I am with 200, right? Just because it's relative. If I'm way better in one part of the game than my opposition, I should play that. If everyone is like the best 100 BB players in the world there, and the recreational is only sitting with 20, maybe I should only play 20 to decrease my negative edge against the tough competition. Let's say four times line of love. And obviously with 20 big blinds, I keep the same edge over the recreational, whether I sit there with 100 or 20. Actually, I increase it, but we'll get to that later. The better your opponents, the worse it is for you to have a bigger stack, partly. Short stacking if we are taking shots, interesting, to decrease variance, right? Without without giving up ev that's always a double-edged sword playing deep when spots are deep as well to increase spots in the sense of recreational players absolutely never more different three bed four bed sizes that's absolutely true but not really uh answer to the question drag them out of their comfort zone very good right it's like really that relative edge this can go in the positive and in the question. Drag them out of their comfort zone. Very good, right? It's like really that relative edge. This can go in the positive and in the negative sense, right? So now a different question to give you a hint into another direction. We have the image of a table here now on my screen. I don't have one right now. And in which direction, if everyone is same skill level, are the chips flowing? Is that clockwise from my perspective now or anti-clockwise? Clockwise, right? All right. So actually we have one more thing, right? It's always you have position on the guy to your right. So actually it's like, yeah, usually the guys in position have the edge. That means if people on your right are having big stacks, you want to cover them. If people on your left have big stacks and those on your right only have like 40 big blinds, even though you might have edge, they have position, right? So there's more to think about. So now we've learned already a couple of things that we can really put into our game and talk about, well, this is the first decision that makes our win rates with how many big ones we sit down. Sure, we take like 100 if we sit down in Zoom pool, because we cannot influence tail. Now, the reason why maybe Zoom is not the highest win rate possible game, but there's something really, really cool. And now let's get to that, to the why, to my answers here. Now we talked about way more already. Obviously, the why we should talk about playing versus different stack sizes is that we face all kinds of stack sizes, right? If villain decides to play like that, we should be good in that game. If not, he can put us out of our comfort zone. I can tell you one thing. One guy who loves open seating because he's a really good heads-up player or like partly really good heads-up player is kind of cheating. Not in the cheating sense, but in kind of common sense, because he specialized in 50 BB heads up poker. This is unfair because he can open sit even though he's not the best player. And usually when you sit down and someone is better, they just sit down and either you play heads up and you lose, which is fine for the other one, or you just leave. And this guy has the open seat. That's usually worth something. The higher the stakes, the more important that is. But this guy is not the best player in the common sense of deep stack, but he's the best at 50 big blinds because this is what he studies all the time, where he found a little niche to secure him open seats, getting the best seats against recreationals. And then he loads up once it's a ring game. He's good in ring game. So very, very smart. Now, one thing that I expected you guys to mention. So short stacks have an advantage. Can someone explain to me why? Higher equity realization. That's the correct answer. Easier decisions can get stacks in. It's impossible to deny their equity, right? They only need to care about their success. That's correct. I'll give you one example. Say we play three-handed to keep things simple. The button plays 20 BB. Small blind is 0. Plays either 20 or 100 BB. And big blind is playing 100 BB. So now button open raises. If you play 20 big blinds, what are you doing with ace queen offsuit? Hero, all in, 20 big blinds. What happens now if the big blind wakes up with pocket kings? Call all in, right? And button calls, calls, who cares, right? So we run the board and win a solid amount of the time, ace queen versus king king, right? If we have 100 big blinds, we don't realize our equity, right? Sure, we play different strategy then probably not all in. We may be three bet to like six or seven big blinds, but then big blind can implement bluffs as well and so on. So you see the point. We secure that the money is going in with our short stacks that we realize the equity. Even if it is just like a random flush draw post flop, same thing happens, right? Different spot. And now we play 20. We have the advantage, right? Because now what happens is they can fight each other, right? Let's say, but no raises. We somehow flat, big line flats, right? So let's say we have, I don't know which hand we are flatting there. Let's flat freaking King 10 offsuit for the sake of it, right? And the board is 10, five deuce. Let's just say we check, big line checks, button, that's half pot. Let's just check jam for the sake of the example. Big blind, then let him just jam, right? Jam, And once we say we have four six of spades, button folds, maybe kings, right? Could be the jam, right? Jam. And once we say we have four six of spades, button folds, maybe kings, right? Could be the case, right? Maybe not on that board, but something that is more connected where the kings are really scared. But you get the point, right? That because those guys have fold equity against each other, then we benefit from, right? So this is now why whenever there's the same skill level or whenever you watch high stakes, you see lots of players buying in short. The shortest stack has an advantage. It's just how it is. We just play deeper because we think deeper, our edge is bigger. Only when you have edge, you should play deep. This can be either position. This can obviously be skill advantage. This can be the spot on the table. They are the effective stack. Exactly. This is kind of your goal. So now this is the main thing. This understanding short stacks have an advantage. You can play your 20 big line perfect. If you play, but you sit down with a hundred and other people have a hundred, you're still losing to the 20 big line stack. If he is as good as you are even slightly worse, that's a big problem. Right? And the next point is the skill advantage. We want to cover the people we have adjunct. So usually a game is running because there is one guy who is clearly worse, or everyone thinks that there are someone who is worse. We want to cover that guy because winning a hundred big blinds makes more money than winning 20 big blinds. Right? So this is why there is a game and why I'm a big fan of like some kind of minimum buy-in. 20 big blinds, minimum buy-in is a bullshit cash game because of that reason we are forced in a way in tough competition to buy in short. Not even Linus is probably buying in short. So yeah, just that understanding is pretty important. All right, let's see what is next. General ideas. Now talking about different stack sizes. I hope that understanding is clear. We need to adjust the stack sizes if we are not playing the actual effective stack is always to our disadvantage, right? Because we know what would be the best strategy with 20 bigs, but we cannot execute it because of stack sizes. Now coming to different stack sizes in general and my general ideas to that. In my poker mind, how I see the game, I see that as a multidiscipline sports, right? Especially MTTs, you have lots of different, different disciplines, different stack sizes, different situations, ICM, pre-bubble, post-bubble, early game, late game, final table, and so on. It's like the bounty is a very good point, very different discipline. And you can be good at some of them. You are never, never, never good at poker, right? This is just impossible. It's like saying I'm good at athletics. Or sure, you can say you are good at football. It's fine, right? But probably, is Cristiano Ronaldo good at football? If we break it down to defending, he's probably bullshit. Now, even talking about Messi, things can even burst probably. So there are different part disciplines where even the best overall guys are shit. This is something we need to understand. Different stack sizes are nothing else but different disciplines. You can think you're the best cash game player. Maybe you are on the table with 100 big blinds. But now I told you the story about that smart guy practicing 50 big blind heads up all the time, crushing everyone in that sense. Really, he's outplaying everyone in that sense. He's clearly worse with 100 big blinds than most of the tough competition up there. But no one else studies 50 big lines. This is his edge. If there is minimum buy-in of a hundred big lines, he's fucked up, right? So Stefan Goodenvold, not at all. No, I'm tall, right? I'm tall and I want, this is my skill set. I'm not. So really see that and know where you're good at. Is it a hundred big lines? Is it 200? Is it 300? One big learning for me is I need to reset my stack on Zoom when I'm like above 300 big blinds because I have no clue of pre-fault ranges anymore. Like just didn't have any bluff 4-bets or like I didn't know when I faced 4-bets what to do, like 300 big blinds, be like, I don't know. Or I did that. I looked at the pool and see like, is there a big recreational with 300 big blinds? That would be a reason to stay with that. If not, I can just rejoin with 100 or I'm happy to play up to 200 or like actually 150 is my line where I feel very comfortable. So I can do that. Why? It's cool to have a big stack. Super cool. Take pictures. I had like a picture of like one night where I was sitting like two tabling zoom or at least two tables. I ran really good and I had like a thousand big blinds here, a thousand big blinds there. Yeah, I loved it, but it's probably was not a smart decision. Okay. So now coming to something that you talked about already, our racetrack. Coming back to one of the other coachings I held. So I hope the word racetrack is not that new to you. The racetrack looks different. For everyone that didn't hear that before, make sure to check out all coachings I gave the last three years. It's, in my sense, the way that we navigate through a pot to the kind of the goal of being all in at some point. That's the racetrack. Like we bet small, we want him to check raise, then we call, then it's a turn bet, maybe we raise, whatever, right? There's kind of a plan for each hand, how things should go when there's like strong hand versus strong hand. And here the racetrack, let's say in easy words is very, very short when the stacks are shorter, right? Because it's just, we risk less. We're not risking a hundred big blinds when we go all in. It's just like 20 big blinds if we are that short. So risk reward is different and we need to defend way, way, way more. So we need to stack off a different percentage of our range. And here, this is just my personal definition, right? Everyone has like his experience definition of what we count as nuts. We just need to understand that nuts in my sense, it's hands that just need to go in the middle, right? Even if we win or lose, it's like both nuts. And it's just a certain amount of hands. Any clue, I'm just asking for like a standard single raised pot, 100 big blinds deep. Like let's say button open raises 2.5 big blinds, big blind calls. So there's like 5.5 big blinds in the middle, 100 left. Which percentage of your range do you need to stack off? More or less? There's a rough number to do some quick, easy math. Maybe not that easy, but it's an easy number. 10% someone is playing too loose. That's just about 5%, right? I'll do the math. This is what usually in private coaching always goes wrong when I try to do it on the go, is we try to do it together, okay? So we have a starting pot of, let's say, 5.5. We stick to the 2.5. We stick to button versus big blind. We open race to 2.5x. Shorter stacks, we probably size down a little, and then it's a different starting pot. And now let's say stack size is 100 big blinds. So we have like all in pot of, let's forget the small blind for now and just name it 200, right? So now what we do is what needs to happen over the way, the racetrack, right Right here, I just want to play three streets. Let's just say one guy is betting three times. Right? Can be different sizes. You could obviously bet like 30% flop, 150, and then jam the river, like whatever is left. Would be slightly different numbers, but I make it easy and bet the same amount all the time. So now what I do is I divide the all-in part through what we have already. This year is, I call it the growth. We need to be all in. And now I take that, I don't know the English words for that. I take this number and do this year to go for three streets. So this is like which number that we multiply with itself and another time gets us 36. So 3.31 times 3.31 times 3.31 is what we need to achieve. So this year is the growth of the pot per street. Now we need to get to the bed size. So we have one in the middle already. Pot size is one. Just say that, right? 100% of the pot. So we add like stupid number, but I look like that. Minus one, right? So this year is what we add. And if we divide that by two, this is what each player puts in. So bet size, right? And now this is getting a little lost, but now anyone knows how to calculate minimum defense frequency. So now, you know, you face a bet size of 115% and you want to defend correctly in that minimum defense frequency theory. I know this is getting tough here with just writing down numbers. This is probably correct. I'm very bad with that. So I always go with the numbers. So he risks actually those 1.15 to win those back plus the pot. This is how often the bluff needs to work. And one minus this year is how much this guy needs to defend, right? So he needs this year. And he needs to do that each street. And my 5% were absolutely wrong because I had that in mind from 200 big plans probably. And this year are exactly the 10% that Jerome said. And he crushed it. And I called him out for an absolute perfect number. So this is now very nice just as a number for like that we end up with like 10%. Maybe I think I did it the right way that we can do it for different stack sizes as well, right? If we just play 50 big blinds, our all-in pot is 100. And we know now that we need to defend like 70% of our range. If we play 40 big blinds, it's about 20%, right? We can write down those numbers or it's more about a feeling. All in pot or if we just play 20 big blinds, we actually need to stack off freaking 30%. It's very, very easy numbers without really considering boards and anything, just understanding we need to defend more. And what I want you guys to do now is to have that understanding that that forces us to play very, very differently. What we need to do is to treat all the nuts versus nuts the same way as we treat like kings versus aces preflop. Everyone who played poker for a while is a little pissed, but not too much losing kings versus aces preflop because this is just part of the game and it happens in both ways. Actually, if we play 20 big ones and we flop king 10 or 10 9 versus king 10 and the money goes in the middle this is where i want you to treat it like kings versus aces it's like so often we have the thought we are all of us are too tight we always have that thought that uh maybe we can get away and so on and maybe it was too thin to belly bed or i shouldn't bluff here and so on and blah, where really we need to consider that as like, this is just nuts versus nuts going in the middle. Right? So really, this is the point where we can change our ideas. Because once we accept that money will go in the middle, and if it's nuts versus nuts, we are okay with it, we can focus on the right things. We can focus on the hand classes, on the hand types that we are actually interested in playing against, right? So if I have 10-9 on 10-5 deuce, I think about, ah, this guy has a five. This guy has a deuce. Let's get him. This guy has queen jack and I want him to fold it. Like, I'm not thinking about, ah, is it good? Is it good? And so on. No, I accept at that point that this is my kings versus potentially aces, but it needs to go in the middle and it's fine to just play it in a very, very aggressive way. Let's just have a quick example for let's say 20 big blinds. And I hope that backs up what I just said. Let's open raise our freaking button. Let the big blind defend, get this board of 10, five deuce, check button, seebets, and we are in the big blind with 10-9 now. I mean, all our tournament friends probably know that. 10-9, we just freaking check-raise, right? Because we need to fold our jack highs, queen highs, king highs, and need to get value from ace highs and king highs and from 5x, from 9s, from 7s, and so on. So we check-raise. This guy's calling. If he jams, we probably just stack off. I don't know. I guess so. Turn is a freaking, like, whatever card. Eight with a flush draw. Let's go. 10-9. Not a single thought about, like, are we good or not, right? Let's have a look at how are things, if the turn is really bad. Queen. Okay. Now, bad card. We re-evaluate. We bet our queen X, check. And now let's see what happens, right? We need to be ready to accept lots of those shifts, right? And this sizing and see, okay, we're in check call, but we could check jam also. Again, to deny equity, because our hand is good enough to actually stack off. If we're not doing that, we're just way too tight. And this is something that I expect pretty much everyone to be in lower stakes for sure. We make fun of people probably who like, we check raise 10-9, let's get a break out here. 8, you bet. Let's 10-9. We're allowed to bet all in sometimes. And maybe we laugh about people who stack off pocket sixes. Like, this guy just calls off sixes. We're like, no, he played it correct and that should be all all right. And if you wonder about that, you're just not bluffing enough. So stuff like that is very, very important. And for me, a big, big, big game changer was exactly this part to accept nuts versus nuts. All right, let's see. You once said you approach short stack way more like a three bet, four bet pot. Really helped me as well with understanding how quickly everything is going in the middle. Absolutely. Because you can transfer lots of your learnings, your knowledge with SBRs, right? Your own very quick answer. You get five seconds. What's the standard SBR in a three bad pod? Small blind versus button. Slick rich. This is more imposition. What I have in mind is like button makes it 2.5. Small blind makes it 10 button calls. So it's 20 in the middle plus the big blind we don't care about that so 200 is the pot we are aiming for there would be tens of five each or like actually a little smaller i never think in the sbr but this is this is easy math i'm not using it either it's more like a variance thing and now we could calculate the stack size we need to have kind of the same thing in a single race pot right so it's like we set 5.5 in the middle 25 big blinds deep it's the same shit kind of that where we see patterns of range construction and hand selections that fit to each other right three bad spots four bad pots are a lot like short stack poker yeah str is super important but you can just like have that experience that a three bad pot is a little like that and so on this more for like people that really play often different stack sizes but it's like more if you just play cash for i think your own it's like playing lots of zoom as well where just like you have the same spots over and over and then you don't need to know the number it's just you know the spots a little by heart all right now we talked about that already but i want to be more specific. Changes pre and post block is obviously what different stack sizes lead to. I wrote down to not forget examples. I actually split it up to put in a little, little quiz as well. We'll get to that in a second. So queen on the turn is not scary for a short with a 10 in that hand. We start checking because it's a good card for villain, but he still has so much shit that if he bluffs correctly, our 10 is a call mainly. I think we are indifferent on the river. Like our EV was close to zero, but just always check folding would be way too weak. Yeah, operator, that's correct. In the theory world, again, not saying that you should call down 10x there on NL5. So really just showing you can go berserk with your bluffs. If you look at GTO wizard and you see what people need to call down with that, because the shorter the stacks are, your reward stays the same. You win the pot in the middle, but your risk overall is your stack, right? If you try check raise, bet, bet, you only still, you can only risk 20 big blinds if you play 20 big blinds deep. So it's very, very easy that people overfold there. I think short stack, there's even more overfolding in those like strong lines. Because still, you face a check raise, you face a bet, you face another bet. But those sizes are tiny. Doesn't really matter in like human brain. All right, cool. That was the second slide, I think. Let's get to the next one. Preflop. One thing that is just a given thing. Whenever there is the risk of pacing and all in, we risk our equity realization. Could anyone break it down and tell me what I mean with that? So whenever there is the risk of pacing and all in, we risk our equity realization. What could that mean? Right. You can't bet fold anything with decent equity like draws. Might be priced out to see future cards, right? So let's say example 20 big blinds. You open raise pocket deuces on the button, big blind rejams. You know, you have like a break, even slightly losing call. And actually you look it up in GTO wizard and figure out you shouldn't have opened deuces or let's say on the cutoff in a non-anti environment, or maybe just you should have open jammed. Different strategies come into place. For 40 big blinds, this is different again. For 100 big blinds, it's like, yeah, you can open raise and then you just call and have ev in the hand with like certain hands so this is something and now again i talked before about risk reward that with shorter stacks the risk gets lower while the reward stays the same the pot in the middle so what we do to fight that is that we size down when open racing if we look in gto wizard the standard for shortest stacks is like 2x not bigger smaller is impossible decrease their reward right exactly and we don't need to protect or charge that much for the big blind defense because usually big blind defense is about trash hands and they live off implied odds right seven fours that make a straight to aces. Seven fours that make a two pair to crush aces. Stuff like that, right? So if they only win 20 big lines when they make their miracle hand, that's okay. So rejam trapping correctly is something. Another thing, we don't want to fold out hands that have barely no equity against us. We will slow play aces a little more, right? Nine deuce, rainbow. We can check back top set. Now this is, we are here pre-flop, right? But it's like button open raises, big blind. We probably defend pocket aces if we don't want to open up that tiny three betting range that we can have. I usually prefer to just play a rejam and then have like those super strong holdings in the calling range and play it from there. But yeah, different three betting ranges are a little different and so on. OMG, Kaihudi, exactly that. Against shorter stacks, we also have to flop, check back some hands with back row equity that want to see all five cards. Deeper, we can bet call. Exactly, right? 9-5 juice with one heart. You have king-10 of hearts. That calling sucks with small stack behind. That folding really sucks. So checking is the option, right? We polarize way more because there's lots of check raising happening or should if one is check raising we want to have easy decisions short stack i call it is a game of very easy decisions when you have a tough decision you made a mistake before more or less obviously there are tough decisions but this is something to break it down think like oh if i bet this flush draw on villain jams what am It's like, yeah, check the flush draw back in the first place. So it's all about equity realization. Brief flop, it starts here. Play passively versus short stack. That's not necessarily true to realize equity because they have the same problem. Yeah, it's just we need to decrease their reward. I think this was the perfect term. All right, let's have a quick look. I'm not talking about 20 big blinds only. We talked deep stack as well. So let's get to the first little quiz. We have the chat here. I want to see three freaking numbers from you guys. So I gave you one example, and I want to know what is our open raising frequency on the cutoff in GTO Wizard. Obviously, we can do anything we want. For 100 big binds, it is 29.3%, and we use a sizing of 2.5. It is obvious that lower, smaller sizings lead to the fact that we can open raise a little wider. So I put it in here. But still, I want to know the numbers for our cutoff open raising frequency for 20 big lines, 40 big lines, 200, or in this order here, 200 first, 40, then 20. I want to see incentives, right? Where is it the highest? Where is it the lowest? Maybe we understand the reasons behind that. And you just put in three numbers, right? So I make an example. It's like 200. I think we can open raise 50%, 40 big blinds. I love that. I'm just crushing. I go 75% and 20 big blinds deep. I'm very scared because I don't want to risk my stack and I go 10%. I just put down three numbers. First number is 200 big blinds deep. There's no wrong answers, right? I just want to see, test you a little. I'll give you the answer in a second, but I couldn't solve that myself. Just to test your brain a little. As many answers as possible. 35, 28, 25, 35, 25, 15, netly. Oh, 30, 26, 35. How wouldouni going crazy with 20 Bix. 35, 25, 23. And so this is interesting. Why should incentives change? If smaller stack means open raising less in the first place and then more again, that would be interesting. 24, 35, 25. Okay. 20, 25, 15. 30, 29, 26. Okay. Right. So lots of good numbers out there. I think the underlying reason is the value of position, right? So I didn't go for the button. On the button, it would be crazier, but I went for the cutoff. It's obviously mainly we will play cutoff versus big blind. So we have position. The deeper we are, the bigger our positional advantage is. So deeper stack size leads to more open raising. When in position on the button, even more. I think on the button, it's like 43 for 100 big blinds and it is 48 if you play 200. So really a big difference. Here, I think it's only, what is it? 29 to 30.1. But it's a cutoff because the button is still the captain. 40 big blinds, we have the shift of the bet size that kills things a little. So if we force for 200 big blinds to min-raise, we would easily go into like the 35, 36 region. I'm pretty sure. So we should see that gap as like way bigger than it looks like now. But 40 big blinds deep, we go like 29.6 with that small size. And then 20 big blinds here, we see the incentives. Villains can start re-jamming. Our positional advantage is very, very small now. Often we we are not playing three streets so the hand could be over pre-flop so it's only 26 exactly right it's all about the positional advantage that we have over the streets right so the same thing we could look into the small blind the deeper we are the less we should play from the small blind first in right because we have the positional disadvantage okay so right just understanding those incentives positional advantage it would be more clear maybe i should have taken the button but here it's still it's not like the button can do any crazy the main play will be cut off versus big blind here let's keep going i think post flop is next and then we are good in time to just give you some examples i I hope there was some stuff to think about. All right, post-flop. This time, yes, I did copy the last slide, but this time I did it on purpose. So we talked about that already because it's true for post-flop as well. Whenever there's the risk of facing an all-in, we risk our equity realization. This time I'm talking about open-enders on the turn, flush draws on the turn, something that doesn't want to bet full, something that is, ah, if we are unsure, check back. So now it's way more a game of equity. Let me show you something. We stick to the 20 big blind example, button open raises, big blind calls, 10-5 deuce. Tell me a hand that is checking back very often, a value hand that is checking back very, very often on that board. Pocket fives, not correct. Aces actually not correct. I thought aces is a thing here. I'm here i'm a little confused but tense tense would be the answer i was looking for right it's like really we block everything to death and we want him to hit usually when we play 100 big blind steep that is not happening because we need to start our racetrack we need to keep things going right we need to start building a pot right maybe we see some low fraction of checking here pocket fives you want this guy to guy to check raises 10-9 before it's check check and the turn is a king. Let's see pocket tens, now we build a pot. Some whatever bullshit check back here, but we want to build a pot because our racetrack is still a long track. It's a very long track to get all in here. So this is something that we see for 20 big blinds, for example, that short stack, we can trap. Let's get another board out. I'll test one more, four, five, six. This is the leading, okay? We play without the lead. Tell me a value hand you're checking back very often. Slick Ridge goes with the nut straight. Can anyone beat the nut straight pocket aces? Next try again with the aces. Let's have a look. I'm unsure myself. Ace three is not a value hand, but it's a very good one to check back. It's a very, very good answer. Aces is a very good answer. And Thanks for watching. try again with the aces. I'll have a look. I'm unsure myself. Ace three is not a value hand, but it's a very good one to check back. It's a very, very good answer. Aces is a very good answer and seven, eight unblocks the six X check raises, but it's not too bad. But here we see like more the draws, like ace three, no way we have ever freaking betting this, right? We want to hit an ace. We want to hit deuce. We want to hit a seven. We are not building a pot here and get check raised by 7x or by 8x. That's a disaster, right? 8, 9. No. King, king. Aces, exactly, right? to do is we want to hit a seven we are not building a pot here and get check raised by seven x or by eight x that's a disaster right eight nine no king king aces exactly right that's the typical pattern they want villains queen ten to hit queen jack to 10 9 to it and so on highest suited king exactly especially those with the back door let's go king nine we will see it oh actually not so because of the back door straight usually it's the one without the back door that you can bet a little more because the bed folding hurts less now here seems to be a special case but that is something usually to keep in mind all right so very very cool this is another option and this is explained by the short stick the racetrack is so short and now for you you know our racetracks right we have a starting pot here this is kind of a goal say 100 big blind goal so pot size 200 big 200 big blind, we plan, right? We start with our small bet. Let's take the freaking tens example, 10-5 deuce. We bet small. We hope that villain has something, check raises a gut shot or another set, right? Let's talk nuts over nuts, right? Then he goes crazy on the turn and on the river, he rips it in, right? Or he goes small again, we raise and so on. This could be our racetrack. All right, with with pocket fives we start small we go very big on lots of turns that's very big and then we jam ourselves on the river could be our more like the pocket fives that wants to get called by like a 10x or 10x2 pair something like that those would be our racetracks but now what happens is that we just shift things and the end of our racetrack is already here right so now let's kill that here end of our racetrack is here we're playing 20 big lines so pot size 40 is the end of it and we see already by that picture that well two streets are actually easily enough all right it's like what happens if we check back on 10-5-2s and the turn is a king what do we do with our trapped aces or with trapped tens who knows let's take this Check check. Turn is a freaking king. Out of position checks a lot. Oh, what a surprise. Pocket aces. Overbet. 5.6. Villain has to call a king or is actually indifferent already. Fuck his king. River is, I don't know, parrying the freaking four. Check. All in. All right. So now we let him hit, actually now it's only 80% left. We stack this freaking his freaking king queen. We didn't give up our chance to go all in by checking back the flop. We're like, okay, probably goes 2e here. Actually, it did not because there are so many peer plus draws. So he wants to overcharge on the turn. 2e would be more like 100, but I think it's very clear that aces wanted to go. It's very, very clear that they want to go big. see like we start if there was no equity shifts then we would always go to e but here with all those pierre postras we overcharge the turn because lots of rivers we are not value jamming anymore river seven river three river deuce deuce we might jam all right to e as a starting baseline and then shifting things a little is always a very good idea okay so happy with the paint this is how you can see things can see things. Where is the end of the racetrack, we are not giving up something talking about the value hands. Right? And now talking about always the risk of facing an all in. Why didn't we bet ace three? Oh, because this line might freaking exist that villain just rips it and we cannot call or I mean, we could make a minus ed call probably check. Let's say we bet first button ace three. What's the highest frequency bet? Let's take the small. Well, let's take the 1.5. Oh, 4% all in. That sucks. Even the small check raise, that sucks, right? Or like if that happens, there are other boards, right? Our ace three shouldn't exist. So we cannot look it up, but it sucks. All right. So now really, whenever there's the risk of facing an all in, we risk our equity realization. If you have like a flush draw plus high card on the turn, it won't be a bet. If there is a risk of villain going all-in. There are some boards where villain cannot really raise anything, then it's fine to push your equity. In position, if we are deep, we can bet like strong flush draws, maybe with like 12 order with gut shot on top. And if he raises, we can just call. Easy. Odds call. And then we play the river while we keep our positional advantage this is why we can do that deep at 200 big blinds the game is way more about pushing our equity we have equity we bet we bet not equity if he raises we call maybe we make nuts on the river and can build like nice all in range for 200 big blinds on lots of rivers then another thing that is very important now we are talking from the guy who's somehow defending, is denying equity. On 10-5 deuce, there was not really a single 10 that checks back. You need to fall on jack high, queen high, king high. There is something like balance does not really exist here because we check back nuts already. We don't need like medium strong hands that turn bluff catcher on lots of turns and rivers. No, they are good now go with them they need protection now we go with them so realize equity is very important by not needing to bet fold equity hands and denying equity to punish people who do that wrong is very important as well especially out of position if you're unsure what to do so many bad cards in the river your hand is good enough just rip it in like never a mistake just out of position if you think you play poorly the next street just don't play the next street right sounds stupid but if you don't know and you end up freaking ripping your ace eight offsuit here it's absolutely cool right because then you realize exactly the number you see here if villain plays perfectly if he doesn't play perfectly then that's usually good for us. So yeah, out of position, just lean towards putting the money in, positional advantage is gone. Easy money or no money, who knows. Six twos, rip it in, check raise small, whatever. Then you play a next street, which might be tough. But still, you give yourself a chance to jam the turn. That's the point here, right? Because then you eliminate one street of positional disadvantage. All right, now getting to the quiz. I think this is pretty clear that like the shorter we are, the more this is important. And the deeper we are, the more it is really about equity. And this, the shorter we are, the more we need to be aggressive for that equity denial and go with bullshit hands. We are not having all our draws. We are betting. so we need the nothing nothings. All right, let's go to the quiz. Guessing game number two. The post-flop one. What is our CBAT frequency button versus big blind on ace, five, four? And actually, I'm not asking for your CBAT frequency. I'm asking for GTO wizard's frequency. And I forgot to put in the 100 big blind one here. I think it's something about 40% for 100 big blinds. So again, I want to know three numbers for 200, for 40, for 20. And I want you to have one number correct of those three. Correct in the sense of plus minus five. 30, 55, 70. We need a tournament player. All right. So now what changes those things? It's not equity over time, right? The deuce and the three and the six eights and the seven eights and the six sevenths that make nuts is big, big, big, big blind advantage. The ace kings that Button has, ace queen that he has are not strong here. So this is the reason why 200 big blinds, we need to bet less. 20 big blinds, any ace is nuts because we have here a different factor that ranges are very different. For 20 big blinds, all the ace X or like most of them are rejamming-jamming. So actually those ace-high boards are incredibly good for the button. And we'll actually, I think GTO Wizard shows 97, but 100 was the answer I was looking for. So here we see the 35, 51, and then the 97. So just because here, something to know, different discipline, very different ranges, 20 big blinds. Big blind just doesn't have an ace. What are you actually doing with pocket sixes here is you bet big because pocket sixes is the nuts on ace, five, four. Pocket kings, you can bet big. It's the nuts. Probably you are not betting big because you want him to continue with queen, jack. So very clear, but you see how this is something where you can test yourself. What I like doing in GTO withers is really do that, right? What's the difference here? It's super fast here. Same spot. I just go to 100 big blinds. And usually it takes over the spot. That was a very bad example. But yeah, not going too deep here because I have two minutes left. And one more guessing game. Guessing game number three. We three-bath big blind versus button. And the board is 10-5-2s rainbow. What is your preferred sizing with jacks? You have jacks exactly on a 10-high board. For 100 big blinds, I tell you it's 75%. What is it for 200 big blinds? What is it for 40 big blinds? What is it for 20 big blinds? 120, 33, 25 as the first answer. 150, 75, 25, right? So now we have, again, two things working against each other. And you figured that out perfectly, right? So what you guys did is, how big do i need to bet to fulfill my racetrack to have a chance to get all in at some point right obviously for 20 big ones 40 big ones we can bet way smaller and still get all in at some point the problem is that pocket jacks for 200 big lines are not nuts anymore villain actually has like a set advantage and we need to react on the turn a lot so we cannot go too crazy right actually if it was 300 big blinds deep we would need to size down again this is the answers here it's actually already a 75 50 mix because our goal is not to go directional in for 40 big blinds end up 50 but like if you put in 40 or something like that and for 20 it's very small because villain is incentivized to fast play his 10x we don't need to do anything about that our hand is just just pretty nutted. Exactly. 200 bigs, what are you getting called by? For 200 bigs, jacks are just not good enough. So you try to get like 100 big blinds in and kind of take the same size and then have an unfortunate riverbed fold on like lots of runouts. Cool. So you see lots of different things working for and against each other here. The racetrack, but the different ranges as as well keeping in mind what is nuts to focus on the hands you actually want to play against everything that is nuts versus nuts given the stack size is just you should treat it as kings versus aces the key takeaways i want you to understand why you choose to play a certain stack size actually we got way more reasons to play certain stack size today than I expected us to. Position, recreational, the advantage as the short stack itself, the 50 BB story of that guy, kind of impressive. And then obviously knowing the discipline you are playing in right now. What I like doing there, or I did as a tournament player, because the discipline shift way more is just talking to myself. I'm playing 40 big blind deep single raise pot. Boom. Your brain switches into that zone. I'm playing 200 big blinds deep. Things change. It's not like, oh, eight, six, twos is a board where I bet big on. No, depends on the stack death. Maybe you can record an add-on if you play a VIP game where you buy in short. Maybe I can do that, but I'm not good short. That's the problem. So I would only do that with a big whale that buys in short that are deep, just better than me. So it's like tough. All right. And then spot mistakes based on stack size. People play boards the same way, but sometimes it's wrong for a given stack size. Lots of people play 200 big blinds exactly like they play 100. This is where we can really hurt them, right? Because then we can leverage that. Playing 200 bb deep still going for the all-in buttons using bigger sizes people can't handle it that's pretty much it just really playing for the whole 200 big plans it's not that i usually give that picture that people have this stack here they only want to use this because they are used to those 100 big lines it would be cooler if that was full but right it's like mtt sitting there with 300 big blinds, but actually only using 40. Use what you have. This is all something to put pressure on. Right. Thanks for being here. I'm out of here now and see you for the next one. Talk to you in Discord. See you soon, guys.
