### TOPIC: cash turn donking
 This is our schedule. Let's talk about the spot. What are we talking about is, um, yeah, the turn dog, which means villain is the aggressor at this time. Usually we have lots of spots where we are the aggressor. Whenever we talk about things where we look at both sides, I'm more taking the aggressor side, setting the parameters, choosing things here. It's a little different. So villain has to be the aggressor either like open raised or whatever, like the last street. So he be the flop aggressor last time and let's say we call a c-bet out of position on the flop and yeah then it's on us on the turn we might donk maybe we don't donk whatever right this works in lots of scenarios this can be a three-bet pot as well where we check all the flop and then lead out. It can be something like blind versus blind, where actually we are the pre-flop aggressor, but we check the flop and we check call a bet. So actually like initiative turn to the flop, and then maybe the turn is a good card for us, like let's say an ace, and we lead out again. This would be a turn donk in a way as well. But the typical spot, let's say we talk all the examples today, or mainly will be about big blind defense. We check call a flop bet, we lead out on the turn. Thank you. donk in a way as well but the typical spot let's say we talk all the examples today or mainly will be about big blind defense we check call flop bet we lead out on the turn all right let's go from there if there are any questions drop them in the chat happy to answer everything and yeah let's see what's next why taking over initiative and so when are we donking donking does not mean anything but like putting some money in the middle. We didn't talk about bet sizes so far, but I can already tell we are mainly talking about small sizes here. So for putting money in the middle, on average, you want to have an advantage. If you don't have an advantage, it doesn't make sense to build a pot. It's like usually one player has more of an advantage. That's the guy who is like more interested in building a pot does the majority of the betting. This is where all those 100% checking ranges come from, and so on. So to think about a donk, we need to have some kind of advantage, which is very, very tough if we decided to not check raise the flop. And yeah, so this brings us to the first very, very, very when we should think about dunks and this is mainly when we have very defined ranges right it's like really that we know this is what villain has this is what he did represent on the flop and this is what we have and this turn card in a way helped us more than him that's pretty much the whole whole story. We'll start with paint games here in a second but yeah first of all I want you to guess or to tell me which spots you are that fit to that narrative here that you are thinking about donks or that you know where donking is good and what needs to be the case. Maybe you think about a defined range. How do we get there in the first place? Which advantage changing cards are your favorite ones? What needs to happen? You can give me a hand example. You can try to describe it with words. Everything is fine. I want to get like at least I will read out like three or so out of the chat. It's really there's no wrong answer even if you are a super beginner just like your answer is very very appreciated and i can i can work with that so yeah you can tell me your favorite dunking spot in your words with a hand example whatever you feel like you are you're confident in typing in here again nothing is wrong and yeah i'll just give you a minute and And then we'll see what we're getting. And then I can explain a little more how I think about it. multiple people writing that's that's a good sign like to donk when i gain a flush or straight draw equity on the turn so you're talking about like a weaker hand like this sounds like a equity bluff right that maybe i can rephrase it because that's a very very typical hand class those hands that want to see more cards but are not happy to check call like a bigger bet right like something it's like a in a way a block bet that only works in theory when we have the advantage if not it's just blowing up the pot and villain should raise a lot but obviously can work against weaker players just like setting the price so very very good spot right something like we have like a gut shot on the flop we add Thank you. raise a lot, but obviously can work against weaker players, just like setting the price. So very, very good spot, right? Something like we have like a gut shot on the flop. We add a low flush draw on the turn, something like that. Or we just have a backdoor flush draw and we gain something, or we have a weak open ender, something like that. All right. Big blind defense, never more. It's this big blind defense, low card on the turn, which gives me two pairs straight advantage. All right so the low card with two pairs straight advantage I like because this is some super nuts. The two pairs is usually not many combos. Say low card on the turn let's say we have like a queen six four so you are talking about like a five like a three like a deuce something like that definitely definitely makes sense or sense or is not horrible to dunk. Maybe not the favorite spot, but it might make it into the optional category. All right, here's the first thing that I love, right? So very, very advanced answer here from Tsubano. At least I read the first three words and I call it advanced, but yeah. Versus polar range flop. We have to fold more. Okay, I expect something else. To fold more second or third pairs less in in-position range, so bluff do not improve. We improve having equity in bunch, we have to put the money in. I'm not sure whether I get it right, but there's lots of things in there that are important for me. So Tsuby says, I call it Tsuby, that's like an old school legend. If it's really you you like you studied the same place i did but i doubt it so the real sub is probably look i don't know whether he's still in poker but then i would love it so shout out to everyone from card school here and so the thing is talking about defined ranges a polar range means polarized good hands and bad hands and usually when you build a range like that, a batting range, you use a big sizing, which means that us, as the defender, we are allowed to fold a lot and have a very defined range, right? For a big size, villain needs to select and choose his hands well, but we are allowed to fold a lot and choose our hands well also, right? It means, let's say, queen something, something, villain has something like a strong queen or pocket kings that's like his value maybe some sets and we have the draws we have the middle peers with the backdoor flush draw and so on so it's very clear which player has which cards and therefore we can really read a lot into the turn card. Let's say queen four deuce the turn is a king is a king after a big bet. Yeah, fuck it. We can't do a shit. If it's like a four, that's maybe cool. Maybe it's like a three or a five. We connect to some straight stuff. Or if it's even there was a flush draw and now the flush gets there, it's maybe us having that a little more. Because obviously, we continue every flush draw. But villain is not necessarily betting big with every flush draw. That's very cool. So this is a big part, polarized ranges, big sizing for defined ranges. This is the very, very first. And we will see that a couple of times today again. It will be in the key takeaways for sure that we focus on spots where Willen told us something about his hand and telling something poker is usually not verbal, but by using a large sizing. Telling I have it right now, and then something changes, and we say, sir, we have better now. That's kind of the whole story. Okay, where the board peers and in position has no cover. So maybe they bet big on 965, they would present pocket. I don't like 965 with the straight up there, but let's take 9, 6, 4 maybe, but your 9, 6, 5 is also okay, right? So they have pocket 10s, pocket jacks, ace, 9, and a 6 comes. Obviously, we have 6, 7, we have 6, 8, we have ace, 6, and so on. And they won't bet many any 6-axis, right? They don't have it, we have it. Next very important point, we need to look at both sides. We need to relatively improve to villain. If it's us making lots of trips, it doesn't help if villain also makes lots of trips. I expect it and I'm super happy to not read that, to just randomly see that where people are actually docking way too often, like the middle card from the flop pairs. It's a very very good spot in certain situations but if let's say the villain open raises under the gun and c-bets small on king queen deuce and the turn is a queen. Hell no it's not a great card for us this guy is range betting has every good queen has the sets like the straight draws. It's like no, it's like a small size. This means we need to continue all kinds of garbage. Obviously we have a queen also but not the good ones and so this is something that we really need to take into account. All right so good spot stuff here from Kid Carry. Swivel Seal. I like to dunk on turn big blind on low flops versus early position where we check ball small on the flop and the turn here is a card that is heavily in our range. Kind of the same thing? Exactly. Now, maybe I'll ask another. Let's continue that. I like dunking when my top pair arrives on the turn but there is still a draw and I unblock. Okay, that's clearly targeting something very, very special, very, very, very defined. Now, when turn, put a draw on the board and I have top pair top pick or a better and want to protect my hand, very good thing against recreationals, right? Now I want you obviously in theory to evaluate ranges a little more. Villain, if it's a good card for him, should bet himself with his draws. And for us, it's not about protection in a spot. fall the flush draw but it's about it but it's about building a pot with 65 equity or so or 80 equity or whatever so this is it so now another question you guys all in those spots all you named lots of great spots you want to dock what is your goal of the? And I can let you know there's usually multiple goals. So multiple options for good answers. Drawing the pot size is a very good thing because we already figured out we have an advantage. When we have an advantage, making the pot bigger is good for us. Getting better to fold. I don't like that word. You mean the right thing, but getting better to fold I don't care about. Here we go. Frenzy gets it right. Preventing imposition from easily realizing equity by checking back. Exactly. I want him to fold hands that would check back and see a free river when those hands have equity. So this is something where we get to the low boards especially. You talked about low boards, you named lots of low boards because then we have something let's take this 6-5-3 board, we'll then see that something like Jack-10, like Queen-10, like Queen-Jack. All hands that have six outs to hit a freaking top here and we sit sit on all those low pairs, 9s, well what does it just say? 6-5-3, turn is a 5. If we donk small, he sits there with his jack-10, queen-10, over cards, whatever, six-outer, but it's shit, I face a small bet. Like either he pays the price for his shithand and pays us, grow the pot, gives us value, or he folds and throws away like 12% equity to beat us. Or given position, he should over-realize. Let's say he has jack-10. This is my logical example always. He wins when he hits a jack. He wins when he hits a 10. And because he is allowed to bluff sometimes also, let's say if he he hits a queen that's like his bluffing card that he's allowed to do so it's like he has more outs than that so i count that more like he has nine or actually ten cards now that that he can hit and then wins which is more like 20 equity not like equity to improve and we check down but i guess you get the point that's just bad stuff happening for us compared to the to the we donk and then he falls there's very good stuff and this can be something if we have it and will unfold something that can somehow get better than our hand then this is also great right so it's like whether this this is why i don't like the phrase of like we want better to fold I like him to fold his jack high when I have a five. That's great. That's a lot of equity. I also love him to fold. If I have a top pair king and he just folds an ace five, nothing. It's still three outs. I fold it out or a random. I don't know. I mean, he won't fold a gut shot if I don't small, but any kind of equity is good. Okay. Equity pushes versus equity nudges. I don't know. I mean, he won't fold a gut shot if a donk is small, but any kind of equity is good. Okay. Equity pushes versus equity nudges. I don't know the word nudge, if that is a word, or I don't know. It seems to be a word. Mammoth doesn't seem like the guy who puts in typos here. Do not allow imposition to check back. Here we go. Nice. Strange question. How small of a donk should the villain be calling the two overcards on the turn? We could look that up against like the typical like 25 to 33 percent he will always be indifferent but this is always an output of the range we are donking. The more shit we put in there the more he should just float there or even think about raising. So yeah this is the sizing that we attack with our, let's say 25% sizing. Right. So villain has the option, 25% sizing, 30% sizing. Villain can call those 25% to then play for a total like this. This year, you need 16.6% equity to make that call if the hand was over, he has he has the the position on his side one more card to come so one more street where he can outplay his position so usually he has like 12 equity with those so this is kind of where it makes sense right if we give him price here my example was 25 he needs that he has 12 plus positional advantage he hates it this is our goal not whether it's then maybe in other spots we can even donk smaller in other spots maybe slightly bigger depends on the value of his over cards and so on right so but this is a typical typical thing where we understand what our goal is one goal deny equity another goal the pot. Our nuts especially want to grow the pot. Our weakish showdown hands that have overcards against it, they just want to deny equity. Exactly. Mammoth says EAR here. It's the question, how good is EAR? If EAR is really EAR, I don't need it to fold because like denying equity from zero percent is like no equity denial so you won't see many dongs on like ace king deuce like if villain has six seven i don't give a shit give him give him some rope let him do whatever right i don't need that to fall out so six five deuce five is maybe more interesting okay we also want them to continue and not just fold when we have value, when we donk at some spots. So we can donk for building pot, not just pushing out equity. Exactly, two goals at the same time, right? The jack-10, let's say, has 12% equity against lots of our hands. But against another hand class, it's drawing dead. And actually, then we want him to continue, hit the the freaking jack and then build a huge pot. All right, so another goal, keep a little bit different. Well, that's an outcome of the plans we're doing to not give him good options, right? So this is not really a goal itself, it's a strategical goal, but not a goal inside the hand. Okay, very good stuff, I like it. Let's get to that, and I think I tried to explain most of it with words already, I will still represent it with paint. If I wrote down paint games here, we'll have a quick look. Alright, so what happens? First of all, we talk mainly about defined ranges, and Zuby said it with the polarized betting ranges. So now we have a look at, this is Willem, who did that flop? Say he polarized, so his range looks something like this. Something strong, maybe not super nutted. Jacks on 9-5-2s will be an example. And like some okay equity hands, right? Like some over cards, whatever, backdoor flush draw, something like that, but probably not too many of those mid pairs. Then us, because of the bet, you're calling a block bet. Because of us facing a big bet, we obviously fold all that here. Depending on the board, we will also not have super nuts in our range. Right, because we check-raise them. Sometimes we trap them also, so that might help. We end up mainly here, have lots of that stuff. Some draws, some medium strong hands, and so on. Like some nut draws, wherever you want to place them. And then we need this turn card. And what is important is that we have an area from here that gets in here, right? That it is, let's say here is strongest villain's hand, that we make nuts, right? That we have something that gets stronger. And actually what is very good also if something goes there. Like a gutshot that did not improve is weaker on the turn. That we have some nice bluffs as well. And important is that those hands here, this here has equity against our medium strong hands. Like random mid peers and these are the over cards. That's the example. I know this is wild. I hope it's somewhat understandable. So really we need first that polarization. We want to see that big bet because if it's a small bet, it's still wide range versus wide range. It's very, very tough that the turn card gives us such an advantage if ranges are still wide. Usually the open raiser just has such a big advantage with all his over-peers and so on that as long as ranges stay wide he's just over all. Maybe he has like, we talked 200 combo ranges and now we have like eight nut combos more. It doesn't matter really, depending on stack death. But yeah, so this is the main point. We need a big size that we think about lots of donking and we need the beautiful turn card that gives us new nuts. All right. Next Picasso. Great. All right. So I hope this is understandable. If not, just drop more questions and I'll try to answer them. So why taking over initiative? We have advantage. We build a pot, and another part of our range benefits from villain folding something, fold equity against hands that have equity. Right, let's take maybe the first example. Oh, the optional spot. Did I kill? There's one slide missing. The main spot just got killed. Maybe I didn't do it. So the main spot, we just do as an example. That's great. So yeah, somehow I killed that, maybe misclicking. Okay, cool. Do you like the line where if you hit a big hand on the flop and dunk on the turn against an aggressive player knowing he will re-raise you? That's rock, paper, scissors game. If I know that, and I know this is the best, like this is lots of information that we need if i'm checking he does he probably bets also so it's like there is i have one note and that's like you can tickle him it's like i write it down obviously not in english but for all the german speakers like i actually write that down where like i tickle him a little with the small bets and he just like tanks tanks comes up with the race it's more like a river thing that like I I go for thin value whatever like tiny block bets 10% bets and so on on the turn it's too wild as as long as it's early in the game I stay way closer to theory and for your example I need such an incredible read to make that work, that I really overrule my strategy. That is, I think, very tough to have, but I can see that absolutely on the river. So yeah. Cool. Let's go to the main spot. I think you named it already, right? We face even, let's take an extreme example, an overbet on the flop and the main spot being we check call and the turn pierce the board. In some spots the mid card is the best, in some spots it's even it's the top card even. So you'll see that in a second. So I'll guide you through it quickly. Just gotta figure out my computer here. Dunk more if you think... Would you dunk turn more if you think villain is just range betting most boards regardless of what they are? Yes. Yes, absolutely. Because then in lots of spots, in spots where they shouldn't range bet, their range is too weak and I can react to the turn card. Obviously I can already check raise more, but let's say he range bets all the low boards from like early position, middle position and so on. And there's another low card and I know he sits on jack, ten, queen, ten, queen, jack and so on, all that bullshit. We can put more pressure, right? This is now, we'll talk. This is one part of the exploitative thoughts. We'll get to later if we hopefully have time. But yeah, absolutely right people's ranges can be weaker and because of their mis misplays we we can have a donking spot also not just because their range is constructed in a way that they don't cover this card because they are too wide or they don't have that card it's like both two options right you can weaken your range on two ends by not having nuts or by adding way too much, way too much shit. This is what you talk about. The range bet there is a typical example. All right, let's get back to that later when we talk about the exploitative thoughts and now let's take example board. I use that example board in lots of spots, especially for the overbetting. First of all, we have button open raise, a big blind defense. We flopped 9-5-2's rainbow. Big blind is obviously checking range and the button does have an overbetting range. It does exist quite a bit. And yeah, oh boy, what is this year's strategy? This year, sorry, 21% of that. They said the other one was the flop report. So and and what we see is really this 10s, like nuts right now, not later. 10s, jacks, queens. And then the addition of like a jack, 10, a queen, 10, a queen, jack. They all have equity, overcards plus backdoor. So he is allowed to invest so much money because he has so many good hands right now. We don't have that. Plus, he can count on getting lots of better situations later as well. Knowing that you get in lots of good situations allows you to put lots of money in the pot on the flop already. And now it's our turn after calling, figure out, hey, the turn card changed something because it was not a good situation that came up. It's not a Jack, 10 not a queen not a king not an ace not a eight even right and now yeah i'll ask you i want to see three cards so don't write now three times the five or something three cards that you look for we call that big bet we think about donking on turn. I want to know the three turn cards you have the highest donking frequency. Or GTO Wizard has it. I mean, I don't know how you are playing. I wouldn't donk on a jack, for example. But you see the five of diamonds. That will be one of those, maybe. Subi goes for the 9-5-6. Any other ones? 5-6-8. 6-8 deuce. So, mhm. Cool. I'll show you the calling range. And that might help us. So we have the deuce. We see the deuce a couple of times because it's parrying the deuce and button does not have it after overbetting really, maybe some ace deuce. But to be honest, have it too often either we don't see a single deuce on the offset side we have those this is not many combos so the deuce is obviously a great card in the sense of villains jack ten queen ten queen jack didn't hit a shit so this is definitely a very good card for us in the sense of getting infinite nuts on top questionable all right what right? What about the five? The five is already way better. We have more of that on the suited side. We've all suited 5x. Ace-5 is 100% 3-bet. This is why it's not in here. But therefore we add some ace-5 offsuit, which is obviously quite some combinations, right? So this is beautiful. And what gets even better here is Villain does have some 9x himself. He can overbet with Ace-9 and King-9. But obviously, we continue with every single 9 we are having. And you see here, this is all offsuit combos. This is a lot. And then obviously, the cards like a 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 gives us straights that we probably have more than Villain after calling an overbet. We are not folding an up-gut shot. So we have that. We have more of those two pairs, so it's a good card but not a great card. So yeah, I think the nine is the best here. Five is also great and we'll just have a look. You already see like we see quite something. Report turns. We see the range donk on the 9. We see the almost ranged donk on the 5. And ace being also interesting because we check haul quite some ace highs and villain is more like 10, the jacks, queens and so on. And yeah, the deuce we see is okay. 3, 4, 6. 6 is pretty nice. 6, 7. So we see that the kind of the optional ones where we can do some damage, like a 6 against someone who range bets that board with the big size, I mean the range betting with the big size is wild, but you get the point I guess, would be great because the part of like his queen 10 not improving is just so strong for us. And yeah, the 9 and the 5 are the cards, right? So pretty, pretty cool. And now let's play a hand just once to the end. We donk small, 20% it is here. And now we see hopefully the reaction. This is the Jack-10 we talked about, right? Jack-10, Queen-10, it's all indifferent. They need to float sometimes, they need to bluff raise sometimes. It's just very, very tough to nail that. And yeah, it kind of sucks for Billum. Now, I want to know your strategy though, to just end, to play one hand till the end. the end tell me your strategy in easy words what you do on... After you donk, villain calls and the river is a seven of hearts. Just try in words what is your strategy on a seven of hearts on the river after donking the charm. So Mammoth with a check, the block and the jam, like answer that's never wrong somehow. Some big bets for 5X splitting this. Flexibility from the nuts, mainly betting small. The 9X we have a lot. We polarize since there's no point in denying equity anymore. What we take the value with our hands, so block bets do exist. It's obviously not equity denial anymore. Let's have a look, right? So this is important to figure out. What's Mammoth says that like this, here it's like an easy 320% jam that we see quite a bit of that, right? 10% of that, some other hands take 5% and then it's mainly block betting, right? It's like, who said it? Subhi with with the perfect answer I would say mainly betting small, right? Built around our 9x. This is the main part of our range. We still have mainly 9x after blocking the turn. We are not representing a 5 right now. We do that with that river, 320% jam. Obviously 6-8 got also there. 6-8, they are checking, right? We need to find the right hands that we trap there because obviously we trap something we check something like deuce or give up some some full shit and yeah finding something something like that right well finding bluffs is not that tough like ending up there with the six three just feels very very natural if you understand that we have the jamming range to rip it in and obviously that gets better like if people have not great great ranges there and they are never over betting with like a five for example which i think majority is doing is not doing then like i mean it's correct to almost never do that but then then it gets better and better right so uh i expected some king five suited some something like that so it's just some actually what i said you can forget that they should never have a five they they raise the turn with the good fives obviously and yeah we just sometimes run into the nuts and against that 320 percent jam they need to find some calls with tens jacks queens kings aces and so on uh which is obviously tough okay so i just want to show that quickly um this is the the spot. Low board, peering card that villain almost never has, and a river was even good also good for us. Okay, any questions regarding that? So this is what I would call the main spot. This is the one I wish that you find it the next time. Let's have a look at the 9 where villain is protected. Maybe another one. Kill the no flush draw makes it a little better for us. We block range. We have seen that already. Villain obviously raises quite something. He has the 9x himself. And after calling, we can find mainly a size for our 9x. I would say that it's not all in because villain is protected now, but we go like a very large size because with infinite 9x, that's kind of cool. Okay. Okay. Defer Dave, that's very good that you have that knowledge. You lack courage to jam river when stacks are equal but have no problems doing it when I have villain well covered. I guess this is a tournament thing, right? But yeah, doesn't make any sense in theory, right? It's like, it's not just this tournament is your session, so just playing best to your abilities overall, right? And it's like whether you have 200 big blinds or 100 big blinds and villain has, and he has 100, it doesn't matter. It's the same spot. Yeah, cash camp doesn't matter at all. There are obviously some future EVs, some stack size, whatever, that like ending up with a certain stack size in tournaments can have different values so that you are like risking more, maybe investing a certain amount, but probably it's just a little, but money scared, but like tournament life scared. Let's, let's take it that way. Yeah. A tip. Very, very, very typical, I would say, but knowing that in the first place is very, very good start. Oh, okay. Here we go. All right. So one example, let's take that as the main spot. Obviously, like you find lots of those low boards where you have all the gut shots where you have like, this is important that you have like some air you can dunk as well and then bluff later. If you don't have any, if you always have a peer it plays a little differently. But this is a typical low board spot where villains should bet big, important to big bet. All right, so now let's say this is just the extreme example of having a defined range, advantage because of the turn card, and that's it pretty much. And now the optional spot is just where everything is the same way, just a little weaker. So we call a bet on the flop, not necessarily a pot bet or an overbet, let's say Willem bets half pot or three quarters, and we see let's say not the gin card but like a favorable turn card. It's good for us. And now that point that is very important to cover our second goal, The first two points are here or like the second point especially is that we have the goal of growing pot. We have some kind of advantage. The third bullet point here is for we have also incentive to deny some equity. Villain's air, the hands that are potentially or hopefully folding now, has equity versus our weakest hands. Either we win air versus air or our low showdown value needs protection like a random bottom pair. And this is why donking probably on something like a queen 5-4 turn some card is still better than something like on a queen 10-8. Our bottom pair probably just needs way less protection, equity denial. And on like ace king something you won't find any donks even though there is like a big bets going on on the flop, right? Let's take one of our favorite boards from from other coachings ace king four where we've all learned that we check or overbet the flop if we don't want to have like another cool fancy simplification. So let's have a quick look for those who did not attempt that coaching the ace-king-four. We go big or go home. That's the plan. And we can quickly look on the turn reports. Obviously, the king should be the best card, maybe. Who knows? Because against the overbet, we fold quite some king-ex already. And I hope there's not that much dunking there's some four percent like global dunking on a king it's kind of yes king of clubs being best because then we have all the king x with the backdoor flush draws then we always continue so we hit we hit more trips on the king of clubs than on the others but that's about about it. Yeah, Willem did overbet, so Melespin is a little confused. Wow, donk on the king. Yes, we sometimes run into boats, but Willem mainly has ace queen, ace jack, ace ten, and does not overbet with the king. So the overbet just means he does not have a naked king, and this is what we can make use of. But here we also see the other part is missing, the donk. What do we accomplish with our king donk if we have it here? Billion's reaction, he's folding hands that have freaking 0% equity. Is that really our goal? Maybe it's better to donk even smaller here. Just don't allow him to check back. I don't know. Put out a min donk. Running it with very big size, you mean? I think you keep that for the river. I just don't see... Maybe a little more to make queen-jack, queen-10, jack-10 indifferent. That might be drawing dead. If we have king-10, king-jack and their their gut shot is is dead maybe a little more than those 20 25 here is a big size an option but it's not on that card sorry but the big size is not getting taken you you're not aiming directional and villain is too covered for that so you're not doing that that on the turn. You donk small and then like think about the race course. Which pot size do you aim for? If this goes all in I see myself running into pocket fours, king four suited and ace king just all day long. Ace king is 100% overbet, that's a lot of combinations. So let's have a look after donking the the turn seeing that river brick um what's the size that the big blind chooses probably like pot slightly over pot 150 percent is the king size here all right so it's like tiny and then the overbet this is like where you want to end up with yeah getting in 50 big blinds each that's kind of your where your advantage is with a naked king and once you get the jam in your face you absolutely hate your life because villain is protected and we know this is quite some combinations okay so just the example this is why high on high cards this is just way less interesting think about the equity denial like we don't have many 4x that are interested in folding out something like 6- seven. We just don't care. Okay. So yeah, I'll just want to mention that just a little weaker. It can be like a queen five, four turn five. This can be like a queen six, five turn seven turn four big blend where some of the lots of options. But since we don't have too much time and I still want to show you some examples, we can categorize that then a little later where, yeah, whether that is kind of an optimal spot or an optional spot. This is what I want you to, where I want you to see it. Just like the optimal spot, I want you to absolutely understand the optional spots. It's like just the same things, a little weaker, and we can mess around with dongs, but it's not necessary from like a theory standpoint a theory standpoint and right then the second point was here that we've seen beautifully is what about the turn sizing you always need to think about what you're aiming at right here at subi had the idea to attack the ace right on the turn with the with the over bet just like we're betting bigger with the king and make that indifferent here's the problem that villain was just too protected that we can invest that much money so we rather go small and then donk where the small donk does not have small doesn't have a real effect so it was indifferent to the check and then we freaking donk or overbet the river with the 150 it's kind of the same thing it's like there's no accomplishment in folding out villains super trash that anyways checks back and can't improve to anything on the river. Okay, cool. Let's see what's next. Some examples. We have the 9-5-2's rainbow and I like that game. Let's use the example for a little bit of the optional spots and we take the king-jack-4 next and I just ask you again, I want to hear three cards. Let's stick to button versus big blind. You face a big bet on KJ4 with a flush draw. You see the exact board here and I want you to guess which cards are the highest frequency donking cards. Guarding donk size, is it necessary to increase it to 25 to 33 in practice at the level of 50 zoom? Anything between 15 and 35 will be fine, I'm pretty sure. Even some min donks can be cool. I want you to know what you're attacking and you want to hurt that hand. Usually it's like the 9-5 music sample, you want to hurt the Jack-10 that sits there and hopefully snap-falls. That's probably the best if people just don't think about it. All right, Subi with the first answer. We got the Jack, we got the four, perhaps ace in hearts. You mean ace in spades, right? So for the flushes. Jack, four ace of spades. That's interesting, right? The flushes, the ace of spades is better for us because then Willem doesn't have the nut flushes that he has more, but all the low flushes are interesting. But on the other hand, he improves to lots of two pairs and obviously the straight and so on. So it's tough. So flush is interesting. Draws getting there after calling a big bet. And obviously the middle card card peering that villain is not really covering with the big bets let's double check on that i'm absolutely with you maybe even a card that brings the straight also right that like a flush plus straight card that we always call probably we don't want ace queen to get there but like maybe a queen nine or something like that. So first of all I want to confirm those diamonds right doesn't matter but just to keep it consistent that a big bet exists on that board obviously it doesn't make sense to discuss something where the big bet is not a thing. Kj4 is the offsuit broad offsuit gut shots for villain flush draws middle peers so it makes sense to attack that. We see we can combine that overbet or this or pot bet, whatever, like a 25% plus big bet. For the sake of the example, I'll click on the overbet. That makes it a little nicer for the turn to understand things. And obviously the deuce of diamonds will not be a great dunking card, but report's turn. I'll wait a second. Here we go. Actually. be a great donking card but report's turn. Wait a second. Here we go. Actually king is pretty cool. Just think about well against a big bet. Lillian is not overbetting with like king 9, king 10 but we have all the king x. We're not folding really a king even if it's an overbet. The jack, hello, here we go, right? Even the nine, just the queen 10, we have always, on the other hand, we have like 100% in the continuing range. Maybe sometimes we check raise, but not too much against an overbet. And the nine of spades is very interesting, right? Nine of spades. Eight of spades maybe includes that, what, I don't know,, I said before, we improve to like more equity on the turn. Let's say we have something like a 9-10. Super interesting on an 8 of spades to then start dunking, especially with a 10-9 with a 10 of spades. You just can't check call. You need to find an option, right? 7 of spades. We see the spades are interesting and also the pairing cards and also slightly the main draw getting there. Let it be the flush also or not. It's kind of optional. Mandatory on the jack, that's just a thing, right? Kind of the dream spot. Mid card appears after overbetting that we have quite a lot. I think it's a little important that the jack of spades is available because other jack eggs we are folding. So we have every jack of spades and Willem never has that. That makes a lot of trips on those jack eggs. But yeah, and let's compare the ace of spades. It's not a special one, but what we see is that some bigger donks make sense then, because that we rather polarize to the flushes because this is where our advantage is. I mean, it's still almost nothing, but see some, maybe some 10, 20% big donk on that ace of spades, right? Taking our six, three of spades, putting a little pressure on, right? Willem just improved to lots of us. What do we make in difference? His ace, X probably, right? He sits here on like lots of improved ace, six, ace, five, on and hates his life which is good okay villain hating hey villains hating their lives this is awesome so really understanding okay he said he has something good on that board we catch them on the turn with the jack or with the king or with the flush or with and so on right so lots of options and they make sense whether you build a beautiful range or not now now or not doesn't matter really right no one will find out and if you only want to dunk something like what did we say like here 10-9 offsuit but we don't have the 10-9 offsuit here where was it queen queen nine we have queen nine the queen nine with the spade like you see those hands that are really interested in it like a clear clear dunk that would need to check fold probably and it's very very nice okay cool One more interesting one. Just waiting. There's some guys typing. There's one more question. If not, you can already think about the Puck, not the Puck, the trips five on the board. So button versus big blind, we see a board of five, five, five. Button is range betting with actually not a tiny size, but like a medium size. Let's say half pot. Which cards do we see most donking? Thank you. not a tiny size but like a medium size, let's say half pot, which cards do we see most donking? I want to hear three cards again. Three cards, donking after a check calling on 5-5-5. No one has ever done that but it is a thing. Lots of equity to be denied there. Ace, king, five. Ace, king, queen. So we go for the high cards, right? Obviously, this overbet won't be really a thing. That doesn't make sense. Bigger half pot, let's say range bet half pot. We call, again think about we need to improve relatively. We want to improve, we want Willem not to improve. What are we having? We have all the ace highs, a lot of the king highs, and then that's it. Some peers, some five X that we mix and so on, obviously. That's it. So ace and king sounds freaking sexy if donking does happen. Let's double check on an ace. Hello. Who did put out this 20% bet the last time he was in that spot? Probably no one was in that spot ever because flopping grips here like that is tough. But it makes a hell lot of sense. All right and then 20%. Hello Jack-10 what are you doing? It's just so like please continue your freaking King-8 or Jack-8 like I don't care right or just fold everything I don't care either so very very nice let's let's have a quick look at the reports I think you guys nailed it with the ace. The queen probably not but the ace king. Ace always, king often, five also. All right five makes ace just turn like turn nuts so the five is actually even more important. A PRH5, ah then it's probably more about the trips but I'll do it. Let's do the 552s, the other card is more irrelevant. And then we get an ace, 552s. 552s is probably not much half potting though. And then ranges are a little wider. So let's have a look. Half potting is a thing, not that much. So ranges are wider, out of position needs to defend wider, therefore has more shit. That leads to less of an equity shift on an ace turn and to less donking. That would be my explanation here. And then there's nothing. That's so important here. It's really that big size. If someone... Let's have a look at that strategy here. The big size means a little something. It's like tens, nines, eights, little, little, little stronger and then it hits the ace less. This is why we see more. It's really always the combination. It's not just the card. It's what the villain represents. He represents with the bigger bet, maybe his pocket sevens for max protection. And then the ace hurts him a little more than when he bets small. He wants to value bet every ace-axe, he hits that himself all the time and so on. Right, Subi. In tournaments I feel like with shorter stack size and a lot more range betting the flush computer, the flush completer, here we go, are not not gto donks off any thoughts on that is it because the big money playing range is so much wider on the flop absolutely it starts pre-flop pre-flop the range is much wider and much weaker because of the ante in the middle this allows the aggressor to see that way smaller and higher frequency because of his advantage. And therefore, the ranges stay way wider overall and just flushes are more rare, right? The big blind has lots of offsuit hands also. So this is the first or second point of one of the slides that we need defined ranges. Defined ranges, really that we know what villains are having, what we are having, that it's not just like super wide versus super wide and yes we have five combos more flushes but no one cares because we have all the queen five offsuits. That's kind of a very, very, very important point. All right let's get to last example the ace jack five three bet pot blind versus blind. So I tell you that betting half pot there is a thing on the flop, right? So we will c-bet half pot, ace of hearts, jack of hearts, five of clubs, and we are again looking for three turn cards where we do donking on. Oh sorry, I need to fold. Small blind is two. Small blind, raise 10, call, ace, jack, five, check. So MadMath says the same goes for 5-5-5 when big blind regems a lot of ace-axes and I can't see donking on ace being any good. Absolutely. If you play 20 big blinds, this is all shit, right? right this is all cash game 100 big line examples wider ranges with with tournaments it will change a lot it's way more about the peers than the draws because all those bullshit offsuit hands make a lot of peers but they don't make lots of straights and flushes um to say in very very general words and when we think about nut advantage for 40 big lines or whatever you guys are playing with like those kindergarten games it's like some trips are just very nutted as we've seen for like the ace king for a king example right maybe there is there's lots of bumping maybe in a tournament after betting big like in a tournament will be just a range bet and everyone is betting every king also. But that's kind of it. That it's just kind of a different game and we need to understand. And this is why I try to talk as much as possible about the goals of our bet. Why? Where is the actual advantage? It's not, oh, but Stefan said on like a turn ace on that, this is where we don't know. It's like my range improves a lot because he doesn't have that a lot i always have that this is why we're super strong now and i want to achieve this and that by betting with those bluffs and those value hands or range or whatever you're into more all right i'm loving it yeah trophies yeah i i just looked up to the few trophies i'm having but it's not enough just not enough by the way trophies congrats to our very own let's call it Roland Rokita who just took down a bracelet yesterday the the hybrid online live if you if you didn't didn't read the news already we got a we got a very own poker code a grindhouse one member bracelet from from Vegas yesterday so uh shout out to him right here from those kindergarten games all right even better kindergarten game right just play click a little online sit down on the final table for life to enjoy the show just take it down and yeah i have a little shiny bling bling bracelet all right let's yeah i i gotta rush a little to the end uh here's some's it called? Children's noises here. So it's like, someone came just home and is waiting for, for daddy to finish work, but, not before we double check a little on the ace, Jack five. So I told you there's definitely like some half pot betting or even bigger bets. So let's take the bigger bet even, right? Some big betting that makes sense on that board, right? We are not just in equity. It's not really range bet. We see like our advantage as the aggressor as the three better is like having ace king ace queen a lot right the other stuff here is like not that interesting we don't need to bet like kings queens and that stuff so let's take the big bet now we are talking about very defined ranges we We have a three bet pot, we have a big bet, the little represents ace-king, ace-queen, ace-jack mainly, and doesn't have much ace-jack though, and we call. We call when we have an ace, we call when we have a jack partly, and we call when we have a flush draw, and we call when we have king- queen with backdoor. Or a king-ten. What are the best donking cards? We have Nevermore's answer already in there. Jack, any heart, and maybe a ten. Sounds very, very reasonable, I would say, actually, after looking at that. Maybe anyone thought about an ace. Doesn't change our thing against ace-king, ace-queen, but makes but makes it more likely if we have an ace that the villain is full of shit. Let's have a look. So this is that evaluation that I want you to think through when playing in-game, right? What would make sense? And then on the ace I would say, like, what do we try to achieve? Like with ace seven folding out some shit? I would say, like, probably not too much dunking, maybe super tiny tiny dunking if it is a thing, who knows. So let's have a look. flush draw and straight draw complete cards. So we see hearts a little, deuce three, four, six, seven, not that necessary because the pot is that big that we just can still rip it in. 75 big blinds into a 50 big blind pot. So we don't need to blast the pot now. A 10 is super interesting. Gives us lots of extra equity and some nuts that Villain almost doesn't have. Villain does not have much king-queen offsuit in his three betting range and then betting big. And obviously the jack is not too bad. Ace, I think, is not a bad card for us, us but no reason to dump so actually we see a zero here. All right that was the few examples I prepared myself. Now let's quickly go the extra 10 minutes that won't hurt. Some explosive thoughts. So now as always in those spots deeper in the game tree I want you to really read, I will read it out loud, the first bullet point and think about what that means. What did villain do wrong and what will he do wrong? Because this is two very very different things. So we are in a spot where already stuff happened and we have the chance that villain already messed up and we can now take advantage of that or we give villain kind of a task and he is shit and will do something wrong then it would be great if we know what he is doing wrong now this comes back to i sorry i forget the names with all the chats but i love it that that i get so much chat activity today so said like, but wouldn't you if someone is blasting just donk your strong hands small? Yes, exactly. This is the second point. What is he doing wrong? He blasts versus donks because he reads weakness into it? Yeah, turn things around, right? Do it with the nuts. But now we have the other point. What did villain do wrong? For example, villain did c-bet all his high cards on a low board. Okay, we made use of that by check-raising a lot already, but now we can again take even more advantage of that if we see the next low card. He doesn't hit that shit. He sits on all high card bullshit. We can do more donking than we are supposed to in theory because his range is shit. He already messed up. And this is what I want you to look out for the most because this is something the villain cannot repair. If he already messed up, whatever he does now, he cannot start bluff catching with jack-10-high. It just does not work, right? So he messed up already. So he can't make a decision, right? It's like if you're on the river, if you're bluff heavy or not against someone who sits on bluff catcher you don't know will he make the right decision this time or next time or in general we don't know right like but if we know how people play and they did something wrong before already yeah that's like already that's what my mom would say so yeah so you had to understand under under race and turn versus exactly maybe you can dunk if you know someone is checking back trying to strike too strong if he's not value betting thinly and you have it yes so this is always in my head what did he say was villain's wrong decision if they oversee but too many weak hands on the flop on boards where they don't have an advantage let's say say under the gun on 3-5-6, just range bets. He has King-Jack offsuit, King-Queen offsuit, Queen-Jack offsuit, Ace-Jack offsuit, Ace-10 offsuit. And it's only covered by those over pairs that are over time not that nutted on like 6-5-3, right? We give me a 3, a 4, a deuce, a 5, a 6, a 7, an 8, a 9, like he will have trouble. So this is something now where I think about we can freestyle quite a lot. Or let's say something very easy, queen 7, 4, someone bets big on a board where big betting is not really a thing. What do they have? They have kings or ace queen. It's that easy. Some people just always have those hands, nothing else. Well, if the board gets scary and you know they check back at some point, just take over the initiative if you have better, or you can bluff them off. It's like, why not? Like, build the pot, right? It's like this year, our race course. This is the pot on the flop. This is the all-in pot, right? You know what they are doing. They start. Usually, it usually it's again the big bets on the flop. And if the turn gets ugly, they bet one more time and then they stop here. But if your goal is to build a pot in that direction, or you know they are folding if you build a pot into that direction, then you can take at any point. But check raising is expensive here. A check raise against a big bet is tough can't cannot really choose you can check all that flop that turn gets ugly you start doing this if he raises you can go over the top probably they are mainly calling and then you still have like that like this is a little long right but like you still have that 200 river pot option or 250 or whatever we had before i just like it open. If things are going in your favor, you're taking over, you're setting the racetrack to whatever pot size you want. And this is the way I talk. This can be bluff and value. Yeah. Donk has a confirmation. We have the nuts. We tell a story. Well, we have it. We can tell the story of the hand we have also, or the hand we are drawing to in a spot where we have the advantage. So always value and bluff. We are not playing rock, paper, scissors here. We're just saying, thank you for telling us your hand if people are face up. Could maybe even dunk when it's not allowed, but you have hand that wants to realize equity, set your price and know that villain won't attack the dunk enough. It's exactly like, let's say something like king, seven, five rainbow. Villain bets big, turn is the queen with a flush draw. He bets big again. I know he has ace, king or aces, like kind of like that's exaggerate, but lots of players it is like that. River is the river is the and the flush gets in i know he's not value betting aces or ace king anymore if i have any hand better than that i can choose a sizing i can sneak out like this is a river dunk but it's kind of the same thought i want to build a little more i don't want to face a jam if i don't have a flush or like a big bet no if he's betting i'm block catching with any two pair or something like that. We can block bet 20%. They are not laying down their aces or their ace king. You can build the pot to the size if you can cover that. If your range can cover that or you know that villain just does not have it. That villain never has a flush here, for example, because he's betting big only when he has it. I have very often very often that note bet size means hand strength all right so obviously villain should if he implements a big betting range should have some ace four suited with backdoor in there then we have a problem but lots of people look at their hand they have ace king this is why they bet big let's make it even flushy let's make it a flush draw on the turn all right then it's rainbow on the turn the flush draw on the flop rainbow on on the turn, and now the flush gets there. That's even more typical. So it's very, very freestyle. So I want you to understand why and when it makes sense, and from that on we can play crazy. So this here, really for me, important is that understanding. What did Willem do wrong? If he already did something wrong, that's perfect. We definitely exploit here. If we think he does something wrong in the future, we can also be wrong. Then it's a bet of us being right in the rock-paper-scissor game. And we should win that bet more often than not. All right, second point, very important. Whole rights seed betting strategies are best victims. This is where people tell you their hand. It's not a range anymore. Very often people forget bluffs, they have very clear hands, they look at their hand, this is why they do this and that. Another exploitative thought is that we mentioned that a lot, that people are a little scared going for thin value or bluffing, something like that. So they play more honest in let's say weird lines, like weird, the turn donk is not weird if if implemented correctly But lots of people are not playing it. Lots of people don't see it often. So it's it's an option. It's an option All right, so to just say like okay, they stay a little handcuffed. They don't do a shit you can you can just do what you want and This is the goal really if you know their hand and there are lots of players tell you their hand early, punish them. Punish face up and unprotected ranges. If you know they don't have that mid-peer, it peers on the turn, we are all in on the river in a certain way, right? With bluffs and when we have it. His mistake was to never bet mid-peer big on the flop. What will he do wrong? I don't know whether he catches me or not. If we know that we can go for max exploit and bet small when we have it and and jam if if he falls if we know he falls but if we don't have it but this is too tough for me. Okay key takeaways pretty much the same thing again look for hands that add a lot of new nut hands to your range. Not hands, really. Look for turn cards. This is a typo, thought typo. Look for turn cards that add a lot of new nut hands to your range. Don't just take your hand and I want to achieve something with my straight draw and so on. No, you need this turn card against somewhat reasonable opponents. Tight ranges allow more donking. So tight ranges, it's more clear which cards help which player. So on average, it helps you a little more often. Donk bets are usually small. You wait for later streets. Like river donks can be big, but on the turn you prepare something, you play your range, and then you can still get this 300% hammer on the river if ranges are correct like that. And for messing up prevention, if you're unsure and you don't realize the spot, a check is never wrong. I don't want you to go out here and just donk the shit out of it now. It's more like once per session or something. Maybe it comes up. Maybe not. It's not a very, very frequent thing, but it's something that we can mess up a lot. So if you are unsure, you can just check. That's also fine. And this is important to say here also. All right. I'll give you three, five more minutes because I asked him and I need to show some high stakes hands now. Let me see. I want to share them. But this was it from the coaching side. And now we just show, I don't know. I didn't read through them, but it's probably some big pots that are fun. Maybe it's a little shit versus fish, or maybe it's some wreck war. We'll find out. Let's see. Beautiful. All right. what we got here? This seems like an NL20K on GG. I'll just guide you through the hand quickly, right? And maybe give it a short evaluation. Oh, someone started. It starts with an MP limp. Hero raises, cutoff. That should be limp race. What the fuck is going on? No cutoff versus button. Limp. I think we skipped this one. Check, call. This guy donks the turn, calls that race, and check, calls that all in, and he has deuce three suited. This is, I think, actually what we are not really looking for, but this is a nice little $38,000 pot. I'm just browsing. I have like six, seven hand histories here. Maybe there's one that makes sense. Ah, this is a very typical one. Another super fish. So my buddy filtered here for donks. So actually you see it's more the recreations that do donks where they don't make sense. All right. So we have early position versus cutoff action. Early position, the recreational open raises. He must be too loose and is a little splashy because King Jack offsuit from the cutoff action. Early position, the recreational open raises. He must be too loose and is a little splashy because King Jack offsuit from the cutoff is not a three bet. But that will be correct here if he does that. Recreational calls. And we, let's say we, we are hero here. And c-bet small on queen 10-6. I guess he's just range betting against the recreational here. This guy calls. And now we see a third pot dunk of the recreational on that board on the term king and now i want to know your combined i call population tendency reads all right so what do you think does that third pot don't mean? Merge, Dren, and Bet. Nevermore, PR plus Open Ender. Got straight. queen, jack, jack, 10, shit. Right. Mm-hmm, monkey. Nice. All right. So we see already, oh, you see the river already that helps a little, that he checks there and then check calls a big bet. So you guys are obviously right, right? The small donk not showing strength. It's the very, very typical, I set the price myself. I want to see one more card, but I'm weak. It's like a very, very typical thing. Like compared to that from a recreational pot donk would be a different story. That would be like the jack nine or the king 10 or something like that. And you are all correct. We see the queen jack here for a nice little 20k pot here the queen jack offsuit that's a very very typical thing if you've played enough with like typical recreationals maybe you i find one one more nice one uh it's so much that is happening okay this year is super interested actually I want to run that in a second. This year. All right, so hero. We have big line versus small blind and call a 3x open race. We stab half pot with our top two pair and villain check calls. Turn is an ace and villain starts donking. does that make sense? If I look that up, do you guys think this donk exists? You can just type in one for yes and two for no. No, no. Is it like, I mean, the aggressor check calls every ace king, ace queen, ace jack. So nevermore is here for the one. Actually, I'm a little unsure. I think it might exist. See, I type it in on the second smaller side. Okay, 33 just is for me smaller size. That's okay. If it's 20 or 25 in the solver, I'm fine with that. So let's not be too nitpicky here. 873 and I'll show you in a second. 873 turn will be the ace of clubs. So check. Yes, check. Oh, you don't know the hand yet. I know it already. I wanted to say, but I actually didn't. I think Doody goes for like, this is a mix of all sides. I think he bets half pot only. Does that with top two. The villain check calls. And ace of clubs on the turn. See some leading. So it's not out of the 20%. Obviously the bigger size will lead to lower frequency. ace eight a seven is high frequency in villains range so yeah probably it's not out of the 20%. Obviously, the bigger size will lead to lower frequency. Ace-8, ace-7 is high frequency in Willem's range. So yeah, probably it's not there too often. Let's see, are there any other cards after check calling? Out of the seven, obviously this one, but not really. So that 8-7, probably the positional advantage is very huge here. So you want to keep the pot a little smaller out of position. Okay, let's continue the turn big villain calls check and duty goes for the sneaky i put you an ace king ace queen ace nine ace ten and goes for the 150 overbet jam and yeah have fun you can guess the hand he calls you guys can guess the hand it's not ace jack and that's the last thing coaching is over after that one ace king i think i'll help you a little the hand is an absolute it's a zero percent play on the flop it's a zero percent play on the turn after the donk i think not 100 sure but i would think so if like obviously the donk is not a thing but yeah and then the river I think is fine miss flush draw okay now we got the freaking pocket threes so it's 100% check raise on the flop after checking then I think donking getting the raise in pocket threes is the first hand that just wants to get the money in against the ace eight a7 before there are any straight on flush cards yeah I think Dooley had lots of chances to get away from that, but not, not like that. All right. Thanks everyone who was here. I hope you enjoyed it. Leave me any comments in discord. We're in touch here and I would love to read some hand histories regarding dunking, maybe some fun ones, maybe some, some GTO style ones and see you next month.
