### TOPIC: 3 reasons youâre stuck at low stakes in poker
hello my name is Don coron and today I'm going 
to show you the three reasons why you're stuck  
at small [Music] stakes poker is chaos tell me 
if you find this familiar you start playing poker  
you're grinding the micro Stakes the small stakes 
and at some point you decide that you want to  
take your strategy to the next level you want to 
actually find how to play properly you get online  
you start looking for videos for content and what 
you see is NeverEnding amounts of information so  
many topics so many different approaches and so 
many different people telling you to do so many  
different things in fact a lot of coaches or a 
lot of strong players seem to disagree use the  
HUD more use the HUD less study with the solver 
more study with the solver less if you have a  
friend who plays higher Stakes than you and you 
send him a hand or you post a hand on a forum  
you get a lot of answers like it depends I 
don't know we need more information there's  
also seemingly infinite topics for flush forb 
pots blockers on the river the sizing geometric  
super geometric there's just so many things to 
learn out there and at the end of the day you  
feel lost you don't know what direction to take 
well hopefully in this video I can show you the  
general direction you need to move towards one of 
the main mistakes that you're probably making is  
focusing too much on small edges now this might 
be a little bit of a controversial topic because  
it is a common talking point that poker is a 
game of small edges and to some extent that's  
true that is great advice for someone who's 
not putting enough attention to detail but if  
you're watching GTO wizard videos and you using a 
solver regularly this is probably not your problem  
in fact you might be making the opposite 
mistake which is paying too much attention  
to details that are not yet your priority like for 
example being too specific about blockers being  
too specific about sizings pre flop on the Flop or 
trying to achieve some kind of perfect balance and  
being an exploitable in reality poker is a game 
of big edges there is an elephant in the room  
your opponents are making such blatant mistakes 
especially at the micro stakes and small stakes  
and you need to find what those mistakes are and 
take advantage of them let's look for example at  
this spot this is a b check bat situation in a 
single race pot button versus big blind if we  
filter for the Bluffs we will see certain things 
like 108 of Hearts being a less preferred Bluff  
than the other suits whereas for Jack 10 Jack 10 
of Hearts is very preferred for bluffing while  
Jack 10 of clubes isn't and it would look at 85 
it seems like the Spades are the least preferred  
Bluffs now I'm sure there is a valid reason for 
these blocker choices by the solver but I will  
confess to you I don't know what it is I don't 
care and I'm not going to put any effort into  
finding out why because there is a much bigger 
Edge to be had in this spot especially at low  
stakes this is a commonly overfolded line if we go 
to the big blind strategy and we nolock a slight
overfolded to checking this is why poker 
especially at micros and small Stakes is a  
game of big edges so what should be our approach 
first of all you need to prioritize spots there  
is a great spreadsheet that tombos made in which 
you input your GT Wizard score for each position  
and it multiplies it by the frequency of that 
spot and the size of the pot in that spot and  
that gives you your priority number for that 
particular situation you need to review your  
own database you need to learn to interpret 
your own stats if you're playing low stakes  
you certainly have very big leaks and if you can 
find what those are are and find solutions to them  
your strategy will become much more solid exploit 
obvious Tendencies there is a lot of low hanging  
fruit at lower stakes and even at higher Stakes 
don't get caught on all of the small details and  
make sure you're noticing the elephant in the room 
focus on practical takeaways when you're studying  
you should try to come up with a generalized 
conclusion from what you looked at you need  
to be able to apply what you learn to different 
situations you can't be waiting for the same exact  
situation to repeat another mistake that we're 
going to look at is quality over quantity and  
again this is another controversial topic because 
it would seem intuitive that quality is better  
than quantity to some extent this is true it's 
good to have every once in a while one of these  
sessions where you go overhand with your mates and 
you spend one or two hours reviewing just at hand  
but the problem is that you have a lot of leaks 
that range from Big pots and big decisions to a  
lot of small mundane decisions that happen very 
often you are probably overthinking about the  
unknowable there's a lot of big decisions where 
maybe you have a top pair and you're facing a  
triple barrel in a three pot and you're trying to 
find reasons to possibly get away somehow this is  
very difficult and this is what I would call a 
small Edge you're probably focusing too much on  
big pots a lot of mistakes that people are making 
happen pre flop in small pots on the Flop remember  
small pot doesn't equal small Edge people are 
playing a lot of tables they're playing a lot  
of volume and there's certainly big edges to 
be had in all of these spots so let's go back  
to this situation where we are Bon vers big bline 
sing race spot but now we're going to look at what  
happens when we Face a quarter pop bet what do you 
think is the weakest defend against this bet and  
notice I said defend and not call so I'm counting 
Bluff raises value raises calls everything do  
you think it's bottom pair three in this case you 
think it's eight High you think it's eight [Music]
high if we look at it we see that the weakest 
defend is eight high for some people this is  
the first time that they've seen this because 
they've actually never opened a Sim in this  
specific situation they've opened Sims for a 
triple barrel in a four pot a triple barrel  
in a three pot at 250% all in on the river in 
a single race pot but they've never looked at  
what happens when they see bet the Flop and they 
check back the turn and they face a bet for some  
people it might even be surprising the fact that 
you're calling hands like ace8 here almost pure  
and that you're calling hands like Ace Jack 
and ace10 at a very high frequency so what  
should we do you need to develop a broadly decent 
strategy instead of a sometimes great but mostly  
bad strategy you need to review lots of hands 
my personal recommendation is that you export  
your hands that reach the Flop each session 
and you upload them to GTO wiard GTO wizard  
will give you a GTO score and an Eevee loss and 
then you can use these numbers to sort the Hands  
by the spots in which you are actually making 
the biggest mistakes instead of the spots that  
you care about the most another recommendation 
is that you drill many different spots in a GTO  
trainer the last point we're going to make and 
certainly not the least important in fact maybe  
the most important is a generally bad approach 
for example being complacent in order to get good  
at poker you need to have passion for improving 
your strategy constantly rationalizing emotional  
play a lot of players especially at lower Stakes 
are very prone to saying things like I know that  
the server told me to Bluff here I know that my 
coach told me that bluffing here works really  
well but I'm not going to do it because in my 
pool my opponents call me always in reality  
what's probably happening is that whenever you 
do get called you feel feel really bad but the  
bluff works just fine try to understand your 
own emotions and practice self-awareness being  
too results oriented look at the end of the day 
we want to make money we care about results but  
sometimes the variance in this game is huge and 
we need to turn down the volume and keep grinding  
waiting for someone to tell you what to do no one 
is going to put in the work for you you need to be  
proactive find what your leaks are are find what 
your problems are and fix them so to summarize  
look for practical takeaways when studying try 
to generalize your conclusions in order to use  
them in new spots and not just the spot that you 
looked at focus on the elephant in the room if you  
stuck at small Stakes the reason is going to be 
a big one not a small Min detail study quantity  
not just quality and depth it's good to have one 
of those long onand review sessions but you also  
need to look at a lot of small pots be proactive 
find what your leaks are and fix them that's all  
for this video I hope you liked it I hope you 
learned something and see you in the next one
