### TOPIC: 5 biggest leaks people are making compared to gto
i thought i would do
something a bit more general and
something that probably all viewers are
going to be able to
take something from i hope at least
and the idea today will be to discuss
in my view at least in my opinion what
are the five biggest leaks or five
biggest deviations that i see
people making compared to gto okay so
if you're here it means that you study
focus seriously maybe you are already a
professional
maybe you're trying to become a
professional and here at gta wizard
obviously we have this amazing platform
that helps us study gto
but obviously gto is hard right it's not
something that is
easy enough that you can just browse
some sims and learn everything
that's why we also thought that having
this time here the weekly coaches would
be beneficial for you guys things you
could
maybe wake up to maybe you haven't paid
attention to this
and some things that could be could
already be a leak for your game
okay so the idea is going to be to be
very practical very straight to the
point
and show you guys some things that i
believe you could be doing better
and things that are of course that are
hard at gto land uh but should be our
job to try and become better and try and
do better
all right
all right some guys muted themselves
okay we have some other people joining
we have 35 people at this moment
and so we can begin
so i'll be trying to interact with you
guys through the chat if you want to
unmute yourself
and ask a question that is no problem
okay
i know that sometimes uh it can be a
little bit intimidating
to talk but if you are ready for it if
you're up to it i think it can be even
more
interesting in terms of interaction to
have you guys talking instead of just
typing
but feel free to do whatever you like i
would just
ask that you don't speak at the same
time
someone else is speaking okay but feel
free to unmute yourself
and talk to me at any given point okay
so i'll start by asking you guys uh
what are you what do you guys think is
maybe one or two leaks you think that is
present in most people's games uh
that you would like to to to maybe
discuss a little bit or
in your vision what do you think is a
common leak that people have
compared to gto what is something that
solvers do
that humans struggle to do a lot of the
time
let's see if anyone has some ideas and
if those ideas
match with what i have in mind for today
you guys can type you guys can kind of
mute and talk
uh what what do you guys think are
common leaks that population has or
poker players professionals have
compared to gto
funky monkey said not enough aggression
is a huge one
in my opinion when you say aggression
are you talk because aggression can be a
lot of things right it can be
frequency of bats it can be thin value
bets
you can be raises right it can be bad
sizing maybe people use lower bet sizes
than solver does
aggression is a little bit too big i
think but it's
it's a good point and i think it's a
correct one
charlie said not check crazy enough
single race part and three bet
not raising line versus blind enough
cool
so not play aggressive enough when
facing a bet
right so the ability to raise and check
raise versus that
cool very good then set overfolding
absolutely we're going to we're going to
discuss that today
sosan 91 said under check raids versus
tiny bets
so another similar one to to charlie the
ability to raise your small bags
benjamin the data set value betting what
exactly in terms of value betting
benjamin
do you think it's like hand selection
people often check because if you shoot
that
or you think it's related to bet sizing
funky monkey said taking advantage of
your initiative
raising overbatting okay cool
israel rodriguez said over folding turn
hands
gob said not three betting pre enough
from the big blind
very good one very good one we're not
gonna get into this one today
but it's certainly a a real one
dog z said playing wide ranges in late
positions
i think this is is more going to be
a thing for recreational players i think
regulars don't make that mistake too
often i'm playing
two widely positions but certainly
recreation was played way
way way too wide raphael said
not calling enough and not bluffing
enough in general
okay jackkoff said be unbalanced not
bluff
enough luciano said one very interesting
don't protect or range okay
and myogen doesn't check all
and call enough with the top range
okay so maybe something like slow
playing the top of the range sometimes
right is what you mean
i think i would have to agree with with
you on that one
as well so we can see that you guys have
a lot of things on your mind already
that at least you sense that
you have a trouble doing this sometimes
yourself or maybe you perceive this on
other players
but pretty much everything that you guys
said makes a lot of sense
and most of these are real leaks i'm
going to go through some that i've
listed here
and i'm going to use hand examples to
show you guys what i mean
obviously this is not an extensive list
i'm not going to be able to list every
single lead that i think people have
when it comes to applying gto strategies
but i think
at the top of my head those are the most
significant ones that
you could also be having a trouble
yourself and i think you should
implement into your game okay so the
first one and i have
some notes here in my second monitor
that you won't be able to see but it's
fine
maybe in a later moment i can put the
notes
as well
let me get it ready here
here i put the notes on the right and
i'm gonna put the chat
on the left all right
so the first one that i think is really
really important i feel like
even even highest even some high-stakes
players can have this leak
okay which is the lack of depolarized
strategies in your game okay so
one thing that i see a lot with my
students
and even when i study high stakes
players
so a common common study for for
for someone playing high stakes is to
study the other great players
and what i see a lot of times is that
there are a lot of nodes where people
lack depolarized strategies
and i'm going to explain what i mean by
this by using this example here
of a three bad pot out of position so in
this hand
we have a three by part of position
small blind versus button so the button
opens 2.5 x
with three bet the usual 11 big blinds
with around 15
enhance i'm not going to go into the
pre-flop ranges but if you guys want to
take a look at that
just let me know and
then we get this ace 10 4 board
in here most people do what also the
software does
which is blocked bad very frequently you
see the solver using here some bigger
bats as well
a lot of players are just going to
simplify to using one sizing on the flop
and i think that's totally fine you're
not going to lose much
at all by removing one of the sizes that
is
not used too much and then they block
that the flop
and then they get to a random turn and i
i selected the specific
eight of hearts turn here and
what we see from the solver is a very
depolarized
batting strategy you see that the solver
continues to back very frequently
around seventy percent of the time and
the most frequently used sizing is this
blocked bed here it also uses a lot of
the half box sizing
and i believe if we allowed it to use a
three-quarter sizing
it would use it sometimes as well but we
see that it really wants to place
another tiny bat with many parts of the
range
so you're going to see stuff like 10x
betting super often for a tiny bed
pocket jacks that is super often almost
never check
pocket queens pocket kings and then
pocket aces also betting with the small
size
very often a lot of people even people
like 500s and rags and even some some
high-stakes rags
are going to play a very polarized
strategy on this note they're just going
to
check the middling hands and then bat
recorders with ace queen plus
so the problem with this is that you're
going to be playing a strategy that is
always checking very very frequently
and allowing your opponent to realize
they're angry by checking behind
okay so this is something that a lot of
the times you see the server avoids the
solver avoids having these super high
checking frequencies
by playing depolarized strategies and
when the server plays depolarized
strategies
with a protected range okay so you can
see that
just because it's a depolarized strategy
it's not a capped range so you're going
to see ace is going to that range
even a scheme going to that range very
frequently
so you play a strategy where you prevent
your opponent from
uh having both things the opportunity to
check behind if he wants
and the opportunity to polarizing
himself against you
and driving the view of their bluff
catchers towards zero
okay so this is something
someone [ __ ] among somebody who would
post they had links and chats we can
have to manually do so we don't have to
manually do that
just like this you mean
let me know if that works yeah that
makes sense you guys can
follow along on your browser as well
so this is something that is very common
to see at low stakes so you can very
rarely see someone playing
these kinds of strategies on lower
stakes it has become more common at
higher stakes
but even at high stakes i feel like
people are still not
doing it enough okay and this introduces
obviously this introduces a level of
complexity to your strategy
right and this is something that
generates a lot of debate
for people who are trying to become
professionals or are trying to improve
in poker
do i simplify my life by playing a
simplified strategy
and then making it less likely that i
will make mistakes
or do i increase complexity into my
strategy
with the hopes that i'll make less
mistakes than my opponents
so i think this is a fair debate and i
think
depending on the level you are right now
depending on which stage you are in your
career you're going to have
different answers for this question uh
but ultimately i think if your goal is
to continuously
move up mistakes you have to be ready to
add complexity to your strategy
okay so complex simplicity is very nice
when you still haven't matured in your
knowledge when you still feel insecure
about certain place but you got to be
ready to increase complexity
and thankfully for us we have this
amazing platform
that is gta wizard where we can practice
right we can drill the spots we can
study the solutions
so don't be afraid of adding complexity
to your strategy
then ask does the people are strategy
added in the spot if people aren't going
to call
wide enough on the turn so
so you seem to be making an assumption
that your opponent could be overfolding
is that it
yeah so there are many ways to answer
your question
one thing one way to answer this would
be that
gto is never going to have a strategic
option that doesn't add ev to the
strategy
it may not add too much but if it's
being used it's because it adds
some okay so first of all is to
understand that this adds a v2 strategy
against gto opponent
if then your opponent is uh
in balance in a way he's not responding
correctly to this back sizing
then you're certainly gonna add ev to
your strategy with some parts of your
range
okay so what would be the parts i'm
gonna revert this back to the chat
what parts of our range here would have
their ev increased
if the ip decides to fold more
than the buttons holding here what do
you guys think which hands are going to
have their ev increase
if the ip let's say starts over 40
pocket knights
starts folding seven spear instead of
calling sometimes
what else uh maybe he's going to lack
razors as well his hands like pocket
twos pocket threes raising a lot but
you're guessing
no one wants to take a step the sensor
the merge part like 10x and bluffs
bluffs and all vulnerable hands
over folding third pair worse
yeah so the first obvious answer would
be the air right so
the air component of your range
obviously makes much more money when
feeling checked that when phil unfolds
then when he calls so pretty much any
air type hand that is betting here is
going to have their easy increase
so we're banning hands here such as jack
knight we're betting hands here such as
king queen jack queen jack so all those
hands are going to have their
v increase every time the button decides
to fold more than he's supposed to
at equilibrium and then very well put by
some people
uh some vulnerable hands some marginal
hands will also have their ev increased
okay because you would rather get a fold
when you bet with the hand like let's
say
some hands that were betting here pocket
sevens so if you're betting here with
pocket seven
you would rather get a fold than to get
a call okay so
all of these uh relatively marginal
hands that you're putting into your
blockback range here
will also have their ev increased if
your opponent decides to
miss some calls okay obviously the top
of your range
might lose a little bit of ev but every
deviation
that villain makes compared to
equilibrium will increase in your very
strategy
okay so uh you don't have to worry about
that
if he makes a mistake of holding too
much you will make more money than you
should
and that's already enough reason for you
to
not be concerned too much obviously this
might cause you to want to play
the top gear range in maybe some
different ways
but the point is if you stick to that
strategy you will make more money than
you should
right so uh this is just one example
where you're going to have these depolar
strategies this is
mostly happens out of position so auto
position is really costly for you
to always keep polarizing your ranges
and checking super often
and allowing your opponent to polarize
himself okay so
uh if you're playing and we're we're
going to be playing our position a lot
of the times
so we're going to be playing three bad
parts of the position super often
we're going to be playing singer it's
not our position very often
so every time you play a super polarized
charities and you fail to include these
people rs charges
you will have your ev decreased okay and
sometimes you might even
you might you might even end up making
more mistakes because of that one common
mistake that people do when they don't
play
depolarized strategies is that they also
in the process
end up capping their checking range so
you're going to see that here
even with the strategy that includes the
block by sizing
you still have to check a screen at some
frequency
you still have to check its jack very
often you have to check
10 super often you have checked aces
sometimes
so it's very easy for someone to
construct a strategy where they just
pure bat a speed plus
and then have all these kings queens
jacks in their checking range
so if you do that you definitely can get
exploited by a lot
by the opposition player okay
dragon super s so is the turn the main
street
we can depolarize i would say in all
streets you're going to see a lot of
depolarized strategies on the flop we
obviously see a lot
the block bed size is the most frequent
one when it comes to c-bending on the
flop
you see that on the turn a lot pretty
much any line double barrel line the
lacy bed line
and you see that a lot on rivers as well
uh
the only line on the river where you're
not going to see too many people are
aspects
is when your range construction is very
polar which usually happens on
continuous aggression lines so when i
say continued aggression i just mean
that you
made an aggressive action on the
previous streets so imagine you back
flop and turn
generally gonna get to the river with a
very polarized distribution you have
some very strong hands and some very bad
hands then in those cases it's very rare
that you're going to have
a deep polarized charity because you
simply don't have middling strength
hands
in your range okay but pretty much any
other line
you're going to see the solver playing
very deep polarized
okay you're going to see some other
examples as we go through today
with the other links all right so this
would be an example here i think
turn double barrel is where people use
the least
uh as i mentioned you're going to have
some depolarized bats in the lacy beds
as well
so let's imagine let's take a different
board here
let's imagine the flop board was
jack no jack h6 okay jack h6
so all the swap we're going to see that
we size up more often than not
so we're going to be even using some
over bats in the swap
let's imagine the turn goes jack jack
and let's say we get a king turn okay
off suit king
so we're going to see that on the off
suite king we also play
a very deep power ride strategy we're
going to have a lot of over bets of
course because the king
hits a range we're also going to have a
lot of half
pots and a lot of blocking bats as well
and i think on this line a lot of people
are already aware
they have to play a more depolarized
batting strategy
but a lot of people still are just
polarizing to king x plus and checking
the rest
that's certainly going to be a mistake
and you're going to lose
some ev by doing that all right so you
see here for example
even a head as weak as pocket nines rock
batting super often
you have a hand like uh nine eight
so third pair here going for the block
that 10
8 then you have all sorts of hints like
intense
and then also some unique jackets and
then you also get to have the portion of
the range that wants to pour rice so
these things are not mutually
exclusively exclusive
uh you can definitely have some portions
of a range that benefit from polarizing
and supporting
the range the benefit depolarized but
the point is that
if you keep just checking seventy
percent of your range
you just make your opponent's life very
very easy
okay so that would be the first thing i
want to point out
when you're studying with gto make sure
you give yourself time to study these
strategies and implement
them into your game and one very good
bonus you're going to have
with these content strategies is that
it's really hard for upon us to react
properly
we saw that previous example i'm going
to come back to it
because it's even more illustrative of
this point
which is that when you play that
strategy you force your opponents to
develop significantly
while raising strategies okay because
if if the imposition player here makes a
mistake of
not raising too much price or polarized
bets again you're going to have very
increased and you're going to be able to
exploit that opponent
by shifting all those mixed strategies
to pure strategies
okay so we see head the imposition
player is making our 10x
difference between blocking and checking
but you're going to see that this this
strategy flight ap player
is not very easy at all he has to find
uh 30 of raises with the smallest sizing
and this includes some non-intuitive
plays like
taking a random 10 and raising uh
raising a lot of asex even once
with not very strong kicker like ace
nine
and a bunch of bluffs with the pocket
parrot region like deuces threes
fives and some five four so you're going
to put your opponent in a tougher spot
than if you just keep checking 70
of your range okay and every time he
makes a mistake of not raising enough
here
you increase the view of your strategy
with this part that
is being made different by the gto
player okay and i believe
this will happen very often in practice
let's see if there's someone else
waiting to be accepted thanks for a
heads up
yes there are eight people on the limbo
here
thank you thank you match
uh the gto keep depolarizing the river
after depolarized times sea bass the
lazy bats
very good question from benjamin and
this is usually going to be true
and it's going to be true because you
have
a you have a depolarized range
construction here so you have a bunch of
middling strength hands padding
so if you have a river that doesn't
change the equities too much
then you again you have a situation
where you have a bunch of building
straight hands that benefit from getting
small
and you can still do that so let's
imagine you bet this
guy called and what would be a perfect
blank
here
guess i guess a2 would be blank enough
so if you have a two and
here's a strategy graduate player we
have 38 percent of blocks
again on this river so the reason for
this is of course
again you have a range composition and
we can take a look
at the accurate distribution graph here
and
blue is the small blind green is the
button so if we go from
here this would be roughly
i guess these numbers are the equities
so this is maybe something like 30 from
35
of a range maybe i would say 35
to 35 of a range to let's say something
like
60 percent of a range you have middling
strain hands you have hands that have
middling equity
that benefit from very small so you're
going to see the solver
putting those small bands there okay so
whenever you have
this range construction where you have a
bunch of feeling straight hands
and you have good hands as well as to
not be exploited
right this is important you can't just
be putting a lot of clean value bats in
a spot where you can't
okay because your opponent is just going
to martyr with artery with raises
but this is a spot where you still get
you with a bunch of aces
you still get here with some tens even
though you're checking because you
belong
check back range but you have it in your
range
you have a bunch of two pairs you have a
bunch of these sex so you're very well
protected in a sense that
feeling can't just be super aggressive
against your blocks
otherwise he's going to run into the
nuts too often okay so
this is going to happen very good
question by my benjamin
is hayao asks when you start to
depolarize in the turn see that hands
like queens the next name for eight
if you're going online on the river with
the strong hands and you check
our bad small river your check and small
bed range would be weaker to
exploit with well this is basically on
what i'm saying here right so you're
going to add complexity that's in fact
and you're going to be able to include
heuristics in your game
that allow you to not be super
exploitable so for example
one very good heuristic you're going to
have is that very good hands that block
your opponent's check back range
will often go to the checking range so
here yes you have a bunch of hands that
want to check
which are the 10x combos and then if you
only check 10x you would be exploited by
the ap
player but here you see that the solver
places 10 as a pure jack on the river
because if you take a look at the
checkback range by the ap
player pretty much all of the position
players check back range
are going to contain a 10 not all but
very frequently
a 10 is going to be a part of your
opponent's jackpack range
so when you have tense you get back into
more often which increases
and then with aces for example ace is
going to be indifferent between betting
have fought and betting and block sizing
and it never gets to go
in because it has heavy blockers to
quality range this is heuristic that you
can use as well
if you block your opponent's calling
range when you size up too much
then that's probably a reason why you
should size down so here if you apply
those heuristics you're going to be very
well protected from getting exploited
you have ac your broadband range and you
do that because you block too much of
the calling range when you size up
and you have tens in your checking range
because that blocks your opponent check
behind range
okay so two simple but very effective
heuristics
that you get to use on this spot okay
creatine set do you recommend to start
using these 20 percentage sizes on
ace and four eight boards i'm used to do
33 flop and turn
yeah so pretty much let's say i'd say
like ninety percent of pools on low
stakes use the 30 sizing
that's the sizing that became mainstream
let's say four years ago
when i was moving up in stakes i saw
that that was being used a lot there was
a lot of
a lot of hype to that sizing but if you
solve a lot of flops and run a lot of
negative reports you see that the 33 is
not really
the preferred by the solver okay the
server does use much more often than 25
which is one that i use a lot and the
solver even uses
as small as ten percent of the pot a lot
of the time okay so
uh if you want to be super accurate and
super precise
i would say you should drop the 33 and
use
uh 125 and maybe even have a
10 bad size in your arsenal uh
but of course tvs are going to be
similar okay if you played that 33
sizing with the right frequencies you
should be able to retain
99 percent of the ev okay but
when it comes to exact software
solutions solver does like to size down
a bit more right i'm gonna move on
because i spent 30 minutes
on just the first and we have
more things to talk about but hopefully
this one
was an interesting one for you guys so
you can start implementing into your
game
make sure you make a lot of drills all
right it's not like you're going to be
able to implement this correctly
from night to day you have to deal with
these spots you have to try and make
sense of
the things that are happening so make
sure you use the practice mode
to prepare yourself for these spots
michelle parmentier
[Music]
that's probably french i don't know how
to pronounce it so i'm sorry
how do you differentiate between spots
where
you should depolarize between spots
where you should equalize and those
rates matter to polarize
how often does it happen op versus
that's a really good question but also a
a very complex one answer there are
going to be some
some let's say criteria or let's say
circumstances that favor
one strategy or the other it definitely
happens way more often out of position
than in position because in position you
don't really
need depolarized strategies to increase
our heat you can just check behind
when you're out of position the problem
of checking so often
is that you still need village check
behind for you to realize you're acting
so it's a better way to realize your
acne by betting small then check
okay there are many reasons for this
that i won't be able to get into this
today
but the point is out of position it
happens way more often
than in position okay but it does happen
in position sometimes
uh and one point that you should keep in
mind for out of this to be polarizing
is that first of all you need to have
really straight hands in your range
right so if you don't have middling
straight hands in the range
then there's no point in playing a table
or a strategy you just want to
that big with your hands and then
balance with gloves so first of all you
have to have milling straight hands in
your range
uh you have to have some nuts in your
range otherwise you can get exploited so
you're never going to see silver
or very rarely going to see solar
depolarizing when it lags
nuts okay because then you can just you
just get marked by the ap
player so these these two things are
necessary conditions for you to find
those depolarized strategies
okay uh
all right so let's move on to the second
leak
[Music]
the second link i think is one that
people have become increasingly better
at at reducing loosely i would say but
it still happens a lot and i would say
even
at higher stakes certainly at 500 new
and certainly summer eggs at high stakes
which is the lack of over best okay
so you're going to see that
well this is no limit holding right and
for a lot of years
uh looking back now from the years i
started obviously it was times where
people were still not using solvers too
much and
there was not too much knowledge around
what optimal strategies look like
but looking back now it felt like
it felt like this is spot limit holding
oh yeah
very rarely you would see people over
betting and putting people in tough
spots
and going all in for massive bets and
then this has increasingly become more
common
uh as the solvers became popular and at
high stakes i would say you see it a lot
uh but at mid stakes and lower you very
rarely see it
and it's something that can have a
significant impact to your dvd
okay so uh lack of over bets i would say
is a very significant leak that most
mid stakes all the stakes players have
so i have two examples here
of some situations where you can start
implementing
bigger the first one is a c bad spot
so we open 2.5 here on the button and
we get called by the big blind the flop
is ace king 7
if we went back 3 years from today you
would see
99.9 percent of people see betting range
for one third of this board
right but then solvers start to become
more popular people
started to investigate a little bit more
and get more curious
and make different sims and people start
to see oh wow
we should really be getting our hands on
these kinds of boards and we should
actually be putting
lots of pressure to the big blind scouts
these double broadly two-tone boards are
ones in which you're going to see
the button playing a lot of over bats as
the flops
okay and it makes perfect sense you have
a composition of ranger
you have an advantage and you have a ton
of hands that have
no interest in increasing the size of
the pot
so if you take a look at these they
absolutely
want to check they have no reason of 40
months to put
and the reason for this is that first of
all some of these
don't require any protection let's take
a look at queens for example queens
there are no over cards to queens on a
skiing board
there's no weak hands that you would
like him to fall
and once you bat small and get called
villain
has a lot of asacs and king accents
range so every time you put one into the
pot with these hands
you decrease your accurate versus
continuing range okay so
you're going to see the solver just pure
jacking back to his hands
and then of course mixing some checks
with asak's hands
but mostly pure betting with ace queen
plus
and then some other hands okay so
uh i would say the second link i see a
lot for people is just
uh not sizing up enough when their range
allows them to
so flop is uh is one of the examples
where you can place overlaps where
people
normally don't and there are many
tactics where you can do this
one example is uh double broadly
two-tone
another example are lower textures
where you have ex insane advantage on
over pairs
so let's say you have a board like this
1083
[Music]
and villain checks you go ahead and
fire 80 percent of your range with the
overbet sizing uh you see there are a
lot of
three-quarter bats as well if you want
to simplify just the over bet i think is
totally fine
and you're going to see some very
frequent bets here in a spot where
if you bend small you just allow your
opponent to continue with
a super wide range and you get raised
quite frequently which reduces
the realization of many other middle
extreme hands so you don't want to get
here
and bat fold with pocket sevens you know
that would be stupid
so you just go ahead and check behind so
you just polarize your betting range and
start placing bigger bets
okay so flop is one instance where you
can start doing this
and putting more pressure to your
opponent's cap range
and another very significant example is
double barrel strategies as well
when you rip you can be ipo oop whenever
you have a very high spr
and you have a very significant
advantage you see the solver
placing very frequent over best okay
uh is over bad 3e
sizing i think on these simulations you
three for people that don't know
is just a how do i say this
nomenclature is is a word it's just an
annotation that
pl solver uses to refer to the geometric
bad sizing
so three is geometric sizing for three
streets
uh i don't think the seven here's the
geometric size but it doesn't matter all
that much okay
all that matters is that you should be
betting bigger than the size of the pot
in these situations the eight nine three
two tone has more of a bet than this one
yes that should have a little bit more
but it's all very similar anyway
okay so imagine you have a king seven
deuce rainbow board now you're at the
bottom of your speed blind
you're going to be see betting most of
your range on this texture
as it's a very favorable for you so we
have you even gto just
put batting the sport okay call and the
turn is a queen
so now when the turn is a queen you have
a very significant advantage
in the top equity heads so we're taking
a look again
at the graph here you see that pretty
much
any part of the top end of hands you're
going to have a significant
advantage in equity here any amount of
hits
so your range is just strong enough to
start placing something that's
here we have 160 percent of the pot i
would guess
that if you would allow even a bigger
bank it would be used here
and then you put a lot of pressure to
the big bite range
and you make sure you capture uh
the most amount of value with the top of
your range okay and
not getting the most value at the top of
your range is going to be
a very costly leak for your ring rate
okay so if you're constantly betting two
thirds three-quarters half part
when your range one's too bad to xbot
that's certainly gonna add up
to your uv okay so make sure you
are squeezing the most value possible
out of your strongholds
yes the size used by two is slightly
greater than three for the spot yes it
is
but it doesn't really matter too much
okay you don't the the geometric sizing
is not necessarily the
highest tv sizing it's just a easy to
use one
okay so make sure you're placing your
bats and there are going to be many many
spots
where you can be including over that's
including river spots
okay so flap spots turn spots river
spots
whenever you can identify that your
range has significantly more strong
hands than your opponent
you should be sizing up with your range
okay so put tons of pressure
whenever you can identify that your
opponent lacks
the strong hands in his range
and you know this is gto land
in practice land against humans you're
going to see that
this opportunity is going to open up to
you way more often than it should
because there are a lot of players that
play unbalanced
strategies on prior streets which make
the
which makes their range capped more than
they should
on the further streets okay so
here we see uh the solver software's
already playing a very aggressive
strategy with
check raises uh it's check raising pure
almost all of the two pair plus uh but
imagine the solver
wasn't doing this and the population is
therefore
villain gets to the turn with the more
capturing than you shoot
and you get to size up into a range
because you have more equity
okay so in practice i would say you have
even more opportunities to do this to
put more pressure to opponent's range
than the solver because people are not
very good at playing mixed strategies
they're not very good
at protecting their range as i think
someone said in the beginning
right when i was asking i think two or
three people said that people are not
very good at
protecting their range or check calling
the top of the range
that's absolutely true so if you can
have high confidence that your opponent
is doing this
then you have incentive to be even more
aggressive in the solver
when it comes to your bad sizing okay so
that's the second leak i would like to
tell you guys
the third one is also one that i think
some of you mentioned when i asked
which is let me get this in a sec
how the recreational generally reacts
over best is it common for people to
wrongly call more
versus over that's than pod bats because
they believe you're more
poor uh fab you i know okay for
i've done research population tendencies
for years and i've never seen
people over calling versus older vets
okay i've never seen people calling more
of our silver vets compared to what the
solver does
so i would say this it's pretty much
never gonna happen
well never is a very strong word right
so let's not say never but i would say
very difficult yeah
guys again i'm talking a lot here if you
want to interrupt me and ask a question
just feel free okay if you want to see
something in the simulation as well
just let me know uh
now to the third one the third one is i
think is a massive one
massive one and
it is one that funny enough
gets naturally exploited
by how population plays when they are in
the opposite
situation and i'll explain you guys
understand
so the third one i think is lack of
raises
okay lack of raises and when i say
raises
it is general just as i'm saying it
raises everywhere
but i selected a particular spot but
this is going to become very evident for
you guys
how aggressive gto is with raises and
how population
and even yourself most likely is leaking
a lot in this spot okay
so now we are on the same board so king
seven deuce
and then the turn of the queen but
instead of double barreling we decided
to check behind
so we decided to check behind and this
is the strategy for
the opposition player on the river and i
selected a very blank river like defined
here
it's not necessarily the most blank
possible because interacts with some
ends
but it should be should be blank enough
and first thing you're going to see is a
very deep polarized strategy here with
the 7x region
which a lot of people don't do so a lot
of people just take the 7x and put in
their checking range
uh and you see the solver is just pure
batting these hands with the block
sizing
so again an evidence of the lack of
depolarized strategies that we mentioned
in the first place and then
against the sizing this is a one-quarter
part size bed the button should be
playing a very aggressive rating
strategy of
almost 26 percent raising frequency here
with 15 of small raises and 11 of big
bases
and even a hint like queen jack which is
second pair here
and not the strongest kicker is pure
raising small
against the block size and then you're
going to see a bunch of kleenex
asmix strategy raises and of course
you're going to have
all these uh air combos being played
as raises as well so for humans i would
say even for high stakes players
it's really hard to get this such an
aggressive raising strategy
with with all these hands like taking
all these errors and mixing into raises
and most importantly i feel taking these
second pairs
and mixing into raises now you have to
do this
unless you become exploitable by the big
blind and he can start block betting
first of all shifting these big
strategies towards pure strategy bets
because you're not punishing them enough
with raises and even start blocking some
even weaker hands
so i've take a look at pocket six in
here take a look at the evs
so the view of block betting six is
already quite close to checking
uh if the ip player starts not raising
enough
then very quickly these hands are going
to become pure block bets for a
definition player
and you guys to squeeze more ev out of
the pot
okay so i would say people really really
struggle you probably really really
struggle with this
and you have to start implementing more
raising your strategy making your
opponents
life a little bit harder right just and
there are even some people that just
call
top pair in the spots like the guy takes
king three
and just pure calls that would be a very
significant mistake
uh we're going to see here the
differences is point final big blind
here
of course isolated in one combo in one
spot is not going to be much
but if you take that 0.5 big 0.5 oblique
blind per hand
across multiple combos in a range across
multiple different spots
this is going to add up very quickly to
your strategy
okay so make sure you also understand
your necessity
for finding raises in spots and
punishing people from betting too much
and as i was saying i think this leak of
the player pool
gets exploited by itself in a natural
way because people tend to bet or
that they shoot a lot of spots so if
you're not punishing people with
raises you are going to be naturally
exploited by what your opponents are
doing
we saw in that in that hand with the ace
where this is this is another example
where let's say you're playing versus a
very strong opponent
who identifies that he has depolarized
on these asex boards
if you all of a sudden start missing all
those mixed charity races
then the v for him to be banning all
those building hands
skyrockets okay so make sure you
study these grids and get more
comfortable with
playing more aggressive strategies i
know this is this can be hard because
sometimes it
it conflicts with some beliefs that we
have that
make us play more needy so
we have some preconceptions that you
know second pair is not worth the raise
so you never raise that even though it's
pure raised gto end
so get rid of some free misconceptions
and start studying these grids so that
you can play more aggressive
if we assume the field is not
depolarizing enough isn't a good exploit
to raise or polarize ourselves
yes if you have absolute confidence
let's say
that this player never blocked that 7x
then for sure the exploit for you would
be to start just calling with
the queen x combos but again we're
talking about here
you attempting to find the proper gto
plane
if your opponent is making a mistake and
you are
and you are playing the gto strategy you
will make more money than him
now if you want to play max exploit
that's a different thing
okay so if you want to counter your
opponent's imbalances
then i would say you have to study
population tendencies and you have to
use the proper models to
to get to the right conclusions okay
because it's very easy to make wrong
assumptions
it's very easy to justify explanative
place
that are not necessarily backed up by
data
okay so yes you are correct in your
assumption but first of all
try to understand how you should play
yourself correctly in theory
and then if you want to dig deep into
explorative poker
then make sure you're gathering data
about how your opponents are playing
okay but good question
all right this is one so you're going to
see this happen in a lot of different
situations i think some people mentioned
raising blind versus blind versus
seabeds i think i have one hand here
where we can cover this yeah so for
example we have here
king 83 board this is small blind versus
big blind
so you're going to be opening the small
blind getting caught by the big blind
you're going to be spending a lot of the
small size in here the suburbs do check
yet third of the range here
a lot of people are going to be just
betting range on this board
giving that it's a dry key high board
and then when they bet the big blind has
to come up with
16 of raises if we sum up the total
frequencies here
and it's going to have a lot of mixed
strategies in the top pair region and
even some big strategies with the second
pair region so you have a lot of 8x
raising and a lot of random air as well
with backdoors
so imagine you're playing against an
opponent that
wants to simplify their life in their
betting entire range
so they're betting entire range they're
betting more than they should
and you're making their life even easier
by not
finding the proper gto raises so if you
play that strategy you're certainly
giving out pv to report
okay all the hands that he has that
would be mixed strategies at equilibrium
now suddenly become very clear bets and
make much more money by betting because
you're just
not punishing them enough with raises
okay so the first step for you should
be to always at least find the amount of
ways that gto
finds if later you want to study your
population you'll see that they're doing
something differently
that incentivizes you to maybe uh
counter them a certain way
that's great but first of all you have
to get familiar
with the grids in the in the sovereign
land
to to at least be able to be meeting
these frequencies
okay and it's not easy at all you're
going to see some hands like
four deuce suited raising a bunch of 3x
raising uh what else a bunch of
asex obscu cans raising here so
if you have never studied these grids
it's very easy to play these hands
as pure calls and all of a sudden
instead of raising 16
you're raising 10 and then your opponent
just gets to that 82 cards into you
okay so make sure you're uh
polishing your game in a direction of at
least finding
the proper amount of raises that the gto
strategy
uh requires all right
awesome the fourth one
that i would like to point out is lack
of bluff catches
so someone pointed this out i think the
beginning
uh by using the term overfolding right
and when we say overfolding which is me
that
the situation in which we believe people
are folding a bit more than what the
solver solution
suggests and i picked up an example here
where we open the button for 2.5x
we get three back of the small blind and
then we call
and then we have a low board on the flop
something like 10 74
it could be in a little work because
you're going to see similar defense
strategies on
these little boards so we have a 10-7-4
board
villain is mostly going to size up uh
block batting on the sport is going to
be
really terrible because your opponent
gets to float everything
so you don't make you almost don't make
any hand in different
when you size this much any hand is a
plus if you continue for your opponent
so make sure you size up and
while you do size up uh you do about
half pot you could even have some two
thirds but i believe here on this board
and then you call a feeling that's you
call
i think the turn i had here was
blank i think yeah something like three
[Music]
uh here we have this uh 67 bet
you're going to see some raising
strategies here so again
it could be a node where you're lacking
raises you're going to see sovereign
pure shopping 76 uh pure shopping 10
9 push up ace 10. so it's a spot where
the pot is already very big and you want
to deny
realization to some of the over cards
that your opponent has
uh that has two overs to pretty much all
your bluff reactions here
so you just go ahead and shove so let's
say you call
and let's say the river i put the queen
i think
yeah and then there's just like
44 percent of the pot behind villain
gems
and then you're going to be forced
calling down with some hands that
most people consider very weak in terms
of absolute strength
and they are indeed very weak but the
thing is that
you don't really have a super strong
range on a low
disconnected board and of course the bed
sizing is small enough
that if you start overflowing here all
of the air in their opponent's range is
going to have very
increased so you're going to see six is
calling
two thirds of the time or sixty percent
of the time i would say
uh forty percent of the time calling
pocket fives pure calling down pocket
nines
almost and then a bunch of seven x also
calling the spot with eight
seven being a pure call so it's very
easy for a lot of players
to just go ahead and say okay oh he's
really strong
my hand is really weak i'm just going to
fold
but you could also be getting naturally
exploited by your opponents okay because
it's very easy for people to just
barrel on these little boards with their
high cards
so if you play a strategy that is over
fooling in a spot where your opponent
could be potentially bluffing a little
bit too much
then you're going to lose a lot of vb so
make sure
you are finding these calls don't be
afraid of pressing the call button
there's a lot of people that have this
speaking section that
everyone under bluffs so i have to fold
everything
that's not true okay that's not true uh
of course there are some situations in
which people can't find the proper
bluffing frequencies
but from my experience even at low
stakes
you're not going to find many people
they are just playing
completely valued strategies that they
don't have bluffs
okay so make sure you're finding the
calls that you have to make
because you could be getting naturally
exploited
by your population and this this comes
with
experience and again i heavily encourage
you guys to use the practice mode
the practice mode is to me
one of the best possible ways for you to
improve at poker
when trainers came up i think the first
trainer to come up
was uh um
yeah i think it was super tricky trainer
back in 2000
2018 19 maybe
um and then i was i was really hyped
about it because we never had those twos
where we could just
drill spots over and over until we
understand how it works
and then i think gto wizard makes this
extremely easy for us
you can drill any spot that you want you
can practice the entire hand or
practice specific spots and this helps
you build your intuition around how to
play certain spots
because let's be honest if you're just
grinding you're not going to have too
much experience in some very
specific notes they're just not going to
happen very often so it's
extremely extremely important that you
use this function
to get more familiar with the spots and
to
tune your intuition right to to get
better at identifying
how the gtl solution plays out okay
funky monkey said how much would you be
adjusting the spot on a high rank
environment
where the amount of the pot you will be
winning is smaller so this is a very
good question
and rake does impact defense frequencies
okay because whenever you win the pot
you know when the full pot
however the way that most sites seem to
work is that they
keep uh they keep charging the rake
per street so you go from pre-flop to
the flop
they charge five percent you go from
flop to the turn they charge five
percent
if the cap hasn't been hit and you go
from the turn to the river
they charge by a percent if the cat
hasn't been hit
okay so by the time you get to the river
that cap has been hit
way long before okay so in these big
pots on the river i don't think
it's much of a concern but it does
impact let's say flop defense strategies
swap defense frequencies
uh if you go from 5k and l to 50 now
you're certainly going to have
very different defense strategies okay
but for these spots i don't think it's
going to matter much
uh how about the if you have these hands
which we should be calling shoe
should be should be us looking for
some specific eevee
i mean more than one ev five eight zero
b
something like that um
okay so
of course the biggest mistake you can
make is folding a hand that is pleasing
right so if you pull the hand that is
plus cv because poker is a zero sum game
every ev that you fail to win goes to
your opponent
so let's say you have jack 10 here so
the view of calling jack then is 30 big
lines
if you somehow fold jack then that's 30
big blinds that's going to our
opponent's direction
okay so obviously don't make the mistake
of folding
pure strategies that would be insane but
even if you fold
zero ev hands that are mixed strategies
uh
you're still going to be losing a v if
your opponent adjusts okay if your
opponent plays a fixed strategy
where he's just playing his thing he's
playing gto let's say and you over fold
the mixed charge region
then you're not going to be losing much
uv but then the exploit for your
opponent is very easy he just fires all
his blocks
and at the time he starts doing that you
start losing a lot of evil
and i think that's a way that a lot of
people play okay they
they don't control their frequencies
with their over cards and they're going
to end up over bluffing so if you over
fold the mixed strategy region
you're first you're going to be giving
rpd okay
so that's about it
what about 3-betting in gg with pre-flop
rate guys don't
make random questions about very
specific
situations okay because then i would i
would need to have
five hours of of coaching here to
address
everything let's try to to to discuss
what we're we're trying to see here okay
uh the final one i'm not gonna have time
to get into it
uh it's an important one so i may leave
this for
for a future future lesson uh but i
believe these four ones
are very relevant and you can start
paying you can start paying more
attention to this in your game okay so
just recap
depolarized strategies it's very clear
to me that
most people lack this in their game so
make sure you
study how to depolarize your range in
spots where
the gto strategy requires you to do so
okay so this is going to be
very frequent in most automation modes
flop
turn and a lot of times on the river
depolarized strategies over backs make
sure you put pressure
into your opponent's range whenever you
have nut advantage
okay so this is going to be double
barrel ranges triple barrel ranges
and even flopsy bat ranges depending on
the board
okay lack of raises make sure you're
finding the proper raises otherwise you
could be naturally getting exploded by
the population
by the profiles that that too much so
make sure you study the grids
to find the proper raising strategies
and lack of bluff catchers make sure you
also don't over fold
okay don't be afraid of clicking the
call button
sometimes this is very psychological you
feel like
you click call with sixes villain shows
king queen
and then you think you got owned or then
you think you just lost the stack
okay it's very difficult for this car to
be very minor cd
you have decent blockers so even your
opponent plays a slightly unbalanced
strategy
it's not like you're losing your entire
stack okay you might be losing
one big line with your call maybe two
big lines you're never going to be
losing your entire stack with your call
because people do have bluffs even if
they under bluff by a little
it's not like you're losing 50 big
blinds 40 big blinds with their call
okay so make sure you find the proper
defense frequencies
on the river all right guys
uh hopefully this was insightful for you
guys
i'm gonna leave maybe one two minutes
for you guys to ask questions if you
have any
and then we can wrap it up right what
did you
think of this format did you guys enjoy
it did you like it
um please leave feedback on the gto
words of discord so that we can come up
with more ideas for future
future coachings this was the last one
that was free for
everyone to join next time we're going
to be doing
[Music]
the session is going to be only visible
for
premium users okay so please leave your
feedback
leave your suggestions of things you
would like to see things we'd like to
cover
formats and so on okay i'm open to
any suggestion
all right sounds like people liked it
very happy about it guys very happy
then asked what would you say the best
way to integrate these upgrades
is using gto wizard using the reports to
understand frequencies
and then drilling or just drilling and
learning from mistakes
or some other technique awesome awesome
question by dan
so i talk a lot about this in my very
first video for what it once
it was a very well liked video let me
show it to you guys here
i think one of them is one of the most
liked videos on where it was
for the past few years and
obviously maybe you don't have a
subscription there
but if you do i would strongly suggest
you watch that video because
i think it's a it's basically what
you're asking
so i'm just going to bring it up here to
talk about it
so in this video it's called a
systematic process for strategic
development so here at the bottom
where's my very first video we run it
was back in 2019
and basically i tried to
to to give the viewers a very clear idea
of how i think
a very good process for integrating gto
looks like
and for sure i would say use aggregated
reports i can get reports i want the
best
ways to integrate gto concepts
because it gives you a very clear idea
of what the highest euv strategic
options are
for any given spot okay so if you can
study with aggregation reports
you're definitely going to improve much
faster because you're going to be able
to identify
which nodes what are the most
uh the highest tv studio options and
you're going to see for example
i think i'll get a report for the turn
are soon to come
right match if matt is here he can tell
us when
turn and video reports are going to come
uh this is an awesome way to study
for sure you're going to be able to see
weak spots you have to depolarize your
range for example
so i would say static negation reports
get a feel of which nodes play
weeds to precautions and then drill a
lot i would say
drilling is the best thing that you can
do for your game
to really quickly integrate how to play
different spots
and drilling with immediate feedback is
the best thing
possible because you get to know right
at the moment
what mistake that you made what was the
frequency all this and that
in our brains our brains are really good
at uh
identifying patterns right so if we can
use your brain
for for what it for it does well which
is identifying patterns we're absolutely
awesome at identifying patterns
then this is going to be a very good
format for you to learn okay
of course i also i also always suggest
students to study a lot with toy games
to to understand why if you don't do
something
then why is it bad for you that you're
not doing that so i would say a mix of
both things should be really nice
so again reports with drills should be
a very practical way of improving and
then
studying toy games as well so that you
can understand
why you have to do the thing that the
solver is telling you to do you know
because i think
both things need to need to happen for
you need to understand the why
and the how it's basically the y and the
hub
okay
so matt said that turn reports are top
priority for us
but they're going to be soon awesome
awesome is going to be
amazing and we're going to have a lot of
types of new solutions
amazing as well and we introduce guides
on how to study and detail some plans
for you so it's easier for you
you don't have to think what i should be
doing today that's a very common
struggle
for for most even professional players
and like what i'm going to do today they
sit in front of the computer and they're
like okay like what do i do now
and yeah so gta wizard is awesome in
that regard
you have this entire platform built for
you to not have to waste
any mental energy deciding how to do or
where to do
or when to do you just sit and you have
all this platform for you
all right so if you haven't yet
subscribed
for the love of god why are you waiting
and i'm not just saying this because
i am a partner of gta wizard proudly a
part of part of gta wizard
i'm saying this because this platform is
insane
okay if you still haven't subscribed you
are making a mistake
i have total confidence in saying this
you are making a mistake
if you're still not a premium user all
right
all right guys that's it for today hope
you liked it and
if you are a premier user i see you next
week
all right bye bye guys thanks for
watching
