### TOPIC: 5 ways to stay at low stakes forever
[Music] today we're going to dive into the 
ultimate guide on how to waste time buckle up  
as we unfold the secrets to ensure your study 
sessions are as inefficient as possible let's  
shuffle through these gamechanging tactics 
together and discover the five cardinal sins  
of Poker study habits that are guaranteed to 
prevent you from making progress because why  
aim for improvement when you can Master 
the craft of standing still let's Dive
In
[Music] tip number one memorize frequencies the 
most efficient way to waste your time studying  
poker is to try and memorize GTO frequencies 
so I want you to keep in mind that there are  
billions and billions of decision points in poker 
and so your goal is to try and rote memorize all  
of that if you can't do that how can you even call 
yourself a g wizard you need to know exactly how  
often each hand takes each action in every spot 
and whatever you do do not try to extrapolate  
larger ideas do not look for the bigger picture 
just focus on memorizing frequencies without  
understanding the strategy that is how you will 
stand still tip number two for wasting your time  
is to justify your spew when you look at a solver 
you shouldn't be thinking about what your range is  
doing you should not be focusing on the overall 
strategy instead you should review your hands  
look at only your hand in the solution and if 
it happens at any frequency good enough right  
focus on how your hand is supposed to play ignore 
your range and hey if you get cooler taking some  
wild line just justify it by calling it a lowf 
frequency play that is how Silvers were meant  
to be used tip number three focus on minua if 
you want to make the least amount of progress  
possible it is crucial that you spend hours 
studying tiny blocker effects and trying to  
figure out why calling is 0.01 big lines better 
than raising you should definitely spend all day  
trying to figure out why the silver raises 1.5% of 
the time in this River spot with this very strange  
combination ignore threshold analysis don't do 
any Global takeaways only focus on these minutia  
and that will ensure that you waste the maximum 
amount of time studying tip number four wander  
aimlessly do not try and prioritize spots do not 
try and figure out what spots are more important  
to study just study random hands you need to avoid 
developing some sort of study plan at all costs  
that will only help your progress if you want to 
stagnate in poker study routines are the enemy do  
not let yourself fall in the Trap of studying on a 
regular basis without going crazy tip number five  
is confirmation bias you already know how poker 
ought to be played there's nothing left for you  
to learn you should use the solver to confirm 
your own worldview rather than trying to learn  
new Concepts and hey you know what if the solver 
disagrees with your play it's probably not worth  
paying attention to make sure that you use the 
solver exclusively to feed your ego rather than  
try and learn new Concepts okay so you've learned 
the five cardinal sins of studying poker let's  
snap back to reality and assume that you actually 
want to improve and not waste your time I'm going  
to go through some GTO wizard examples and I'll 
show you the right way and the wrong way to study  
different spots all right so hijack opens cut 
off three bets they call flop is 9752 tone and  
then checks to you in position now let's say 
you're studying this spot the least efficient  
way to study it would be to Mouse over each of 
these combinations individually Ace 9 what is  
Ace 9 doing okay we're checking 37.9% of the time 
we're betting small a lot sometimes we're betting  
medium okay what about Ace 10 Ace Jack Ace Queen 
10 Jacks like guys this takes for every it's not  
a super efficient way to go ultimately if you want 
to study more efficiently you need to start with  
big circles and work your way down to smaller 
circles so big circles is like the big picture  
analysis and then only once you've got a handle 
on that do you work your way down to the smaller  
combinatoric stuff the easiest way to do that is 
to use this filters tab I love the filters tab  
the reason I like this is because it allows me to 
start thinking of hands in terms of hand classes  
grouping similar hands together so for example 
if I select sets now my strategy at the top  
shows just my strategy for sets and you can see 
they're mostly betting I can do this for any type  
of hand class or Draw or any combination thereof 
again the idea is to minimize the amount of stuff  
you have to think about so that you're getting 
more for your study time we're trying to group  
strategically similar spots together strategically 
similar hands together and try and take away as  
much information as possible with the least amount 
of time now let's say you want to study turns cut  
off bets hijack calls and what most people do is 
they'll just enter a single turn card here perhaps  
the turn card that was played in game but the more 
efficient way to study this is to start again with  
turn reports if I click turn reports hijack checks 
here I can see cutoff strategy with their entire  
range across all these different turn cards right 
and so this is going to be the quickest way that  
I can gain value from my study time because I 
can already develop heris like okay when the  
turn card brings a connecting card like a six an 
eight or a 10 here I should probably slow down  
quite a lot meanwhile I can start over betting on 
some of these board pairing cards and even some  
of these bricks and I should probably be pretty 
aggressive on these Broadway cards Jack queen or  
King something does pique my interest though why 
are we slowing down so much on an ace after all  
we're the three better that's odd let's go check 
the ranges I'm going to go back to cut off's range  
again going to use this filters tab to filter for 
ace high and we'll notice that most of the ace  
high are checking 63% of the time what that means 
is that when you bet you don't have these hands  
in range and therefore an Ace isn't actually that 
good for you another way you can use this imagine  
you're studying some particular hand in game Let's 
say you had Jack here for example what you can do  
is you can filter the turn reports for just this 
hand and instead of studying the exact turn card  
that came in game you can use these reports to 
study how Jacks should play across all of these  
different turn cards and again we can see very 
similar heris a seven and a nine okay we can  
even start over betting on this an overcard to the 
Jack okay now we're slowing down a lot I've done a  
lot of other videos on studying more efficiently 
but you guys get the idea the goal is to start  
with big picture analysis and work your way down 
rather than trying to memorize individual hands as  
a lot of newer players would all right so we've 
addressed number one now let's address number  
two justify your spew again one of the cardinal 
sins of studying is to focus on how your hand is  
supposed to play rather than your range and if you 
make a mistake but the solver is taking this line  
at some minute frequency you just say oh it's 
a low frequency play it's fine guys that's not  
how you should use a solver you shouldn't use 
it to justify bad play just because it's taken  
at some frequency doesn't necessarily mean your 
strategy was any good let me show you what I mean  
all right let me demonstrate this cardinal sin to 
you guys imagine you're reviewing a hand history  
and in this spot you add Ace three of Spades as 
the cut off you bet one/ third pot they call on  
the turn you think to yourself hey you know what 
I've just hit Top pair they've got lots of draws  
that'll probably call me let me put in another bet 
you bet and they get called Rivers is the nine of  
hearts and here you decide to go all in with Ace 
three you look at the silver and you realize oh  
okay it's mostly checking this hand but you know 
what it's shoving at a low frequency we'll call  
this a low frequency play move on nothing more to 
see here right meanwhile if you actually normalize  
your range you'll notice you never get here with 
ace3 what actually matters is it necessarily what  
ace3 is doing here in a vacuum it's how you're 
constructing your overall beding shoving frequency  
this informs the exploitability of your strategy 
let's imagine that ace3 shoves here what actually  
happens well let's examine what calls you so quads 
full houses flushes Straits trips and better top  
pair okay so the majority of hands that call you 
have you beat so is this really a value bet I mean  
maybe maybe you get like a merge call from some 
Jacks and tens I don't know if many humans find  
that what about folding okay well you fold out 
hands you beat such as low pairs low pairs low  
Pairs and you actually fold out a few better top 
pairs interestingly enough so you were maybe just  
overplaying your hand thinking it's a value 
bet in reality you were bluffing without even  
knowing it right and unless you stop to actually 
analyze your strategy you won't notice that and  
you'll just continue on playing the same way over 
playing your top pair in these types of spots the  
third cardinal sin focusing on minua and I see 
this all the time in the Discord server on the  
public forums people are not paying attention to 
what actually matters and spending too much time  
focusing on what basically comes down to Silver 
noise or inconsequential blocker effects returning  
to our River example imagine you get here with 65 
of clubs and you decide to turn your hand into a  
bluff and shove good for you but you'll notice 
that it's Bluff with 6 five of Spades 6 five of  
hearts and it's checking with 6 five of clubs in 
the summary tab we can even see that the EV when  
you have Spades is much higher than the EV when 
you don't have Spades what's going on here what  
is this to do with Spades is this like something 
important guys I have done more card removal  
analysis in my life than anyone should do if you 
actually go and calculate how holding each of  
these suits changes your opponent's frequencies 
it's minute it's not even a consider it's not  
worth thinking about at all this does not matter 
even a little bit this is not important here's  
a Block C effect that does matter let's take 
a look at king queen here in the summary tab  
you'll notice that King Queen of Diamonds is 
bluffing king queen without a diamond is not  
bluffing simply because you block the flush right 
that's as simple as you really need a lot of the  
stuff a lot of the times that you're spending on 
figuring out why one suit does this why the other  
suit does that first of all the effect is much 
smaller than you think it is secondly it's built  
on Range assumptions that are not realistic by the 
river that is to say like 3.7 big PL gain here is  
based on assumptions that aren't realistic about 
your opponent's range in reality there's so much  
more variance to their range that this is just 
basically goes out the window thirdly it's not  
important right spending a bunch of time trying 
to figure out like which combination of 65 is  
the best one to bet or 76 it doesn't matter what 
matters here is your overall range construction  
your value to Bluff ratio for this shove 
that matters a lot what doesn't matter is how  
often you're bluffing or what combinations you're 
bluffing with this particular hand that you rarely  
ever get here with now similarly let's say you 
shove and you're studying the opponent's response  
here and you might ask well why is it that Ace 
five of Spades calls more often than Ace five of  
hearts and again the answer is it doesn't matter 
it doesn't matter at all I promise you that the  
card removal effects are so negligible this isn't 
even a real consideration there are no look don't  
get me wrong there are times where blocker effects 
are important and have a big impact on your real  
EV this is not one of those times at all the only 
takeaway when you hold ace5 here is that your hand  
is indifferent that's the only consideration here 
right your hands the expected value of calling and  
folding are both zero your hands right on the 
line and you should decide whether or not to  
call not based on your suits but rather based on 
your opponent's Tendencies if you think they maybe  
over bluffing or under bluffing in this line and 
that's going to be true for basically all of your  
top pair they're all indifferent facing this again 
my advice is to not focus on these minute blocker  
effects but rather overall range construction 
things like what hand class is appropriate to  
shove here right so when cut off shoves they're 
mostly representing flushes full houses and  
quads for value they're very rarely representing 
anything worse than a flush for value returning to  
number four wandering aimlessly this one's really 
common it's really easy to just study random spots  
when you feel like it and have basically no plan 
preparation or sense of priority but it's a very  
inefficient way to study you can imagine you learn 
a little bits in pieces but you're not trying to  
pick the lowest fruit first you're not maximizing 
your study time now instead of studying random  
spots you can use one of the many free resources 
we have on GTO wizard to study more efficiently  
for example you can open up these study plans 
and try the mastering the basics of GTO this is  
a free study plan open to anyone with a GTO wizard 
account it's filled with articles guides videos as  
well as many drills that will teach you all about 
how to start studying in poker and how to master  
the basics of A game theory optimal strategy you 
can also watch some of my previous content where  
I've shown you how we can use math to break down 
what the most important formations are and what  
the most important textures are this is again 
just a nice simple way to prioritize the most  
important spots first and develop an actual 
quantifiable system for what spots you should  
be studying first lastly confirmation bias now I 
don't have a GTO wizard example for this because  
it's more psychological but let's take a look at 
the ironic slide you already know how poker ought  
to be played and you use the solver to confirm 
your own worldview rather than trying to learn  
new Concepts and if it disagrees with you it's 
not worth paying attention to just feed your ego  
this is subconsciously how a lot of people study 
I think in particular this is a common trap that  
regs fall into these are people who have studied 
have perhaps found a slightly winning strategy  
and then they just get stuck right they start 
playing the same way in the same spots without  
ever reassessing their strategy and mostly what 
they're using a silver for for that point on is  
just fine-tuning a very Break Even strategy 
rather than trying to learn new ideas again  
it's not very efficient when you see an outlier 
hand in GTA wizard when you see the solver doing  
something doesn't make sense to you is outside 
your worldview don't just dismiss it as oh it's  
crazy GTO nonsense there is a reason for that and 
if your opponent if you think that's weird it's  
probably because there's a deeper strategic idea 
that you haven't thought of before that perhaps is  
actually applicable not necessarily the play but 
the underlying concept if you can't look for ways  
to improve your strategy well you're just going 
to plateau and that's why it's really important  
to keep an open mind and remember that poker is 
far more complex than you give it credit for all  
right everyone that's my video let me know down 
below what bad study habits you're going to break  
after watching this video and if you found it 
helpful if you found it useful the best way

that's all for now happy grinding [Music]
