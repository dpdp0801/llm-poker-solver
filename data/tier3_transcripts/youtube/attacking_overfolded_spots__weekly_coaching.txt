### TOPIC: attacking overfolded spots
in today's session we'll be talking
about borrowing without equity
first of all i want to ask you what
spots do you find borrow without equity
let's define that
so if the board comes is high and we are
borrowing pocket juices or pocket trees
we still have equity right we have two
outs for a set
so the question is when are we borrowing
without any equity
without any over cards without anything
connected to the board do you guys have
any any specific spots uh where you do
that on a regular basis
and you find it working all right so
when we unblock villains draws
this is important one
when our hand
unblocks his faults
bluffing flushes
ferdinand says bluffing flushes what do
you mean by that bluffing monoboards
miss draws on the river all right
so
when flop goes check check against late
position flutter you borrow turn with
every hand well
not every hand in theory but you could
borrow every hand against some opponents
profitably so as you see there are
infinite cases where we can borrow
without equity and that's why i decided
to focus just on a few specific spots
and keep it more practical this webinar
so that we explore how we can exploit
our opponents in specific spots rather
than learning you know why are we doing
this and uh what part of range needs to
be defending and memorizing things that
as if you watched uh tom's uh webinar
about the bit about the big picture how
a memorizing doesn't work in poker so
i've chosen three categories of boards
first one monoboards i think ferdinand
said a bit about that
motherboard so three flush boards and
especially when completing another flush
cart on the turn
uh in those spots there are no bluffs
with equity so if there are four cropped
clubs on the board if we have another
club we have a flush if we don't have a
club and we're drawing for a straight uh
we could be drawing that against a flush
already so there are no
natural bluffs with equity when it comes
to motherboard then straight completing
boards these are the ones that i think
are very difficult to nail just because
how hard it is to be defending you know
one pair of hands or even two pair hands
on straight completing boards
and then
the last one which is a bit easier for
the aggressor is the locked boards ace
highs
or
parrot boards that are already locked
and they're not that many draws
so the first hand example will be coming
from the monoboards and we are
diving on a
queen six deuce three spades
utg against the big blind for 30 big
blinds effective as we already know
uh we should be
betting this board
uh
with a very high frequency in practice
betting the whole range here uh just
because uh how strong our range is
compared uh to the big blinds range of
course if we go to ranges uh we're going
to see how wide big blind range is and
you know as a percentage of the whole of
his whole range the hands that have 60
and above are you know
uh around 10 to 15 percent well in our
range as the aggressor as utg
we have uh
quite a lot more
so uh we're betting range on these
boards uh i'd rather bet you know my
whole range four quarter pot
uh instead of uh mixing it up with the
55 percent 33 and 20 it just becomes
much easier to execute
so
um
if we bet let's say the preferred sizing
here is 33 percent
if we bet uh 33
what do we see from the out of position
player uh that strikes me is first of
all the check raises
so the check raises here
um
of course the value comes from mostly
flushes
we see all those flushes check raising
but not every flush in fact most flushes
are just check calling
just because
of how we want to be playing our range
in general you know we want to be check
calling
uh
around 50 percent of our range and
raising just uh nine percent
so this is the overall strategy and
that's why we're check calling with most
of our flushes
well the flashes that benefit uh
uh to check raise the most from the big
blind are the ones with the three or
with the four that are unblocking uh you
know the bad cause from uh from the utg
or from the uh preflop aggressor
so uh we want uh to be um to be to get
caught with those flushes so we're check
raising you know king 3 instead of jack
9. uh so this is first thing about the
value and i think uh in practice people
check raise a lot more flushes
especially the low ones because you know
um
we tend to think that they need more
protection so 75 needs protection
against let's say age jack with a spade
or pocket tents with a spade
and then
by check raising more flushes
on the flop
their range becomes weaker on the turn
now let's see about the the blast so i'm
going to exclude
spades here
and see that
still there a lot of hands without the
spade check raising the flop so uh due
sex uh low due sex then some good shots
like um five four five three uh four
three uh six four and five six as well
because those can be turned into a bluff
on some runouts you know three four five
uh targeting to fault um over pairs or
even a queen on some run-outs
uh people uh of course don't do that i
almost never see players check raising
deus ex or 6x on this board unless i'm
playing uh you know maybe a 1k plus
buy-in and now when we go to the one
one spade
one spade bluffs
uh we're going to see
a decent amount of you know nine x of
spades seven x uh eight x of spades um
check raising and those are bluffs that
uh never uh really get check raised in
practice because you know if our
opponent causes then um another spate
comes what are we doing with a knife
high flush is just not strong enough uh
if we take those two population
tendencies into practice we're going to
arrive at the turn
with the big blind
having significantly weaker range which
allows us to be borrowing a lot of hands
without equity
so
if we bet one third here as utg
and the big blind calls
turn comes let's say another spate so it
comes
jack jack of spades
there is some leading here in theory but
in practice of course nobody is leading
this turn
just because of how complicated the game
three becomes after uh leading on a four
flush
uh then
they check their entire range and now
let's see what's going on
so we see uh
from the
uh from utg
uh we see a lot of hands uh that have
absolutely zero equity like king seven
of hearts or um king aid of diamonds
uh is for a suited without a spade so
ace four hearts a score is for diamonds
now um on on the jack
we do have some small betting for value
with queen jack you know pocket jacks
all those hands that we connect with but
if we go on a turn that is a little bit
more uh disconnected with the imposition
range now we see the clear picture
we see our bluffs betting big
and uh our value hands being um king of
spades or better so the queen of spades
uh you the queen of spades is down there
but the k the jack of spades usually
doesn't want to be evaluating this turn
just because of uh how many ace x of
spades and king x of spades we already
have in our range
so uh for our value hands here king king
of spades and
a spades but look at our bluffs so let's
uh exclude
again the spades from our range and look
at that beauty
so jack 10
jack 9 barling at a full frequency king
10 king jack
barling at a very high frequency without
a spade
and why is that
why do we borrow those those hands
of course
because um we don't really have any
other bluff so
barling 9 8 of here of hearts is no
better than barling king jack off
because 9 8 can even if it makes a
straight
it's it's not a big deal you know we're
not winning against a flush
so
let's see now what happens against the
big bad so we can think and practice uh
how successful this big bet is so if we
bet for 83 percent uh in theory we see
that the big blind needs to be defending
uh every two pair so we see six juice
never folding we see seven six never
folding queen six
queen juice and this is against eighty
three percent sizing
so this against the big size now if we
go to you know the flushes we start
folding some flushes here from the big
blind such as you know three of spades
five of spades especially if they're
with a king and the king uh com you know
king x comprised most of the imposition
bluffs such as king jack as we saw in
king 10.
now six five if we go to six five uh
we'll see five of spades calling the
turn uh every time we'll see you know
four spades calling quite a lot and i
think uh against the second barrel that
is a big uh here for for eighty eighty
percent or three quarter spots let's say
i think people have hard time defending
their range so they will not be able to
reach uh minimum defense frequency from
the big blind which of course if we not
lock for that
having in mind
uh the the flushes that they check
raised from on the flop you know we
spoke that a population check raises
more flushes on the flop from the big
blind than actually in theory then they
reach with uh turn with less flushes and
they need to be defending you know more
of these 4x low flushes 5x low flushes
which in practice never happens so
those both arguments they increase the
eevee
of our barrels
as the pre-flop aggressor with hands
that have absolutely no equity such as
you know ten nine jack nine ten eight um
you know those um hearts
now
uh you um
we out as we're going to the river we
have to keep in mind here
uh that
gto range
is significantly wider
than the range that our opponent will be
defending in practice and reaching the
river with
so
uh let's say a river comes blank
another
three you know three of hearts
of course big bronze checks again there
is no reason to lead this river
and we see um
the pre-flop aggressor blasting those uh
bluffs you know king jacks those jack
knives those 10 knives those 108s
now
we know that uh on the river the big
blinds range is a little bit stronger
uh compared to to the turn like um on
the turn if he's folding the four
high flush five high flush uh sometimes
maybe even eight high flush if he is a
passive player then he will not have
them on the river he'll not have two
pair on the river compared to gto so now
uh when we bet here
we see that uh in prague in gto uh
from the big blind we need to be calling
queen six queen seven uh you know most
queen juices
um
we need to be calling a pretty much
uh o2 pair
then the high flushes you know from
around nine and above
you we see here the evf 9x uh being um
around zero so that means uh 10x will be
calling every time right and atex will
be falling every time
but also when we're bluff catching the
river against an aggressive opponent i
think we need to be
very precise with our blockers so why is
a hand like queen five with a five of
spades better bluff catcher than eight
five
uh with a five with even with eight of
spades so this is a question for you
guys why are we check calling the river
with uh queen five five of spades but
we're check folding with eight five
eight of spades all right any other
suggestions
thiago says that
the queen doesn't block bluffs so those
uh those are the the two that i was
looking for uh when we are thinking
about
blockers we want to be of course
blocking their value range and
unblocking their bluffs in this spot
it's just very important to be
unblocking their bluffs that's why we
see queen six without a spade
calling just because utg does not have
any queen x or 6x in his bluffs and we
can clearly see that utg does not have
any queen in x and 6x in bluffing range
that that means that we are safe calling
those queen 6 and queen seven and even
you know queen four and queen five with
the five spades so
as we get to this river we have to be
uh thinking are we playing against gto
are we playing against uh uh an
aggressive opponent i would play against
a passive opponent and now
um i i'd like to
to draw some
conclusions about this about this one
so a population on this uh utg against
big blind monoboard first of all they
under check raise the flop
as we saw not check raising
bottom pairs not check raising middle
flush draws and imposition they
overfalled against czech race so i've
made these little arrows here and this
is to connect the logic so when we're
thinking about psychology in poker it it
works like that if i am not bluffing
this river when i face the same decision
on the river against somebody else i'll
assume that he is not bluffing it as
well so when we're playing ten tables
for example and we face a tough decision
on the river we are going to play out of
our own bias you know out of our own
understanding of the game so if we are
not check raising deus ex or bottom pair
on this jack 6 dues board this means
that
we'll assume other players are not check
raising those bluffs so we'll be over
folding against czech race and i just
went to a brief explanations about those
um you know disconnected logic here
so if population under check raises the
flop then they're over folding against
the check radius if they're under
bluffing the turn then they're
overfalling against the turn barrel and
if they under bluff the river then
they're overfalling against riverbarra
so the main exploits that will be taken
out from this spot first of all as the
player from the big blind uh we need to
be check raising the flop with a higher
frequency just because how hard it is
for players to be defending their range
against the check race and i want to
show that because it didn't show it in
our example so if we check race from the
big blind
uh what happens is that utg needs to be
defending uh you know pretty much all
pocket pairs even without a spade so
poked sevens without spade pocket dates
without spade then uh defending six sec
the six segments that they have
um defending uh some king jack without a
spade which is crazy like this will
never happen this will absolutely never
happen you check race queen six deuce uh
three spades nobody is defending king
jack without a spade so going back to
our exploits here check raising flop as
the big blind will be the first one on
the monoflop and then over bluffing the
turn as the pre-flop aggressor just
because of how hard it is to be
defending you know two pairs and low
flushes against a big size here
and then last when we reached the river
as the pray for progresser we have to be
very careful about what kind of opponent
we are playing against if he is a
passive opponent we should not forget
that he probably folded most of his you
know low and middle flashes uh by the
river so he's uh left with just the
strong flashes and he's probably calling
most of that so we need to be shutting
down the river if we're playing against
somebody who is more sticky then he has
a lot of low flushes from the turn going
into the river we can bluff him off
those hands now another mono board i
want to take a look into
is the one that we're playing out of
position low jack against against button
so uh 7 6 deuce i chose this one um
as it is low card so there are no um no
pairs there is a question before that
when we exploit him for falling too much
don't we get the turn with the super
wide range and he's super tight isn't
that a sign of slowing down thiago are
you talking about when we check race
from the big blind
yeah
well the exploit of check raising from
the big blind
with those bottom pairs
is very easy because when we get caught
we are just giving up uh a lot on the
turn just because of our assumption that
our opponent is defending less on the
flop so he is arriving at the turn with
the uh stronger range and then
if the turn improves our hand let's say
with those low
pairs uh
gut shots you know to a pair in a gut
shot
then we can keep borrowing to before to
to fold him off you know some of the
pocket pairs
but in general if we are check raising
this spot we definitely need to be uh
slowing down on the turn hope this
answers the question now uh we
are
uh
on a seven six deuce three space playing
low jack against the button of course uh
in this spot we're not betting a lot uh
out of position why is that we see uh
equities running pretty close uh we see
our 80 percent hands ninety percent
hands up being just five percent each
and we see um
significantly stronger range for the
imposition player than it was uh when we
were talking about a big blind against
utg
so now out of position we don't want to
be putting money in the bot on this
mono monoflop so we're checking and now
uh this is
where the fun begins
so as the player from the button
uh let's just exclude the flushes from
our range
and see our overall strategy
so imposition we are firing
uh pretty much
most of our no equity hands so jack nine
of hearts has nothing on this flop but
still battling
around 80 percent
uh a lot of ace highs barling a lot of
kings heist king high barling uh we'll
see some king jack you know all those
over cards king queen barling of course
they're not barreling at a full
frequency just because if we borrow at
full frequency all the offset combos we
cannot offset the
amount of value that we have or actually
the flushes that we have in position uh
when we go to the flushes we see our
flushes here from the button are not
that many you know they're just
um those mostly suited broadways a bit
more on the ace high side and some uh
8x9x
so
uh the first thing that strikes me when
i play this board
from the button
is how wide are we going to prop the
flop and then let's see the response
against against this uh
against this stop
now the response out of position needs
to have around 17
check raise and why is that of course
because he checked almost his whole
range on the flop and now he has a lot
of hands that need to put more money
than just 20 percent uh so pocket races
will spade pocket kings with a spade
check raising almost full frequency as
we go lower we will see you know the
nine stance check raising
a bit less
just because of how many flushes they
are blocking so you know the atex is
blocking
less the less flushes than the ace of
spades of course
and the old uh
my my favorite you know old saying
strong had hand put money into the pot
so um is aces with a spade check raising
asus without spray check raising
now the first thing about uh this flop
you know the white stop and
uh when button stops uh not only that
low jack in practice is not check
raising those you know as um you know
probably pocket tense to such frequency
because they already better on the flop
out of position because easier to play
but also those jack 10
queen 10 you know queen jack with one
spade
all those um hands you know that are
very tough to play as a check race
because when we check race let's say
queen 10 10 of spades and turn comes a
spade again the question comes are we
strong enough what are we doing are we
betting are we checking to um you know
bluff catch what what bluff does he have
so this is one thing uh out of position
player check raising a lot less which
allows us to be stabbing flop even more
and another thing is
how wide the out of position player
needs to be defending this flop against
the
the 20 stop just to reach the minimum
defense frequency and you can see
age jack without the spade uh ace 10
without a spade ace queen ace king all
those hands are check calling the flop
to almost full frequency
we'll see some king jack even without a
spade king queen quite a lot of king
queens without special calling the flop
so this is uh about how to play button
now let's see how to play from the low
jack
uh so we check the flop
and now um
flop goes check check
flop goes check check
turn comes uh yeah it's tiago so we'll
uh i'll come back to to
population tendencies
in this spot now
um
turn comes another spade and now the
board is for spades so we're thinking uh
what should we do
with our king queen without spade uh
what should we do with all those you
know queen nine of hearts what are we
doing with uh um
ace four of diamonds
now there are two options here first
option is bad big on the turn and try to
get immediate fold equity uh try to get
immediate immediate faults
so uh betting with the big size
we see that uh button needs to be
defending quite a lot of uh you know one
pair hands such as jackax that he didn't
uh bet the flop with it
he needs to be defending a little bit of
ace queen without a spade even just to
defend his range he needs to be
defending a lot of pocket players uh
without without a spade you know the
higher ones not so much because they're
blocking bluffs but the low the low ones
you know the force a little bit the five
the fives a little bit
and now uh this is one option you know
if if
it's easier
or you just bet the turn big and then
give up the river because we isolated
ourselves against a strong range but i'd
suggest doing another thing
now out of position uh from the low jack
we can go for 20 and we see that
actually uh the preferred sizing here is
20
uh it could be 25 it could be 30
it doesn't really change that much in
practice but let's say the small the
small size so we're betting 20 on the
turn
uh we see now quite a lot of one pair
hands need to be defending in position
so we're keeping the range of imposition
player a lot wider now as we bet with
the small size so actually every 9 8
every ace queen needs to be defending
7x 6x that that they have they're
defending i think against the 20
will see still overfolding but we'll see
a wide enough range that we can barrel
off on the river
so river comes a blank
doesn't really change much but i just
like the three hearts on the river so
river comes a blank and now uh all those
hands that we started bluffing on the
turn so all those quintens uh king tents
without equity we can profitably borrow
on the river because of how wide the
other position range is you know 9 8 10
8 10 9
and now when we go for the
for the big size
so this one is around
two thirds spot
uh what do we see we still see jackade
um so jackax needs to call with a high
frequency we see um you know uh pretty
much every flush needs to need to call
against the big size on the river and
it's just uh very hard uh to happen in
practice because imagine this spot we go
check check on the flop as the other
position player we have all the flushes
we have you know a lot of asex king x
even queen exo spades and then on the
turn it comes jack of spades we are
betting
button cause on the river we still have
all those strong flashes and we're going
for a big bet well it is going to be
very hard for the player in position uh
to go enough with his uh one pair hands
and even with his flushes facing the big
bed here
and not only this but also the amount of
bluff raising here will be zero
because
people
just don't like to be raising into a
range that has some not advanced so as
the other position player we have quite
a lot of asex of spades here and nobody
has the boss really to be bluffing this
imposition
uh now about thiago's question first of
all
we spoke about how do we play from the
button population under bluffs flop as
the button so our exploit will be to
overstep if we're at you know in buttons
shoes
then on the turn population under bluffs
the turn and
overflows against the turning bad from
the bottom so as low jack people will
not be finding the 20
bet on the turn enough and because
they're not finding it they will not
find the cause against you when you bet
there so our exploit here will be
overblocked turn for the small size and
then on the river as we bet 20 turn and
we kept in position range wider we can
be bluffing with a very very high
frequency having the nuts in our range
not worrying about being check raised
and uh just making a lot of you know one
pair of hands and even low and mid
flushes fault
because of how strong it is to bet when
you have that many nut hands in your
ring now enough about mono boards we're
going to jump into one of my favorite
spots it's the straight completing
boards this time we are playing cut off
against the big blind ace queen 10. so
uh on this board
uh 50 bits deep
we don't want to be using the range bet
small size strategy here
why is that
does anybody have an explanation here
why are we not betting the flop with
small signs for range bed we have the
nut advantage this is true our range has
66 percent equity this is
also true
we need to charge draws another big
argument here so all those are
valid arguments deeper spr means that we
want to be
getting as much money as we can by the
river with our nutted hands
and of course getting as much fold
equity with our bluffs now we are from
the cutoff and here we we we're playing
quite a wide range but still betting for
for 100 frequency
now the preferred sizing is around 55
and why is that it is because this is
the perfect size to uh make jackax good
shots and king x girl shots uh with the
back door um indifferent or close to
indifferent and it is the right size to
be folding king x and jack x and without
the back door as well as make some 10x
fold put the pressure on bottom and
middle pair so 10x and queen x
now um what happens uh
here uh in terms of check raises we see
big blind check raising decent amount on
this flop uh it is not of course not so
much it's around uh seven percent but in
practice this is often played as a zero
check raise
even even from high stakes rags when
they face high half pot here um they
very hard
they they find bluffs
it's just very hard for them to find
bluffs as check races and that's why
they just don't check raise their value
hands in gto
uh we are check raising
uh the low uh gunshots we prefer those
jack 3 jack 4 so that we're unblocking a
bigger part of the bed folding
range of the cutoff
and for uh for the value
we are check raising some frequency of
king jack of course keeping the other
king jack in our range to be to have
some strong hands on the turn otherwise
you know it will be easier to
uh to borrow from the cut off and then
check raising quite a lot of age jack to
charge those weaker ace highs though
pairs and gut shots and then ace 10
for the two pair a little bit of ace 9
and s we go
down we're just purely calling call
those asex hands i know most of the
queen x hands and 10x with the backdoor
so in practice uh we'll see prob is
close to zero check race so how how does
this change the turn when the uh jack
comes or king comes
now there is only one card uh
needed for a straight so in this case it
is king
and because we have so many king x uh
from the cutoff
uh we can
continue borrowing
uh a lot of hands that have absolutely
zero equity so six five
to
you know nine six nine seven
all those hands that
have absolutely nothing on this turn and
they're uh barling so that they can fold
out a lot of one pair hands and we of
course have uh you know those threes
fours five six sevens uh true nines uh
barling the turn and this is because uh
those are the hands that can
that are just very good bluffs because
they're unblocking you know uh his uh
faults and also um they can improve to
the best hand if our opponent has you
know two pair we can uh we can win by
hitting our four on the river
now uh we see uh quite a lot of 10x
being turned into a bluff
and then queen x and asex checking back
mostly now when we use again the half
bot sizing
[Music]
we see something that again never
happens in practice and what is that
check raising
uh straight from the big blind
nobody's check raising straight from the
big blind here because
uh it is
very very hard to find bluffs
and people just think that when they
check race they're straight on the turn
their hand is being turned face up and
this is true of course when nobody can
find the bluff on this ace queen 10 jack
run out uh why would you be check
raising this uh king
king x
straight when you can just check call
and get evie from letting your opponent
borrow the river
uh so
on the turn uh big blind needs to be
defending
um a lot of asex starts folding some
asex and then every two pair of course
that get check caught on the turn so uh
queen 10 a stan is actually being turned
into a bluff because of how many
straights is blocking
um but of course nobody finding that in
practice and now
think about the river when we go to the
river in gto big blind doesn't have that
many straights but in practice if people
are check calling these traits
and their check folding asex here to a
higher frequency which will happen very
very often this means that their range
on the river is significantly stronger
has significantly more straights
as a part of the whole range then gto
so when big blind
calls here river comes use
now we see uh imposition uh barling the
bluffs that are blocking this uh king x
so mostly 10x
mostly
jack x as bluffs of course some
frequency of those slow uh you know
force trees five fours just because of
the fact that we don't have enough
jackax and 10x those are only suited
combos or those are only
three combos each then of course against
this big size
uh big blind needs to be defending
mostly king x
and uh and then a little bit of you know
asex
a little bit of quinten but these are
not that many combos and in practice if
out of position has all those king x
hands on the river and they have
significantly less
asex on the river
this will mean
that
we should wave the white flag at this
point
and
the the highest ev
on this board will be
uh the bet bet check line
so let's just summarize this one
so cut off against a big blind 50 big
blinds ace queen 10. first of all from
the big blind people are not check
raising this flop so if they're not
check raising this flop from the cutoff
they're not calling enough against the
check race and i want to demonstrate
this in in our example so on the flop
cutoff bets 55 percent
we're check raising
and now cut off needs to be defending
queen x
with the
with the back door needs to be defending
almost every asex there it doesn't
matter has a gunshot or a back door you
know a7 is just a pure pure defense
against czech race
uh needs to be defending
even some uh 10x with the backdoor uh
quite a lot of you know jackax quite a
lot of king x with the back door
so the first exploit here that we are
going to do in practice is to be
check raising this flop at a higher
frequency because because the cutoff
will be over folding so we're applying
the same logic here people never check
raise this flop as a bluff
so they always fall against the check
rays so we're going to counter this by
check raising this flop a lot so that we
get immediate faults with our jackax
with our king x from those asex hands
with
from those one pair hands that the
cutoff is supposed to continue it now
the second one population is under
bluffing the turn as cut off like they
uh don't find enough low pocket pairs
they don't find enough eight heights not
high 10 hijack high to bluff the river
and uh
that's why
when they're getting borrowed so when
when somebody borrows against the big
blind here big blind overfalls on the
turn and of course under check raises
those straights on the turn which means
that you know those two assumptions that
we have
leave big blinds range uh significantly
stronger on the river so we should be
very very picky with our bluffs in
position i'd suggest we just bet that
check
but then if you think your opponent is a
better player you know successful
mistakes or high stakes player then he's
defending the big blind against turn
barrel then we have to be very precise
with our bluffs on the river so bluffing
jackax bluffing 10x you know those pairs
that are blocking the majority of the
streets uh you know that are blocking
the straits from the big blind so be
careful here when we bet bet to not be
just blasting money on the river with uh
eight six of hearts uh because the big
blind people have a lot of straights and
we'll just be losing money with this
river barrel now the spot that um i
think is uh easiest to nail by most
players this is the locked boards spot
so jack jack six for example now we are
playing hijack against big blind with 30
big blinds of course we are uh betting
this flop with a very very high
frequency with the smaller sizing in
fact i'm often just
bearing one big blind uh
on this flop with my whole range as it
is just so easy to execute and also it
is so easy for big blind to be over
folding now let's look how does the big
blind
react against the
small percent range back first of all we
see a lot of check raising what is the
reason for uh check raising here in
theory from the big blind what is the
reason for check raising with such a
high frequency you see
check raising 21
check calling 22 23
so we're check raising as much as we're
check calling and we're just folding the
rest can you find me one good reason
why do we want to be check raising from
the big blind
against the range bat deny equity rafa's
guess
i like it somebody else all right we
have um
we have more jackax
uh
let's look at that we actually do have
more jackax
as a number of combos but but as as part
of our whole range we still see
that
the hijack has higher
frequency of uh you know 70 80 90 hands
just because of how white the out of
position range is here we see those uh
jack x combos being 12
of hijack range and just eight percent
of the big blind range
so
yes we need to prevent imposition from
running us over this is a very good
argument that i think um
answers the question to a big part as
well as denying equity uh which are of
course related so uh when we check code
the flop
we are uh allowing our opponent to
realize his equity in position and to be
barreling turns and rivers
and this is uh
why
we check raise very high
uh frequency our 6x
from the big blind just because this 6x
can can can get in a very tough spot if
we check coal and then hijack biostern
and river you know on some runouts it
will be very hard to call down with the
6x while if we check race
if we check raise the 6x we will be
making money against all those you know
ace high floats
king high flows uh backdoor straight
back doors uh flush floats so 6x needs
to be check raising the flop here the
high frequency of course
uh quite a lot of jackax uh check
raising the flop here we see
majority of our jackax check raising the
flop
and then we see uh quite a lot of uh
backdoor straights backdoor flushes uh
check raising from the big blind uh we
see those you know ace three back doors
ace deuce back doors those targeting you
know the higher aces to fall by the
river especially if they get a good turn
so um the first thing
that uh makes an impression here is that
of course people are not check raising
as much from the big blind
so when they face one big blind here i
think it is just much easier to uh call
this uh hands-like
queen king queen hence like you know a
stan with the back door or even without
doesn't matter you know it's just much
easier to call these uh ace highs these
um
broadway
hands that have the back door straight
that have decent equity uh you know
against pocket pairs against ace highs
and i think in practice people are just
check calling the flop with uh with
those hands uh at
almost uh a 100 frequency
uh check calling uh quite a lot uh
more 6x so yes people learn to check
raise the flop with 6x but still not
doing it with such a high frequency
and of course those uh you know nine
highs or seven highs
uh eight highs are either check raises
or
check faults so
having those things in mind uh we are
arriving on the turn
and big blind's range is significantly
uh different from
gto first of all uh
from the big blind it's very easy to
find the value check raises in terms of
jackpacks so
from the big blind to just uh very easy
to be check raising the g
yes yes tiago
uh uh it's very easy to be check raising
the term with jackax but not so easy to
check raise the turn with let's say a7
it's just not
very intuitive you know it's hard to
find it's hard to have the intuition to
check race a7 of diamonds on this flop
to not get to run over or to not get
borrowed on future streets
so
there is a question about how do we play
the turn when we check race
and we have a six first of all
uh the first thing that uh that we see
against the czech race big blind is
folding just 25 percent of the time
and this is mostly offsuite hands that
did not uh
connect with the board that much so all
the backdoor all the backdoor
combinations
uh backdoor flush combinations uh
continuing on the flop uh except for
some you know lower a6 which are
blocking the blocks themselves so first
of all we are printing money by check
raising this flop just because of how
how the hijack will be overfolding uh
the flop
you know not being able to
to defend against check race with let's
say
9 7
100 the time you know re-raising or
calling doesn't matter nobody is
defending such high frequency 97. now
when we call
and the river comes a low car this is to
answer the question about 6x we'll see
uh quite a lot of 6x continuing for a
small size
uh this is to deny equity of all those
uh floats all those um
king highs
all those queen highs all those you know
10 9
highs you know these ace highs as well
as make money against the ace highest
now how do we approach on a high card
this is a good question
let's say it comes a king
turns turn comes the king and we're
checking
all the
the 6x so
now it is logical here
that because most of uh
hijacked floats come from king x queen
next asac a6 hands we'll be checking the
turn with a six
and now
when we check
uh imposition player wants to be betting
with a small size
first of all to fold out uh big blinds
auto folds so bluffs like
nine seven for example that check raise
the flop or seven four with the back
door uh they just don't need more than a
quarter potter or third pot uh to be
folding i i'll be playing the quarter
pot here actually
um and i think it's um
it's better in practice it's just enough
for people to be
folding their autofoads
and also we want to be betting
white so we want to be betting for value
with our
you know
[Music]
king x especially the the strong ones i
want to be betting 10x i want to be
betting uh excuse me 10th and 9th but
this differs a lot in practice because
look at that why is hijack not betting
poke or pocket nines or pocket queens
with a high frequency here so why hijack
is not betting pocket tents or pocket
knives here this is certainly a strong
hand to bet like it's strong enough uh
6x
yes part the part the reason is
turn check raises actually
the whole reason is turn check raises
let's look at that
now
betting for third part and we see 11
check raising
so 6x is just check calling uh
on high cards um
you know letting those queen 10 queen 9
10 9
barrel off
we need to be calling this six uh 6x
because otherwise we'll be uh
uh we will be folding you know one of
the
strong hands in our range but also when
we are on the high hijack when we bet
for 33
will not get check raised with such high
frequency so
here on the turn
overall strategy of the big blind high
card we need to check the hijack usually
bets
and then we can be check raising those
trips so we are going for
for a double check race
in practice this never happens and spot
plays uh straightforward just uh
you know big blind batting his jackax
betting his uh you know turned um draws
and check for a check calling 6x and
almost never check raising the turn in
practice
now
how much do you think the feel slow
plays the jackax so if we start from
from the flop we are always thinking uh
not in absolute terms but in relative
terms
so in relative terms jack x is check
raising the flop in practice at a higher
frequency
because
bluffs are hard to find out of position
you know those
queen 10 of kingdom off you just don't
find them that uh that often
uh and then
because people are not
don't have enough check race bluffs
and it is easy to find the check race
with the jack i think on the turn jack x
uh
is a higher percent of of population
populations range
than gto range
then on the river on on the turn when it
comes let's say
a king x but regardless on the turn i
don't think people learn to be double
check raising this
this texture or to be checking
jackax at all on the turn
so they're just firing with their
jackets they're firing with their uh
turn draws so for example
uh it will be you know 10 9 here it'll
be queen 10 here
and then um
uh betting you know the the
jackax as well as um
missing of course those uh low five
highs uh
actually
the flush draws might be there but the
other ones you know the diamonds will
definitely not be there
now uh let's go back to to
to borrowing here without equity so the
turn comes
uh so hijacker
hijack betting small size big blind
check calling and then turn comes four
of hearts so pretty much a blank turn
let's see uh the beauty of of the game
here
so because of how many jackax
big blind check raced on the flop
we get to be balling our
no equity hands with a very high
frequency here so
if we see the 97 it's not only the
hearts it's also the space diamonds and
the clubs barring with a very high
frequency uh it's not only queen seven
hearts it's all other combos and
uh when we go to the offshoot combos we
will see you know those uh king heist um
and queen heist bar link with a very
high frequency should be targeting the
ace highs of the opposition player and
because against the big blind needs to
be defending a lot of ace highs here on
the turn
uh uh that will be hard to defend i
think those turn
uh barrels will have even higher ev
so we see the
the the king 10
of course heart with a hard
blocker will have higher d so higher
frequency of barling but even without
the heart i think if we not lock
for the big blind check calling more the
flop
with uh
you know the king high screen highs
check raising more of his jackax then
will get a very very profitable turn
barrel with those uh
no equity hands
and now of course
when it comes down to the sizing
uh sql uh implies we can find uh
we can find uh
enough fold equity with the smaller size
but
i'm thinking if we're targeting
the ace heights of the other position
player we want to be betting
bigger here so it's easier to to fold
out
if we are targeting uh you know um his
ace highs by the river then we are
betting smaller on the turn letting him
go with ace high and then barling the
river
folding out his ace highs and 6 and 6x
and now we see
on let's say
uh
blank river
now we see um
those uh
108s you know 10 highs non-highs they're
battling the river with a very high
frequency in theory and uh when they bet
we see that they're making uh 6x
indifferent but also big blind needs to
be calling the strongest 6x so ace
six king six because of the blockers
that they're blocking asia king jack
combos as well as six five six four six
three because they're unblocking the
bluff combos because they're unblocking
10 9 they're unblocking 1080 i'm
blocking 10 7.
[Music]
so
going back to the conclusions for for
this spot we're talking about jack jack
six uh big blind against hijack first of
all population check raises value heavy
so they are check raising more jackax
they are check raising less bluffs and
of course we follow this logic when they
face check race from the hijack against
the big line they are over
the check race because
they are not check raising enough bluffs
themselves so as an exploit here i think
um check raising 6x on the flop check
raising code those bluffs work very very
well from the big blind just because of
how hard it is uh for the imposition
player to be defending 70 percent 75
percent of his range
against a check race and then on the
term population definitely under bluffs
so does not borrow with those uh
king highs queen highs 10 9 7 high
no equity hands so because they're not
over bluffing the turn from the hijack
they are over folding against the turn
barrel from the big blind and then on
the river of course when population bets
the flop and bets the turn
they are expecting that the big blind
continued with a very very strong range
probably
6x being the weakest part of the range
and when somebody bets for triple barrel
it is just hard to find bluffs so people
are bluffing flop bluffing turn
and then
uh most of the time checking the river
because of how strong the big blind
range already is and now what can we do
first of all as i said check raise flop
from the big blind over bluff the turn
from the hijacker as the pre-fall
progressor and over bluff the river as
the pre-fall progresser
because people will not be able to find
those river bluffs themselves so they
will think you didn't find them and they
will be having very hard time to be
calling those a6 or king six six four
six three six deuce so at the end of
this lecture i'd like to make uh you
know a conclusion and it is a very very
practical one because i i saw during the
series a lot of people you know uh blind
blindly following theory analyzing hands
just seeing people giving argumentation
because the solver does that but this is
not enough of an argument to be making
decisions out of it
so if the solver does that this does not
mean this is the best play in practice
and i know you already know that
everybody knows that but it's just a bit
hard to be executing this when you're
playing 10 tables after you know two
weeks of series going on so while
playing and while betting on certain
street
always think about
how is the population perceiving your
bet so how is the population playing in
your shoes and then deriving from this
logic the best play
so if the population is not check
raising on
queen six deuce three spades it's not
check raising bottom pair middle pair
middle flush draws
then they will not be defending against
a check race as the pre-fall progressor
so we always need to be countering the
the perception of the population right
if population perceives that we don't
have a bluff in this spot then we need
to be having
more bluffs in this spot
because people will be overfalling
right uh for example if the board is
spared jack jack six and we are betting
flow but in turn coming to the river and
people don't think that we that they
they don't find the bloods themselves on
the river with those air like queen 10
king 10 or 10 9 then they will not be
able to defend 6x on the river as we saw
in the last example and now deviating
accordingly so uh not following gto on
when
it's you know i i find people following
gto whenever it's uh easy for them to
follow
so
if it's easy if it's logical they follow
it if it's not logical so if it's not
easy to lead the turn on a fourth flush
if it's not easy to lead let's say when
the board pairs twice on the turn they
just don't do it because it's just a
very complicated part of the game three
that it's hard to execute so if people
deviate from gto we need to be deviating
accordingly so we need to be exploiting
that and sometimes it is by waving the
white flag so on the straight completing
board example if you remember on the
turn big blind was check raising his
trades you know big majority of the
straights which allows for the prefab
aggressor to be battling the river
aggressively
against a range that does not have that
many straights and that have more
one-pair hands and two pair hands
then if this is our assumption then we
just betting flop but in turn
checking the river last thing that i
want to put emphasis on is about
experimenting so a lot of players that
i've worked with are just thinking about
how will their play look like
so oh
i would look stupid calling this on the
river oh i will look stupid betting a
random hand on the turn because it's not
gto people would think i'm weak you know
i'm playing with you know high stakes
rex here i don't want to be to have bad
reputation in their eyes and all
nonsense arguments like that
i think the best in the game became so
good by experimenting and by making
mistakes and by having the bose to go
for a boat play to go for a you know
eccentric play
following their gut and their intuition
because it's all about how do you
perceive
the spot how how does your opponent
think about your range it's not what
what your range looks looks like it's
it's impossible to know what your range
looks like on ten tables but it's not so
hard to figure out what your opponent is
thinking about your play or about your
line because these are population
tendencies that come across many many
different spots uh that deviate a lot
from the solvers so you have all my
support to be making uh eccentrics place
even at the risk of ruining your
reputation and making mistakes just
because this is the only way to find
different place to find place that are
not understood by
the population and to be maximizing your
ev
blindly following the silver
uh will never yield a very high ev so uh
that was uh it for the barling without
equity now
i like to
leave some time for discussion
if you guys have any questions or if we
had some questions unanswered because i
saw you guys asking a lot of questions i
couldn't answer all of them trying to go
over all of our examples here we will
definitely punch a little bit more after
yeah i hope so i hope so because even if
you punch some spot know that 10 other
spots people will be overfalling against
your aggression so those funds will be
justified my friend if there are no
further questions thank you so much
about your time and attention about the
fact that you actively participated and
helped me lead this session and i hope
it was productive for you because it was
productive for me as well learning some
new things while doing the work and
i'm very very
thankful for this opportunity guys
please reach out in discord if there are
any questions and see you next time
