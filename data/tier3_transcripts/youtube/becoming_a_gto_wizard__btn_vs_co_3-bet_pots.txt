### TOPIC: btn vs co 3-bet pots
[Music] hey guys I'm excited to introduce our 
latest GTO wizard Pro the legendary Joey Ingram in  
this video Joey and I study button versus cut off 
three bet pot strategies in cash games we hope you
[Music] enjoy all right what's up guys I'm Joey 
Ingram and uh welcome to a journey that I'm taking  
down the two card poin Omaha rabbit hole and 
a lot of people out there know me for for card  
for PLO but a few people know that I actually 
played millions of hands of hold them before I  
got into the beautiful great game of mon Omaha and 
recently once I started watching the live streams  
and seeing hold them start to make a rise and high 
stakes make a comeback and I started to see how  
these players played I uh started developing more 
of a passion for Learning holdom and um along the  
way GTO wizard trainer and their program has 
been one of my main tools I've used and I've  
loved their content and especially this guy I'm 
collaborating with today I'm sure you guys have  
loved his content too if you've seen it some 
of his stuff really blow me away as I've been  
learning holdom so we've done a few lessons 
before this and we're going to do an official  
Series where me and T boss 21 here are going to go 
down the rabbit hole and uh yeah man it's going to  
be a pleasure I appreciate you uh you collabing 
with me and you and uh I'm ready man I'm ready  
to I'm ready for whatever kind of Wizardry you 
got to teach me buddy absolutely and Joey I am  
so psyched to have you on I think this is going to 
be a really fun series you bring up great energy  
to this I really admire your enthusiasm and 
dedication as he said we're going to be stating  
Mr Joey Ingram's Journey Through the technical 
game of no limit hold them and we're going to  
be studying spots one at a time starting with the 
button now just prior to this call Joey was making  
a point that you have to be a God on the button 
and the reason is if you just look at theoretical  
win rates by position the button accounts for a 
huge huge portion of your win rate and that's true  
regardless of whether or not you play micros 
Stakes or high stakes the button matters and  
so nailing these spots nailing spots for you're 
playing the button is going to be crucial to your  
long-term win rate and we can see here that in 
a no- ra game the expected value or the win rate  
of the button is about 25 big blinds per 100 and 
trust me you'll need that to make up for the eeve  
loss of playing in the blinds now studying earlier 
positions and such mle position that's useful too  
but you have to pick the low hanging fruit first 
and that's why we're starting here now in today's  
video we're going to be covering button versus 
cut off three bet pots so we're talking about  
spots where cut off opens button three bets cut 
off calls they check to us in position and now we  
take a flop Joey I suppose maybe you could start 
me off by telling me a little bit about how you  
think about this spot now that you've been putting 
in so much study time yeah I mean you know I'm  
kind of converting over from this heads up mindset 
and as people know I mean not a lot of people play  
heads up but heads up you're playing 80 some per 
of your hands pre- flop on the button and you know  
so I'm trying to say how do I play as many hands 
as possible on the button how do I go crazy and  
I've had to really re myself in so now that I've 
been reing myself in and not three betting every  
single King ex suited not three betting every sort 
of suited you know 85 eight I've always wanted  
three bet all these hands to me they make sense 
as natural three bets and they still really you  
know if I'm going to open up my threshold at three 
betting I'm going to start including some of those  
hands especially against a lot of weaker players 
but I think right now I'm trying to get a really  
understanding of just you know sort of visually 
how the hand is going to work across three streets  
and how I can just set up a really rock solid 
pre flop default flop strategy so I'm finding  
that you really can't go wrong betting a third and 
then you have these couple different structures  
where there's basically two types of structures 
where one structure you're betting small on one  
structure you can bet bigger on you know like the 
3 three fours and the the de duu F and stuff like  
that these low boards where you're just going to 
have a bigger overpair Advantage so you can kind  
of go crazy with those Ace so I'm trying to find 
that threshold with the with the ace Queens what  
are the combos I Barrel why am I barreling them 
you know sort of like build out this deeper level  
understanding of why I can automatically bet a 
third on you know any mono board and all these  
AI boards all these King High boards these Queen 
High boards you can just basically you're printing  
betting a third you know yeah I'm basically trying 
to take it to that next level the turn and the  
river and try to get it more better understanding 
of that I guess you could say yeah absolutely  
and so I think any part of building a strategy is 
starting from the big picture strategies first and  
then slowly building down to the more the smaller 
parts of the game tree if you will and so one  
of the best ways to start is by examining these 
aggregate reports what these reports do is they  
show the aggregate strategy across all possible 
flops there's 1,755 strategically distinct flops  
22,100 unique flops and so there's a lot of 
different flops how do we kind of simplify this  
and start building a strategy from all of this 
data right I think one of the very first steps  
to do is to just figure out what type of boards 
you want to have a big bet strategy a small bet  
strategy and what type of flops you mainly want 
to play defense on right so what I'm going to  
do is I'm going to group this by high card and 
let's just take a look at some trends that we can  
infer here so what this is showing us is that for 
example on Jack High boards you almost always want  
a bet in a button versus cut off three bet pot 
but on something like a seven High board you're  
checking back half the time here so we want to try 
and develop these thresholds so Jack for example  
almost always going to be a bet low cards we're 
mixing big bets but lots of checks and so I guess  
before we just start roote memorizing this stuff 
we should maybe ask why is it that we want to bet  
more often on these big cards and less often but 
with a larger sizing on these low card flops what  
do you think Joey pretty much range Advantage so 
you're going to have more Aces More Kings more  
Queens more Jacks more tens and they're going to 
be for betting Aces pure theoretically right Aces  
pure Kings pure Queens P pure even like their best 
Ace King suited they're going to be orbiting those  
pure as well so I feel like you can uh you know 
you know maybe as as simple as you can put in yeah  
exactly so it all comes down to the difference 
between the ranges and so what I've done here is  
I've opened up the ranges Tab and I've filtered 
for the call so this is really useful because it  
kind of gives you an idea of who's going to have 
the advantage on different boards right and in  
particular we'll note that these King High aside 
flops are going to be great for the aggressor no  
surprise there Queen high is about the bottom of 
the cut offs calling range offit calling range and  
the reason I always pay attention to the offsuit 
calling range is because even though these look  
smaller like Ace Queen off accounts for many 
more combinations than Ace Queen suited so one  
technique that I like to start with for just 
developing a sense of how I should categorize  
flops is to look at a range breakdown so what I 
do is I say I copy these ranges into some software  
and then I just use card removal to figure out who 
has the advantage or who has more of what type of  
card by rank so that's how I make these charts 
here so what this does is what is this yeah yeah  
so this is a a little private analysis technique I 
like to use so basically I just type in the number  
of combinations of cards and then I take a little 
side by side and a difference thing and so what  
this shows on the left hand side is that generally 
speaking cut off is going to have more of the 2x  
3x 4X 5x all the way up to about 9x and button 
in position as the pre- Flop aggressor will of  
course have more jackx Queen X King X and acex and 
so by just starting with this card distribution  
difference we can already find a nice Line in the 
Sand and that is the 10 if the Flop is above a 10  
you're typically going to be betting often for a 
small size because you have a big range Advantage  
if the Flop is less than a 10 you can no longer 
range bet and you need to start considering a more  
polarized strategy you can also take a look at a 
side by-side view again we have cut off and button  
and if we take a look at where this threshold is 
this 10x and just compare that with the aggregate  
reports over here we can see that the trend 
follows very clearly flops that are greater than a  
10 high frequency bet pushing your range Advantage 
flops that are lower than a 10 low frequency bet  
about half the time and these darker squares 
indicate that we're using larger bet sizes so just  
by studying aggregate reports like this I think we 
can already start to develop some heris discs can  
I ask you okay so when we have a range Advantage 
why why do they like you to bet smaller versus  
bigger that's a great question Joey often the 
reason is uh the types of hands you're interested  
in betting so for example let's take uh a low bet 
board cuz most people would think if you have Aces  
if you have Kings like I want to get max value 
I'd want to bet bigger I'd want you know that's  
I think a lot of players think about poker like 
that if they go oh I'm going to check I'm going  
to bet smaller with Ace five but I'm going to bet 
bigger with Aces because I want to get paid when  
I have a big hand so and obviously you know this 
isn't necessarily the way G wizard thinks about  
it but I think it's understanding the answer to 
that question helps you to better understand what  
the idea of balance and the idea of exploit and 
and uh you know kind of build in like a baseline  
yeah great question so on a board like king93 it's 
very dry it's disconnected your opponent's gonna  
have a hard time defending the important thing to 
realize is that the amount of money you put in on  
the Flop is not the amount of money your Aces 
will get right if you bet big on the Flop sure  
maybe you can get more money immediately but less 
money all the way by Showdown whereas by betting  
small by keeping your range wide you incentivize 
them to put in more money which is going to be  
great for the top of your range uh furthermore 
a lot of the hands in your range are going to  
benefit from Equity denial when your advantage 
is so big that you can just bet everything right  
so for example if you imagine you have a hand 
like 108 or queen 10 lots of these hands have  
some type of equity but they're definitely going 
to benefit from folding out for example all of  
these pocket pairs in the opponent's range now 
compare this to some sort of low cardboard let's  
say something like uh 9852 tone 9852 it's going 
to be very difficult to range bet and the reason  
is our opponent they still have pock pocket 9es 
they still have pocket eights they've got pocket  
fives they've got 98 they've got a bunch of draws 
they've got Ace 9 King n so we no longer have the  
nut advantage and because we don't have that nut 
Advantage we cannot just range bet everything we  
don't have that overwhelming Equity Advantage so 
in this case what you'll want to do is develop  
a checkback range start pushing your Equity with 
a more polarized range I mean I got ask ask some  
questions about that you know what I me I mean 
that's a whole other rabbit hole right and know  
I guess when you when you thing about studying 
this because to me there's such different boards  
you know I'm studying an Ace King five board it's 
going to be such a different way to think about it  
than on a 985 board to me it kind of makes sense 
to study the a high boards first because we do  
have such a range Advantage so when I'm when I'm 
thinking about this lately I've been saying you  
know why don't I focus on those AI boards because 
those are going to basically be my wheelhouse  
whereas on those boards you know 985 theoretically 
when I see B big with Kings and I get check raised  
you know if I'm 100bb like you know I'm hanging 
on tight then I got to start making some reads  
I got to decide if this is the kind of player 
who's going to be bluffing me or not and you  
know maybe you could say most people aren't going 
to be bluffing you so you can maybe get away from  
some of those hands but even then if you end up 
putting in 100 BB with overpair on 985 like you  
could say it is what it is especially if there's 
a fruster out there too so it's kind of like you  
know I'm developing you know your focus on my 
study right our focus on that so it's I find that  
something interesting to think about I'm curious 
how you kind of would approach that or you would  
recommend approaching that well I definitely 
agree with studying AI flops first and not  
just because of the way they play simply because 
they're more common what I'm showing here is the  
aggregate report for all possible flops and on the 
left hand side we see these little percentages now  
these represent the proportion of high card flops 
so 21.7% of flops are ace high 18.3% are King High  
15.2 or queen high when I show this to a lot of 
novic they get confused because isn't a queen just  
as like as an ace well yes but we're looking at 
it by high card right so Ace king queen is an AI  
flop right now given that these flops are more 
common you can get more value for your time by  
studying them compared to for example seven High 
flops which are far less common basic principle of  
my teaching method is to focus on things that are 
going to be have a bigger impact on your win rate  
immediately and one of those would be taking into 
account the frequency of the type of textures you  
like to create now speaking of textures Joey let 
me ask this is a crazy this is this is a really  
interesting screen because this is I've never seen 
this screen before yeah I mean it kind of It kind  
of ties in with the you know with kind of your 
predicted EV and it even shows you you know why  
like you it's just way to see the BET sizes right 
because you can see 75% you know there's a drop  
off there six and Below you are betting that big 
size pretty often and then once once it gets above  
a six you're really not betting that size often at 
all right you're kind of going more half pot so I  
find that kind of fascinating where on that seven 
to 10 it's more half pot as you get past the 10  
you start going really small right so you can kind 
of see the progression from the 20 to the 75 and  
then you know that that part to me really stands 
out the bigger the smaller the smaller the bigger  
yeah exactly and I think uh just looking at this 
section here as you were pointing out you can see  
a very very common Trend where these cardboards 
you're checking a lot but you're also betting  
bigger big sizes and then at these high cardboards 
you're checking rarely but you're betting smaller  
and this is a a typical Trend you'll see in Holdem 
GTO strategies is that there's a rule of thumb  
not like a hard law of Game Theory but generally 
speaking when you want to bet most of your range  
you want to bet small because you've got a lot 
of mergy hands in there and when you're forced  
to develop a significant checkback range you'll 
want it bet bigger in this case it also happens  
that on for example nine high and Below boards 
part of the reason a larger more geometric sized  
bet is preferred is because the value of fold 
Equity is higher so for example if we bet half  
pot on 985 with let's say you have ace9 here or 
Jack n or queen n or something uh there's a lot of  
value to folding out these overcards the nine even 
though those hands are technically behind a top  
pair for example folding out that Equity has a lot 
of value now if you compare this to for example an  
AI flop let's say you bet top pair here Ace Queen 
Ace 10 something like that for like a medium size  
uh well congratulations you're folding out a lot 
of hands that you already dominated like Ace Queen  
is not thrilled to be folding out king Jack or 
king queen or queen Jack so you have to think  
about not just range and not Advantage but the 
value of fold Equity as I call it the the value  
of denying Equity given what the top of your range 
wants now that said I do want to just show you one  
more technique that I use for studying aggregate 
reports uh because I think once you've got your  
game planed down it's going to be easier to 
focus on follow through I recommend keeping  
this relatively simple break take some sort of 
spot like this so here we're looking at again  
cut off versus button three bed pod break it down 
into something like four to eight different types  
of boards however many you feel that you should 
be studying and these types of boards should be  
somewhat canonical meaning like monotone paired 
uh dry disconnected high card stuff like that  
and then study and practice those types of flops 
separately now for example uh if we the way I like  
to just learn about these textures is by going to 
the aggregate reports and just applying filters  
until I find strategically similar spots so we 
have all the low flops High flops now one thing  
I've noticed is that in particular disconnected 
rainbow flops are almost always going to be a bet  
and so what I do is I just pick some filters here 
and then I take a look at the aggregate betting  
frequencies here and we can see that the vast 
majority of these flops are just going to be range  
bets usually for a small size if it's a lower 
board then even more for a medium size so that'  
be for me one type of category of flop rainbow dis 
disconnected another one that I would choose would  
perhaps be ace through jack High uh unpaired not 
monotone we've seen before with that chart that  
typically the through Jacky again are going to be 
the boards you bet the most and again we can see  
that these boards are typically range bets right 
surprisingly the boards where you might choose  
not to range B are Ace wheel wheel boards so these 
are boards that have some potential wheel straight  
draw and in particular like if you look at Ace 
54 there's not a ton of incentive to generate  
fold equity on these types of flops because you as 
the button don't really have much second and third  
pair like you don't have a whole lot 5x or 4X 
so your incentive to kind of go for like a small  
mergy bet is reduced and you're not folding out 
any overcards because there are no overcards so  
there's not a lot of incentive to um deny Equity 
either for that reason sometimes the amount you  
bet isn't just about the strength of your range 
because for sure button has an advantage on as54  
sometimes it's about the incentives to deny 
Equity as well and the incentives to to bet  
with more middling strength hands if you compare 
that to something like uh Ace 104 Ace 104 we have  
a lot of 10x that would happily get some money in 
we have enough of an advantage that we don't need  
to be too worried about facing aggressive check 
raises and again we can see that the cut off  
where it goes from like betting half the time to 
betting a lot is again around the 10 as we noted  
earlier the critical threshold card if you will 
right the 10 the 10 is very the very it is the  
threshold here it's pretty interesting to see that 
yeah once you get to the nine you're just checking  
a lot more yeah and we'll we'll notice the the 
same pattern on a lot of other spots too so here's  
Queen 8X Queen 9x Queen and then boom Queen 10x it 
shoots up right because all of a sudden we start  
having a lot of 10x relative to cut off and I I'll 
mention that the the critical threshold card tends  
to change depending on spots you study in this 
spot usually it's going to be around there and  
then of course we have paired boards so this would 
be like another major canonical type of texture  
again you want to bet often on paired boards but 
the main thing to focus on with paired boards is  
not whether or not it's paired but where the 
pair is so if we go down here we can see that  
for example seven do du 633 8 D this all of these 
cards where the pair is a low card that you know  
a spot basically where we can't represent many 
trips but those are the types of par cards where  
you don't want to range bets anymore and it's 
often going to be better to start polarizing wow  
interesting I would I would think on like five new 
du you could you'd want to be just betting all the  
time in position because you have such a big range 
Advantage I mean I guess because I mean you're not  
going to have trips but at the same time I don't 
you know they have a Duce but they're going to  
fold a du sometimes too so they don't necessarily 
have the trips as well you know they're they're  
going to have more fives because fives is pure 
pre- flop but and you probably won't have fives  
you're probably not three bitting fives so I would 
just imagine that you would just bet bigger hair  
so that's pretty surprising to see that it does 
like to five de duu no one really has any trips uh  
but I will say that at some point the pocket pair 
categories start to count for more like in this  
case they still have a lot of overcards or over 
Pairs and that definitely counts towards something  
here but we'll also notice that the button often 
likes to size up and so a lot of people will look  
at something you know I'll even get rid of the the 
flush draw make that like five clubs or something  
people will look at this and say oh this is a very 
very dry texture but I think one of the problems  
with a small bet here is that it's just not super 
effective like look at the hands you're folding  
out Queen Jack Queen 10 Jack 10 like the types 
of hands you fold with a small bet here aren't  
really the types of hands you want to be folding 
so what what the solver likes to do instead is it  
likes to start targeting some of the pocket pairs 
like a 75% size here some of the ace high King  
High he wants to start targeting these hands for 
indifference so we can see like for example here  
40% of the time we're going with this big size 75% 
is Big at the SS spr it's weird because in single  
raise pots typically you see paired board small 
bet but in three bet pots paired boards often  
means bigger bet because the idea is to challenge 
these pocket pairs if not on this straight then  
on following Straits and the 20 20% bet I mean 
they're folding hands that are so that like like  
when you bet 20% and they're folding some of these 
hands here 10 n these are worse than your Bluffs  
it's hard to Bluff someone off a worse hand so so 
then how do you think about checking back because  
according to you know it's basically saying and 
the as the button you want to be checking back  
more on these low boards so you know it's checking 
back Aces it's checking back you know it seems  
like it's basically checking back of is high and 
I think feel like people are kind of afraid to to  
check back these spots but to be honest the way 
I look at it is that the buttons Equity tends to  
appreciate here because we benefit from most high 
card runouts are going to benefit us whereas like  
the medium card runouts would benefit the cut 
off but the medium strength runouts for example  
if we go check check we can just take a look at 
turn reports here what I'm going to do is just  
show you the the expected value of run outs for 
the button the higher this line the greater the  
expected value and so of course we're going to 
be benefited when the turn card is 10 or higher  
and the cutoff is going to be benefited when the 
turn card is nine or lower but even if the turn  
card is nine or lower the River card again be 
a high card so generally when you're in a spot  
where you have a lot of overcards and not a lot 
of maid hands relative to the Flop the reason you  
want to check back range is because first of all 
there's not a lot of incentive to fold out worse  
overcards secondly even if if you do fold out wor 
over cards sometimes it can be better to keep your  
opponent's range wide let their Equity depreciate 
like let their you know an ace run off and hurt  
their Queen high or whatever and have your hand 
appreciate and value just by letting some more  
cards run off so sometimes just being patient is 
is a it's a good weapon in poker yeah Mak that  
that makes sense yeah yeah especially because you 
know the turn the turn in the river I feel like  
that's where people start to go crazy their brain 
starts to break if you check back the Flop on five  
du duu and and uh you know they're not really 
going to know what to make of it necessarily so  
it's nice to have some some of those Aces and it 
also makes your hand seems like easier to play on  
the turn and on the river often times too because 
if they bet you can call and if they bet you can  
fold or you can call so it's kind of like it seems 
like an easy position to play as the button when  
checked and facing a turn decision too it is yeah 
it's way easier to play for example Ace King is a  
check here in my opinion because I don't gain 
anything from folding out Queen 10 Jack n like  
what do I care if these hands fold when I have 
Ace King that's not great I would rather keep  
those hands in range on the turn it becomes much 
easier to play a hand like Ace King and one of the  
techniques I like to use to do this is by taking 
a look again at the turn reports and then using  
the strategy here so here it's gone check check 
turn is any card check action on us in the button  
and here I'm just going to filter for example for 
Ace King now what this does is it shows me how I  
should play my Ace King across all turn cards on 
this flop first thing I'll notice is okay if turn  
goes check check and I hit a pair bet it right uh 
and for a big size too like we're we're playing  
for Stacks like so here's a question to you Joey 
why do you think it is that we want a bet pretty  
big on a king in fact it's over betting here like 
175 uh but on an ace it's betting bit smaller like  
75 when we have Ace King it's a good question I 
mean I guess for the the king so it likes us to  
bet a lot bigger on the king well we've already 
kind of saw from that previous report that  
it just loves a king right it barely checks back 
the king so I think that we're going to have a  
lot more Kings than they're going to have and um 
they're probably going to forbit most of their  
Ace Kings they might have king queen suited maybe 
some King Jack suited and maybe we're just going  
to have a lot more Kings in our range and we're 
also going to potentially have Aces too and we're  
going to have more pocket kings so I don't know 
something to all things to consider I guess but  
what what what do you think it is I think what 
you said is is pretty spoton uh we're definitely  
going to have an advantage on ASX and kingx turn 
cards uh and I think one of the the main things is  
that on a kingx turn card a lot of our for example 
king queen king Jack King 10 a lot of these hands  
are going to want to try and fold out some of cut 
off's ASX hands right so imagine you check back  
some sort of top pair here and an ace comes on 
the river that kind of sucks for a hand like King  
eight right whereas there's lots of value to here 
I I like a pot siiz bat generally but it wants a  
nice big bat here but there's a lot of value to 
folding out these overcards right I couldn't care  
much about folding out most of these but folding 
out the a high is quite useful and I can still get  
a decent amount of value from these worst pocket 
pairs generally in three bet pots especially on  
when it comes to turn and River what I'm thinking 
about is a few main factors first of all is how  
does my hand play against the pocket pair because 
this is going to comprise usually on most runouts  
the majority of their call down range so I want 
to think about how my hand is doing against these  
types of pairs and secondly I want to think about 
what their overcards to top pair are doing and  
here if I bet big I know I can fold out a lot of 
equity let's try uh something else here Joy what  
do you do when let's say flop goes check check and 
out of position Pro bets how do you like to handle  
these spots yeah how do I like to handle these 
spots um usually you know usually some mixing  
some calling some folding I mean probably just uh 
depending on what the turn is you know if I'm have  
my Ace highs I check back I have my Ace Queens I 
have my Ace Jack like some of my my pairs that I  
mixed and checked back I'm just going to call the 
turn and call some raise some um I'll probably  
fold like my you know for some reason if I didn't 
see that I mean I don't know why but if I didn't  
see at my like 78 suited here if I didn't see at 
like my queenex suited or my jackx suited or 10x  
suited and depending on the card I might just 
start folding some too so but versus like that  
size bed I don't think I'd fold many a SI on you 
know if I got two overcards on a 10 I'm probably G  
to call at least one street and then maybe try 
to get a showdown maybe sometimes turn into a  
bluff so I'm probably staying versatile at this 
point in time but if it's against someone I feel  
like is you know crushing me I might just start 
folding here too and make my life a little bit  
easier I think you've got the right right idea 
here generally against this small like 33% prob  
B you don't really want to be folding a whole 
lot of ace high most of the time especially on  
a board like this right can't fold ace high here 
got to call that down uh so one thing that I like  
to do to try and develop my strategies here is to 
test out some random text and just get a sense of  
my thresholds so first thing I'm going to do is 
I'm going to press s a couple times SS and what  
this does is it just groups these actions together 
and what I want to do here is just kind of develop  
threshold so what am I raising for Value if I 
hover over this little icon here I can see how the  
raising range is constructed across all of these 
different sizes that we've given it and we can  
see that on a board like five de de four typically 
going to be raising over pairs Straits and boats  
for Value not so much top pair on this board 
and then lots of ace high King High these types  
of hands some gut shots for example as Bluffs now 
what I'll do is because this is just one spot I'll  
randomize it bam Ace 1065 imagine we went check 
check here I don't think we would this is kind  
of a range bet spot but just to develop a sense 
of what's folding in this case we can even see  
pocket kings is folding a little bit these pocket 
pairs start to fold we have a lot of hands here  
and what's raising for Value I guess two pair sets 
maybe a little bit of Ace Queen but again we don't  
get here too often then I just keep randomizing 
like this and I try and develop a sense of what  
can I raise for Value what's the strongest hand I 
fold in this case the strongest hand I fold is low  
pair on Ace Queen five jack what I raise for Value 
typically we're going to be looking at I think in  
game I I would go with Ace King like I I don't 
think I would have the konas to to raise A6 here  
you know but okay so I just keep going through it 
like this okay flush completing turn what are we  
raising for Value sets what are we starting to 
fold here a high these flush completing turns  
can start folding Etc and this is just kind 
of a I'll randomize it a few more times let's  
try and get like a low card board I love how you 
randomize the board textures too you're a you're  
a master you're a master randomizer Rand I don't 
know I don't know you come up with the strategy  
start randomizing I don't know how you go with 
this idea but you could in theory just prepare a  
subset of turn cards to look at but there's a lot 
of turn card this is interesting yeah I mean this  
is pretty interesting way to think about it yeah 
to go through again once you I think once you do  
this for like 10 minutes you're gonna start to see 
the patterns emerge um so again we see typically  
strong top pair plus is Raising for Value 
typically ace high sometimes low pair if it's a  
very connected run out it's going to start folding 
but everything in between your maid hands your  
flush draws your open Enders these hands cannot 
be folding against this size and I think just  
you spend 10 minutes going through that all of a 
sudden you start to feel a lot more comfortable  
in these check check lines where you face a proth 
100% that's definitely something the spot one of  
the spots I need to work a little bit more on 
because I I feel like I got my uh SE betting  
strategy no down but the checking back one is also 
very powerful too so you need to be prepared for  
both and you need to be practice for both in my 
opinion so that's that's for me my strategy it's  
going me my plan people underestimate the the 
power of just pressing the check button on the  
Flop there's a back in the day very few people 
were developing their delayed bets and their  
check check lines and so the first people who kind 
of took advantage of that had a big Edge in the  
game let's move on to different topic here now 
Joey can you tell me a little bit about how you  
like to structure your bet sizing across multiple 
streets sure I mean normally if I'm going to start  
off betting big on the Flop and like a big board 
texture then often times I'm going to be betting  
pretty big on the turn this is kind of assuming 
100bb if I'm betting small on the turn then on  
certain board textures then most times once again 
I'm probably going to going to go like small plop  
66 turn and then most times just shove River you 
know if I have a hand for Value in my in my bet  
strategy is going to be 33 then I'm probably just 
going to go bigger and that's going to be my like  
default value get in for the most part and I feel 
like you can't really go wrong with that 100 BB  
in terms of for the other big bets I would say 
my issue comes in is when I'm on the river and I  
have to decide what I follow through with because 
I let's say I bet big on that flop I bet big on  
that turn on the river I'm I'm going to need some 
Bluffs so deciding what the Bluffs are has been is  
kind of where I would say I'm I'm challenged at at 
that line right now just you know identifying and  
having like a horis to think through that process 
that one's a tricky subject so let's start there  
and I'll talk a little bit more about the the game 
tree later let's pick some sort of flop here we'll  
go bet call and turn let's put it like a 10 here 
I this is like the easiest just big big beted spot  
ever you know like exactly these these Bo you know 
these boards are just they they play themselves  
almost to me you know it's just like if you're 
going to better check here you're betting big  
or you're checking yeah exactly just play a nice 
geometric size here I wish they had 66% that would  
be perfect here we can of course uh Su that in 
but very easy you've got low low and then double  
Broadway where again this is pretty common because 
you're going to be C betting you're going to be  
barreling with Ace Queen Ace Jack ace7 pretty much 
all Ace like a lot of ace high here you know the  
better aces are going to mix but the better the 
worse aces are going to be pure here for betting  
you can see like A6 A7 so that board's interesting 
because then once you get called twice your River  
Bluff is you know I feel like you do have to 
mix in some of those hands as Bluff sometimes  
too it's just like hitting the right hitting the 
right frequencies and um because on the flush draw  
board you know they're going to have some flush 
draws they're going to have some suited you know  
seven eight suited they're going to have some King 
Queens King Jacks some slow played sets some you  
know Ace Deuces maybe that you know a is probably 
actually going to fold fold the turn but so it's  
interesting to think about you know how does our 
range interact with their range and then coming  
to some understanding of that strategy yeah this 
is where the the power of the ranges tab becomes  
really apparent using this comparison here where 
you're looking at the ranges side by side and  
inferring okay given these range a symmetries what 
does my range want to do and then just clicking  
the strategy button and observing the strategy 
making those connections is going to be really  
powerful so yeah ranges tab severely underutilized 
for sure so you had mentioned a little bit about  
bluffing and like choosing the right Bluffs this 
is a spot where there are many playable strategies  
um not this board in particular but in position 
River Bats typically it doesn't matter so much  
what you're bluffing with as long as it's like 
bottom of range stuff it's more important how  
often you're bluffing overall and so the first 
thought that crosses my mind when I would get to  
a river spot after a double barrel isn't uh what 
type of Bluffs should I use it's how many Bluffs  
do I get here with in the first place in this case 
it's gone King 10 43d so lots of bricks and of  
course we have a whole lot of random a high trash 
right and that's of course going to mean that it's  
going to want to turn some of that a high trash 
into a bluff but let's what I like to do sometimes  
is just iterate this River card so here's the 
three and again I'm just going to highlight trash  
hands same concept for yeah so here's actually a 
problem to I had when I first started this spot  
was that I didn't realize how bad the A7 A6 that 
those Aces were and I didn't realize how bad ace  
high hand in general was on for no Showdown right 
like in my mind those hands sometimes will have  
Showdown but it doesn't matter that they have 
Showdown those are the hands that become the  
pure Bluffs that was something that took me a 
little bit of time to get comfortable with like  
when I see King 43 I know if I have A7 or A6 like 
we got to go all in you know what I mean so I and  
I and and that that took a while and and like 
here's the thing it has let's say seven eight  
maybe 10% Equity maybe more if your opponent's 
a station and so these hands do have some some  
Showdown value and if you were to instead give the 
silver complete garbage here stuff that cannot win  
he would bet those instead right it's it's but 
it's doesn't have enough low Equity trash so if  
we just go to the summary tab sort by equity and 
I guess click again you can see that we really  
don't have like these hands are barely at range 
like we basically never have these low card hands  
and so a lot of the time it has to turn some of 
these ace high hands into Bluffs simply because  
you're running out of Bluffs right I just filter 
for the lowest like less than 25% garbage in our  
range we really don't have much right so I'm 
showing the strategy and the equity here A6 is  
one of the worst hands you can even get here with 
not to say it's like can never win but that's why  
I say you got to think about what Bluffs do you 
actually arrive here with and if the answer is  
not many you got to start turning stronger hands 
into Bluffs and so sometimes what I'll do is is  
I'll just um shift left or shift right is is the 
hot key for this is I'll just cycle through all of  
the river ranks and start to see what happens with 
different parts of my range so on most of these  
low cards we're still going to turn lots of a high 
to lefts but if I go up to let's say say we go to  
a 10 what happens to our strategy now like we'll 
notice that something happens right around the  
this range a jack I think which also completes 
some straight draws is that a lot of our top pair  
stops going all in here what do you think Joy 
would you ship it with Ace King here no I used  
to ship it with Ace King until I kept getting 
a bad Mark of shipping with Ace King and then  
I realized that I would have to go think about it 
differently because so if I feel like if I have a  
dynamic develop with you and you know you know I'm 
bluffing and I feel like you're just going to be  
overcalling then I'm going to be I'm going to be 
shipping in here I'm pray you don't have I'm going  
to pray you don't have King Jack I'm going to hope 
that you have king queen because also like at some  
point in time if you see an opponent God forbid 
they start calling you down with ace4 God forbid  
they start calling you down with like 910 suited 
here or something like that then you know to me  
those are the people that I want to identify and 
I want to be betting my asking for value and if I  
undercut myself 100 big blindes deep that kind 
of is what it is so as a standard I wouldn't I  
would say as a default I would just check back 
but I mean once I know that you're calling me  
more in this situation I'm 100% betting for Value 
something to pay attention to in three red pots is  
in particular how Ace Queen is affected because 
Ace Queen is going to be the most prominent hand  
in the pre-f Flop colar range generally speaking 
Ace queen or king queen that makes sense and and  
this is true in most three bet pots Ace Queen is 
is like the one spot you want to pay attention to  
so when the board comes King 10 Jack and Ace Queen 
all of a sudden becomes the nut straight you could  
have start being a little more careful here but if 
I change this Ace Queen to let's say change this  
jack to a queen feeling we're going to be a little 
more aggressive right so now we can start shipping  
it with Ace King simply because Ace Queen is no 
longer than nut straight we're not worried about  
our opponents having those hands as much and now 
you can start shipping it right so always think  
about especially in a triple barrel line where you 
know their range is going to be quite tight when  
they call down think about that that distribution 
I mean look at those blubs look at that look at  
that's a real interesting card so check this out 
every ace high every B high and low pair just goes  
off here even your reverse blockers your sixes 65 
you know those are going crazy here that's pretty  
that's pretty fascinating to me yeah I think 
part of it is like we just take a look at top  
pair plus there are so many hands here that want 
to just get the money and joy and when you want to  
Value bet more you also have to Bluff more and so 
for that reason it starts turning even hands that  
have some reasonable Showdown value low pairis 
a high all of these hands into Bluffs and it has  
to Bluff more because we're Valu betting more the 
only hands that have a strong incentive to check  
back would maybe be our second pair here queenex 
yeah I wonder what their calling range is here  
that good question let's see looks like they're 
calling with two pair plus always which isn't  
like sure they have king queen and some top pair 
just a little like the silver is going to merge in  
some of these second and third pair hands just to 
avoid having too many blocker weaknesses but yeah  
for the most part we're looking at so they don't 
have any they don't have anything to call with  
here yeah it's it's pretty hard to call I think in 
reality most people are just going to be calling  
down with like top pair plus probably folding 
most of these second and third pair yeah I would  
say like they're going to be over ambitiously 
calling with Ace Queen and then you know once  
what depends on like this is why you got to show 
them down some bad hands sometimes is okay so  
now if I if they start turning all some of these 
hands into pure calls where they're always calling  
with all their King highs and you know you can 
kind of run it differently and then if you look  
that look at that strategy then you might be able 
to you know you might realize your play here as  
in position might be a little bit different 
so it's kind of interesting to to think about  
if that would affect your strategy at all in 
terms of you know those Ace highs being pure  
Bluffs well sometimes if they're over calling you 
then some of those Bluffs actually don't become  
GTO anymore they become bad Bluffs indeed a lot 
of these Bluffs here will stop making sense if  
they're not getting enough fold Equity especially 
on the river right like it still makes sense to  
Bluff a lot of these hands on earlier streets 
because you're denying but by the river if you're  
fairly confident that your opponent is going to 
station you down well don't Bluff a station got  
said if they never see you show up with any of 
those hands maybe they stop calling down light  
yeah exactly I mean it go it goes but you know 
you can make a justification for either either  
thing that that's what's great about what's great 
about 100 big blinds tombos is like you know you  
can just like bet just bet on the river just bet 
you know what I especially three bet pots he can  
just play yeah three bet pots I mean you don't 
really got lot lot of things to worry about at  
that point in time just start betting and uh 
say your prayers so so so let's let's try one  
experiment here we're going to change that 10 to a 
10 of Hearts which completes the flush and I think  
something we'll notice here is that I think a lot 
of players are a little too aggressive on flush  
completing runouts so if I go over to the turn 
reports here I don't want any so I'm not filtering  
for anything I just want to show this spot I'd 
say this spot's pretty pretty a little bit more  
tricky for me too because um just visualize it 
and flush firsts flush ranges and you know how to  
value top pairs here how to value your Ace King 
no hard how to value your king queen no heart and  
then how to decide the combos of that you want 
to Bluff with in terms of their side cards and  
and reverse blockers and stuff like that so this 
this is way different spot even though would seem  
pretty similar it's actually a lot different it 
is yeah it's a tricky spot I think and part of  
the reason for this on flush completing boards 
is that you don't necessarily want to have a big  
bets anymore or not on a lot of flush completing 
runouts and the reason is that you start to bet  
too big on for example the T of Hearts here then 
you're not getting enough value with hands like  
top pairs over Pairs and you're narrowing their 
range too quickly towards flushes and such so what  
ends up happening go to the strategy here is that 
playing a little more passively but we're also  
typically going to start lowering our bet size a 
bit so you'll see a lot of 50% a lot of 33% these  
smaller sizes and we'll even see that and this is 
like a nice tactic to to know about on a lot of  
these runouts uh is that maybe I can make it even 
more obvious with something like uh Native hearts  
a lot of the under pair cards will go for a second 
small bet so there's like a sneaky play that a lot  
of people like to use let's say you have Queens 
here flop comes King 43 you're thinking oh crap  
I hate life I've got Queens the BET small on the 
Flop they stick around you're not happy but you  
can actually just put in another small bet on the 
turn on these flesh completing runouts especially  
when you have flush card blocker I should add 
that this is a good question to you Joey and  
the rest of the audience why do we think it is 
that Queen of Hearts Queen of Diamonds wants to  
bet here but for example let's say queen without 
a heart does not one this spots actually another  
this shows up a lot in singer race pot in position 
as well where you can start like small bat small  
bat the Flop and turn with these like second pair 
hands so it's kind of interesting it shows up here  
too I would imagine in this spot with the Queen of 
Hearts you can cooler some hands and you have some  
implied odds in terms of getting to the river 
with the heart so I I would imagine that you're  
kind of like it's like a merge in some ways 
where you're have the implied odds you also  
can get called by worse worse pairs that have 
a hard to and then even if it's a king then you  
could potentially yeah draw that hand absolutely 
spot on you know and so the important thing to  
realize is that if we're going for a double small 
bet strategy or like a small medium bet strategy  
they still have to call down with a bunch of 
pocket pairs you know like look at all the  
low pairs that they have to call you down with 
you're still extracting like some super thin value  
when you bet van like Queens here and so that's 
going to be a big part of it obviously you don't  
want to bet like huge on a flush completing run up 
but the nice part about this is also it's kind of  
an equity realization play to bet with thin value 
here because if you bet twice you get some value  
from these static Bluff catchers and then you can 
just kind of check back the river and enjoy life  
right I mean that that's why that's why I like 
that that small bit on the turn like kind of  
once you bet the turn here your River decision is 
real easy right just check back or bet for value  
or Bluff I mean it's like it's it kind of like 
takes away some I guess like uh problem spots  
I see you know what I'm saying I see some hands 
like I don't I don't want to have to check back a  
hand here and then the river you know the guy goes 
150% or something like that I'm like oh my God you  
know I just I'm I'm kind of avoiding a spot by 
the river against all players right I wouldn't  
say it's is doable against everybody but you know 
against those people that are really coming after  
you really putting pressure on you and they're 
maybe maybe they're going kamakazi with some  
of their Bluffs on the river River and you just 
don't want to have to force yourself to make that  
decision kind of just betting a turn taking the 
initiative away and kind of even having on these  
these flush completing boards uh you know maybe 
just going small small as your only strategy is  
like an easy way to play it you know you don't 
really got to think much about it you know check  
like okay once we once we bet a third on this 
flop and if we say okay like let's not complicate  
things let's just bet a third or about half on 
the on the flush completing turn this board is  
very common and that spot is very common so then 
you kind of need to just plan your River strategy  
to have a good understanding of what you want to 
do and then you kind of win that spot you win that  
hand this is a nice way to develop a game plan 
right we started thinking about what sizes we'd  
like to use on different types of runouts then we 
started assigning some sort of value thresholds  
to those sizes and develop that game plan uh and 
I think that's really an effective way to study  
because what a lot of people will do instead Joy 
is instead of developing a game plan like you just  
did what they'll do is they'll look at only one 
particular hand that they played oh I played fives  
here oh I folded fives here okay call when it has 
the the flush draw blocker otherwise not it's not  
an effective way to study you want to get like 
a nice Global game plan going yeah EXA exactly  
and you want to understand the the thresholds 
right I mean you T I think you I think you're  
the one taught me this really was once you start 
to understand understand the thresholds then you  
can start to understand why you're deviating you 
know it's you're building your threshold strategy  
to exploit and understanding okay well what does 
an exploit mean on this runout against this player  
I might be doing this because of of that and I 
against this player I might be doing this because  
of that so that's ideally where I'm personally 
trying to get to that understanding where you  
know I just know what to do against every player 
type and um I'm just making my decisions easy I'm  
trying to make all my decisions easy no blunders 
and then that's what's great about these trainers  
is you can drill all these spots to test your 
knowledge and wherever you're making your blenders  
now you know okay I got to like ask my coach I got 
to I got to ask somebody like what what am I doing  
wrong here so that's something I've been doing in 
my training is to identify where am I blundering  
how am I blundering and then okay what's going on 
here so that's been real helpful for me because  
now think about it we can just play this spot 
a hundred times and test to see if we know what  
we're talking about or not so I guess the the 
final thing that I wanted to chat about with  
you Joey how one can go about kind of Designing 
drills and practicing their skills against the  
silver and honing their intuition of course we 
have our GT wiard trainer here but I want to  
show you kind of a special method because lots of 
people want to train with all of these different  
bat sizes so what we can do instead is create a 
custom solution using GTO wizard Ai and what this  
allows us to do is we can pick our own bat sizes 
we can design for example and I'm just gonna click  
this is the one I use too I I I would use this 
one too as a start and then also you can edit  
you can edit these ranges pre- flops so if you 
think if you say okay well I think my opponent's  
ranges are different then you can edit these ones 
right so if you say okay well they sometimes show  
but theying suited you know Lord willing then you 
can start to add those in this is what I really  
love about I don't I don't personally know how to 
use this that well but I am definitely excited to  
learn more how to use this this part right and so 
this is all just about uh learning how to build a  
s so I think a lot of people will just pure call 
Ace Queen off here some some people are really  
good at forting it but some people just love to 
pure and then a lot of these like millon pocket  
pairs in the GTO Sim eights nine sevens these will 
actually Four bets at a low frequency but I think  
in practice most people just pure call these so 
you can you know plug in your own forbit strategy  
you can plug in your opponent's pered range or 
just use the GTO ranges Etc and there's your  
ranges right you can set the rake all of that 
and then here's the hard part now most people  
when they first use like a proper do-it-yourself 
solver they have no idea how to construct a game  
trait they don't know what sizes to give it on 
flop turn and River they don't necessarily know  
it's appropriate but what I like about GTO wizard 
is that it's got these automatic bet sizing trees  
and so just to give you guys a tour of what this 
might look like if I click automatic it's going  
to automatically reduce it down to one bet size 
per flop per turn per runout and that's going to  
change depending on the runout right so instead of 
having to learn these complicated mix strategies  
I can just say click automatic let it tell me 
what size the silver prefers in different spots  
obviously we're going to get a lot of 40% here 
here 773 likes a big size Etc and then I even  
take it a step further and what I can do is plug 
in my own sizes and let's say I like to choose  
on the Flop let's say I usually go here like 25 
75 and then you you know you're really not over  
betting so you know sometimes if I'm experimenting 
I'll put a check or overb here too just to build  
my overb strategy as well but I I probably 
would go like 25 75 and then check I think  
that's pretty good sometimes what I like to do if 
I'm making like a more General tree is I'll use  
it's called geometric sizing and so this little 
e here is why do you like to do that why do you  
like to do that instead because now it's going to 
automatically adjust to the stack tot ratio so if  
I want to come and reuse this beding tree 200 big 
blinds deep it's going to adjust that 3E sizing so  
that I have a bigger bet when we're deeper and a 
smaller bet when we're shallower makes sense right  
so as you get deeper then you're going to start 
wanting to bet bigger here right and so to any  
people watching this video later who don't know 3E 
just means betting an equal fraction of the pots  
in all three streets call that pot geometry uh and 
It's featured within most of our Sims very useful  
concept to understand within any three bet pot is 
pot geometry and why is that yeah great question  
essentially pot geometry let's take a toy game 
take some sort of polarized toy game where you  
have the nuts or Bluff and you want to figure out 
how can I get the most money out of my strategy  
like what bet sizings should I choose to make the 
most money in a perfectly polarized toy game it's  
always going to be betting geometrically and the 
reason for that is that if you bet geometrically  
your opponent is obligated to put the most money 
in the pot like for example you can imagine that  
we just ship all in on the Flop here our opponent 
is allowed to fold quite a bit and we can imagine  
maybe we go 10% pot 10% pot all in on the river 
again we want to get the chips in but we want  
to do it in a way that causes them to call down 
as wide as possible and it turns out that if you  
just take a look at the minimum defense frequency 
over all streets Bing geometrically will cause the  
to defend or obligates them to defend as wide 
as possible that said you don't always want to  
bet geometric sometimes there's competing 
incentives to bet small or B a little bit  
larger than geometric for more fold Equity but 
what I like to do is just start with a simple  
geometric calculator there's a formula uh we 
have a whole blog about pot geometry and the  
theory behind it but what I like to do is just 
plug in I thought you have all these like random  
R sheets of IDE like youve showed me youve show me 
every time there's like a then there's like a more  
impressive one down next one you show it's like oh 
my God and there's like four tabs and it's it just  
gives you I don't know it's a i I'd love me a good 
spreadsheet Joey there I can tell like it inspires  
me to make more spreadsheets I've been making 
more but not when I see all yours I'm like man  
what I like to do in any three bet pots is to do a 
little bit of spr analysis so here for example the  
starting pod is 92.5 or sorry 16.5 the stack is 
92.5 and so we can calculate the stack tot ratio  
16.5 2.5 and this will vary a bit depending on 
sizing but uh essentially if we bet 65% pot on  
all three streets we're going to get it in by the 
river 2/3 is going to be the recommended big size  
100 big lines deep now if we were deeper let's 
say for example we are 200 Big L Steed You're  
Gonna Want a bigger standard big you still want a 
small size but your bigger size ought to be bigger  
because now we're say 191 and 18 now your big 
size is close to parts right and so this is how  
I like to think about how to plan my bet sizes is 
I generally want one small size and one geometric  
size that's going to be especially powerful on 
later streets like on the turn where you have  
to start planning how do I get Stacks in uh and 
so when I'm building my game tree what I'll often  
do is I'll use those geometric sizes in order 
to adjust to different spots so maybe I'll just  
load one up here these are some parameters that 
I've I've built and saved and so what I'm going  
to do is I'm going to have in position have a 25% 
small bet and a 3E geometric size big bet in that  
other the turn instead of having 50 80 Etc I'll 
have uh I'll just simplify to something like I  
don't know 40% and 2E seems reasonable and then 
on the river I don't want a bet size less than  
half the pot in position one e is just all in 
so I can create this solution and I can plug in  
whatever flop I want take a look at the strategy 
and it's going to automatically tell me what size  
are preferable here so King Jack 7 especially 
since we've reduced it down to one size we can  
range bets a lot more let's go take a look at 
like a low paired board something like this 886  
886 is going to be pretty bad for us actually I 
guess not I thought it would be worse for us to  
be honest but betting big here you can see it's 
it's one size but the size is dynamic right and  
it's true for like that for the entire tree so at 
every decision Point I've set it to simplify down  
to one bet size and that bet size is automatically 
generated the nice thing about this is that I can  
take this tree and I can go practice against it 
this has the added effect of teaching me what  
bet sizes I should be using in different spots 
allows me to customize my betting plan and once  
like it'll automatically tell me what sizes to 
use but then I can start actually practicing a  
strategy for those sizes and so the the old adage 
occurs clear that it's not so important what size  
you use it's more important how you implement 
that size so Joey here's our trainer now I know  
you like multi-tabling so in the controls panel 
you can choose between one and four simultaneous  
tables if you want to multiable a bunch of spots 
and get feedback about your play you can do it  
here uh thought so far is that um I mean this 
makes it a lot simpler right I mean a lot of a lot  
of complaints people have is they they don't want 
to memorize multiple sizes so you know to me this  
makes things easier it's either going to about 25% 
or you're going to bet like 70% so you basically  
just have two sizes and then check I mean it 
becomes a lot easier to to do right I mean you  
know even here we already know you know top like 
I already know all all these spots just from kind  
of like right you know bet bet bet all of them you 
know what I mean so it's kind of the those are all  
pry interesting Joey says bet them all bet them 
all he says bet bet they're all it's all it's all  
GTO and this is where the trouble this is where 
the trouble happens oh oh oh and here we're facing  
check Rays bottom left with Aces but we have the 
Spade obviously you can't fold this yet k comes  
along so here here it's interesting because they 
you know you wonder what they check rais you with  
sometimes they check rais you here with like Ace 
Queen Ace Jack like tens and nines and they're  
very balanced when they check the turn the wizard 
is so sometimes they're going to be checking here  
with even Ace King and kings and I guess they 
don't have Kings but they have Ace King offsuit  
here sometimes too yeah yeah let's actually take 
a look at that so what are they representing and  
again I the way I open this is I click This Little 
Light pul it's an info button and now what I can  
do is I can just either jump to the solver or just 
open this up in a new window and so now what I can  
do is let me take a little peek at what they were 
check raising me with so King 10 n King hand class  
distributions well they've got a lot of boats 
a lot of straits lot of trips so this is what  
they're they're representing when they hit me 
with this and then if I think I go over to the  
draws yeah yeah lots of flush draws lots of combo 
draws tons of gut shots and then of course if I  
want to go study this spot in some more detail I 
can hit this little hat bam open it up here we can  
see like this is a hard this is a real hard spot 
combo right here this this a this is a tough spot  
from either either either way because once you 
check race here with the with all those hands  
and misss you're like oh my God what do I do now 
like I know any no matter which spot I'm in here  
on this turn I'm I'm like uh like Aces I'm like 
check and prey I mean but then sometimes you might  
want to bet so you know it's it's this is this is 
a dicey I think at this spot they they're raising  
so often and that's partially because we've we 
put the BET sizing down like when you bet quarter  
pot they are obligated to check raise you a lot 
I I don't think people are hitting this I don't  
think I don't I don't think like a recreational 
is hitting this at all I don't think most people  
are hitting this at all they're no no for sure for 
sure people are not check raising this much no way  
right um and so like but again we're basically 
range betting anyway so typically the way You'  
exploit someone who's not check racing enough is 
you would just bet more bet wider but here we've  
already kind of capped out and this is one of the 
maybe drawbacks of a really small size is that you  
don't have even more room to exploit you could 
maybe start sizing up I guess but yeah anyway  
on the turn like we already know that when they 
check raise us their their range is too tight  
but on the turn it's still getting tricky here 
I think what's really gross and like I actually  
don't mind fing another bed here but when they 
check to me I I'm lost here Joy like check rate  
and then check a three pot is is like a hard 
line to to figure out to be honest yeah I mean  
here here I'm probably like I I wouldn't just mind 
just checking everything back and then you know if  
the Spade misses I'm just going to Bluff catch the 
river with most of my hands if they go all in then  
I'm going flip a coin and make my decision if I 
think they're bluffing me too much and if I don't  
think they're the kind of person that's going 
to be bluffing me too much here I'm just going  
to fold if I think that they might be getting a 
lot out of line here and over bluffing with some  
hands and I'm going to click call and prey yep 
you know I I don't think I don't think you can go  
really wrong with that approach here and you can 
maybe start to get more gusa build the turn Strat  
like we're looking at here it says with trips and 
you know maybe mixing some Queens I don't mind  
like mixing mixing some of those hands and then 
pray you don't get check raced again and then get  
just check back on the river unless you have you 
know trips are better even even trips are better  
I mean you know king queen suited maybe but you 
know if they're the type of person that's going  
to have a potential nine or 10 here because we are 
going to be turning hands into Bluffs we're going  
to be turning Ace Queen into a bluff we're going 
to be turning Ace Jack into a bluff we're going  
to be turning our flush draws into Bluffs here so 
we really do need to start to find some value in  
my opinion otherwise if you know what I mean we 
just we're not not balanced enough and you could  
maybe you don't need to be balanced enough here 
maybe just you know play it safe and check back  
and kind of wait on the river but I think against 
an aggressive player here I want to start putting  
pressure on them I don't want them to get to 
Showdown with a a nine you know their n98 and8  
n 10 n you know stuff like that so I think one 
of the tricky Parts about this spot is actually  
finding the Bluffs because when they check raise 
you you're already folding out a lot of your air  
and so you have to start turning some of these 10x 
and 9x hens uh with a draw into a glove yeah and I  
don't I don't pick that up easy you know because 
I'm like I'm just saying oh let me let me check  
back let me get a free River card but I I wouldn't 
even consider someone normally thinking about  
bluffing with some of these combos but you really 
got to get nasty here with your Combos and like  
you kind of have to this is the this is what's you 
got to take it to the streets to the river all in  
yeah like you have to like blast off with some 
of these hands that you wouldn't think on this  
flop you got to go all in with but and you know 
that that's when it get scary and but I feel like  
that's where the best players are going to thrive 
is they're going to be able to put you in that  
position here yeah absolutely you got to be able 
to do it you got to just be ready to blast off  
especially when you're this deep I think studying 
three bet pots check raises and three bet pots is  
something most people don't do but it's a springly 
common strategy I mean we're still pretty deep in  
like a cut off versus button through bed P you're 
deep enough that check race strategies are still  
very very much a thing this is what this is 
what you what you just told me was that this  
is where the edges yeah yeah studying these these 
weird spots especially like spots that are more  
common than people know and spots where the pot is 
typically bigger those two factors and again spots  
where the population does not study that's where 
you're GNA have a lot of edge assuming that you  
don't have gaping holes in your game elsewhere 
this is like a nice uh side path to to go down  
to get become an experts in these I think one 
thing thing to pay attention to here is maybe  
we can find a good word for this but spots where 
the aggressor shifts so where it goes from one  
player to another in this case the Flop the outer 
position play cut off becomes the the aggressor  
and then on the turn in position retakes betting 
lead here and so in swots like this where you've  
kind of both had your ranges narrowed like we've 
both faced a bet at this point both of you have  
folded out a lot of your air and the bottom of 
your range is now closer to very strong hands and  
when your Bluffs are stronger when The Showdown 
value is stronger you need to adjust your value  
thresholds and you need to start turning some 
M hands into Bluffs because you folded most of  
the natural Bluffs on earlier Straits this one 
this one's gonna be making people's head hurt  
combos yeah I guess maybe just to simplify they 
they these this is where when I start when I'm  
when I'm coaching with you usually during the 
session you start really blowing my mind start  
crack cracking open ideas and all of a sudden the 
like my body like starts lighting up and and this  
is one of those spots where you where you're I'm 
like I might I might have got a little let me let  
me see if I can rephrase that thing is you you you 
got like the deepest levels of this explanation  
and um I know you're even you're simplifying 
it for me so I you know we appreciate that I  
appreciate that sometimes I can get a little bit 
rambly Joey so no no that's what I I that's what  
that's what I love I'm like you're you're getting 
me excited you know you're like yeah you're right  
like out of I position did take it I mean it's 
pretty interesting spot I mean I don't know I  
like this is real this is a real interesting spot 
to me just to yeah this is a fun spot I guess  
just in summary when you faced the BET and folded 
your trash now you have to start turning stronger  
hands into Bluffs because you already folded the 
trash so now we have to start turning nine High 10  
or you know second pair third pair Etc strong ace 
high into Bluffs so keep in mind the the previous  
action when you're thinking about Bluff selection 
a lot of players will back their strong hands and  
draws here but they might not be thinking about 
turning pair of tens pair of nins into a bluff  
as they should you're saying basically you always 
got to be thinking about what the hands are going  
to be turning into Bluff and on a check raise node 
when theoretically you're going to be continuing  
with a stronger range you have to start to get 
creative and pick non-intuitive Bluff stat yes  
under normal circumstances you would not say hey 
I need to go all in with Queen n on King 109 but  
in a check race spot you have to visually think 
ahead with that part of your range to understand  
that those hands are your Bluffs versus The Flop 
you wouldn't see that all yeah it's my bluff right  
three streets I'm in so you just got to be very 
selective on understanding how the node shifts  
your shifts your bluff Bluff threshold right 
and like the value thresholds are easy enough  
to understand on this front up trips plus betting 
for Value makes sense but finding the right Bluffs  
like a lot of players will neglect that part of 
their game is like okay my range is tighter I got  
to find new types of Bluffs that aren't intuitive 
to me uh and then they end up massively under  
bluffing stuff to pay attention to stuff like that 
means you can fold yeah paying attention to some  
earlier streets and thinking how the population 
might be play play that spot Etc so did you have  
any other questions for me while we're at it Joey 
questions for you I mean listen I got I got a  
million questions but I I guess my main takeaways 
today's are you know just better identifying how  
the 10 is that threshold card getting better at 
identifying you know checking back more on those  
low cards and kind of building that check strategy 
I would say turn you know I think we covered some  
pretty like interesting points I'd say to to 
the river being able to once again kind of just  
understand those Bluff spots I think that's going 
to be the thing that I got to really focus on and  
I think a lot of people got to focus on too so I'd 
say for me that's the one street I'm going to put  
a lot more thought into and just having a a better 
personal understanding of why to be bluffing the  
river with what hands outside of just like people 
are over folding here so I've got a natural Bluff  
because I have a big range Advantage you know like 
we saw that King tenan where I saw the A6 a7s know  
some of the other boards I would say the lower 
boards where you size up flop and size up turn  
like we saw that you saw dece 55 right 75 flop the 
turn once again that's a big bet on the river you  
know those textures to me are the ones where I'm 
saying okay once I bet my Ace King once I bet my  
Ace Queen like those are my natural Bluffs right 
I'm blocking Aces I'm blocking Kings I'm blocking  
Queens so just getting the proper understanding 
in those spots but I'd say in general the spots  
that we covered today you know a lot of great 
information a lot to digest kind of go back  
and and play around with and then come back with 
different questions in my end amazing well Joey  
it's been a pleasure studying with you today and 
I'm really looking forward to the progress you're  
going to be making in the near future here and 
seeing your journey as you become a GTO wizard  
oh yeah I'm I'm excited once again you know 
shout out to GTO wizard for for the partnership  
and obviously much love to you as always for all 
the advice you you know you help me out so much  
and I'm glad that you'll be able to help out the 
legion the Le the fans out there are going to be  
excited so yeah thanks a lot man I appreciate the 
lot appreciate you preparing all this information  
for me now I'm ready to [ __ ] battle you know 
so uh so yeah I'm excited I'm hyped up it's my  
honor Joey good luck in the streets man thank 
you sir I appreciate I'll see you soon [Music]
