### TOPIC: gto quiz
Hello Wizards! Today I've prepared a special 
GTO quiz with the goal of trying to trick the  
famous Poker Giraffe! Can I trick this 
GTO Guru? Stick around and find out.
QY (Qing Yang) is a GTO Wizard and Run It Once 
Elite coach who's taught more than 100 students  
across all formats! Welcome QY. Hi Tom. if you've 
seen his work you'll know that he has an excellent  
understanding of Poker Theory, so I thought it 
would be a good idea to test that understanding  
with a poker theory quiz. In return, I've come 
up with a separate quiz for Tom, and just to make  
things more fun, we've both agreed to make the 
questions as difficult and tricky as possible.  
This video will feature me attempting Tom's 
quiz, but you can watch Tom attempt my quiz on  
the Poker Giraffe channel. QY, are you ready for 
the hardest quiz you've ever done? Let's do it!
So Question One: Symmetrical ranges - both players 
have 44 through AA, and the board is 22233. The  
SPR (stack-to-pot ratio) is 1, so a pot-sized bet 
behind on the river. Now the question, my friend:
What part of out-of-position's range 
gains EV when they can block bet,  
compared to if they were forced to range check?
Can I can I take a look at the 
hand grid again? The previous  
slide? Sure. The only question is does 
QQ really benefit from a small bet...?
When you say block bet I assume you mean like a 
third of the pot or a quarter of the pot right?
Well, we'll make it simple 
for you - just pretend that  
out-of-position can lead for any size they want.
So they can shove, they can bet 10% 
pot, 50% pot, 25% pot, you name it.
Then I'm just gonna go with B then, 88-JJ.
Yeah, it's my final answer.
Locking it in, eh? Why do you 
have you chosen this answer?
Um because I feel like you know 44 - 77 
don't really care that much. I mean 44's  
clearly doesn't care what size it goes for. The 
only reason why we want to block bet is to get  
a little bit of thin value. With 44's that's 
not possible so that's out of the question,  
and then between like B and C I feel like AA - 
QQ... I'm not 100% sure without doing the math,  
but I feel like AA and KK the natural 
size would just be to go all in.
So for... yeah that leaves the only remaining 
answer as B - those are the main hands that...
Clearly, you don't want to jam with like 
88's right, so if you do not have a small  
size you'd have to check with 88. 
But you could potentially gain like  
a little bit more EV by block betting 
just to force your opponent to call.
Because I think if you bet like a quarter 
of the pot he has to call stuff like  
77 and 66 at some frequency just to make sure that 
your 44 and 55 don't get to bluff too profitably.
So that's my rationale for choosing B.
Very logical answer but the answer is C!
Which is so counterintuitive because 
everyone says that the reason you  
block bet is to over-realize equity 
with the middle of your range right?
And that makes a ton of sense. But if 
you actually measure the EV difference  
it's almost always top of your range that 
gains value with the block bet strategy.
I should add that this holds true at 
different SPR's (stack-to-pot ratios).
So, SPR=2, same thing. This even holds 
true if you plug in real ranges a lot of  
the time. Compared to range checking and 
giving out a position the option to bet,  
the top of your range is 
actually what gains value.
I think this comes down to the fact that 
in-position simply checks back a lot more  
if out-of-position is forced 
to range check. So the nutted  
portion of your range is actually what 
gains value when you're allowed to lead!
Oh wow, I was not aware of 
this at all to be honest.
So this difference column, does it mean that...
I'll go back to the spr=1 just 
because that's the original example.
So here I've got the hand and 
then this is when they have  
the ability to lead so the highest 
EV action given tons of bet sizes.
And here's the EV of out-of-position 
when forced to range check.
That's crazy man! Like TT actually loses EV
The middle of the range actually loses value! 
Which is so counter-intuitive. Like if you  
would have given this question 
to me and I hadn't studied this,  
I would have definitely got it wrong.
Here I can show you a solve for example.
Here I've given it a ton of sizes - 
I'll show you the tree here. SPR=1.  
symmetrical ranges and just 
a ton of different sizes.
We can see it never actually shoves 
but it does use for example, 50% pot,  
40% even 10%, and when you do bet 
small of course they're forced to  
call pretty wide but they're also forced 
to put in more money with a wider range.
When you check they will bet wider as compared 
to if you had forced OOP to rangecheck.
and I think that's where the 
bulk of the EV gain comes from.
The middle of the range actually loses a 
bit of money because they expect to face  
more aggression when you check with, for 
example, 88 or 99 or 77 or whatever right.
With like 88 and 99 uhh... Okay because I have 
noticed this in like actual situations where like  
on the river, for example, if out-of-position has 
like a block bet size, the times that he checks  
in-position is gonna bet much thinner for value. 
I think that's just like a universal thing -
Absolutely yeah - because the more you block 
the weaker your checking range becomes.
Yeah in that sense it does kind of makes 
sense, I guess. right when you are uh  
when you have this sort of block betting range  
your opponent is going to play more 
aggressively the times that you check.
So if AA uh... I mean the one thing 
we're pretty sure about is that AA is  
going to be indifferent between 
like check-raising and betting;  
that's usually the case when you 
have hands at the top of your range.
So if it's going to be indifferent 
between both options, then the EV of  
checking is going to be higher 
because your opponent is like putting  
more money in when you do check. So 
you know the EV of AA has to be higher.
So here is the same thing except 
we're forced to check out-of-position,  
and we can see that in-position, despite having 
all these sizes, just polarizes with a shove.
And because our (checking) range is 
stronger they are using a tighter  
betting range when checked to. So of 
course the EV of AA is going to go  
down right. Because your opponent 
is like so much more passive now.
Exactly. Then if we compare 
that to uh, with the lead,  
check- we can see that they're of course 
going to be shoving much wider. This is like  
really counterintuitive at first but 
I think that explanation makes sense.
That's an amazing question man! 
Like I don't feel bad about not  
getting it right at all because I 
would have never gotten this right.
So question number two:
Button versus big blind single-raised pot. 
How often should button check back on 
flops where big blind has a donking range?
Unfortunately, I think I've seen 
this one somewhere else before...
You might be aware of this concept it's 
not that well known but knowing you
Yeah, I saw this article from... I can't 
remember where exactly, it might have been  
something that you wrote actually... uh it 
was called like the 50% rule or something.
Out-of-position usually tries to donk a range  
that will make button bet at least 
half of his range went check to.
Because if Button does not do that, then 
Big blind's strong hands would all really  
hate checking right? Since your opponent is 
checking back so much when you're checking.
So big blind's gonna start donking more and more 
strong hands until button bets like at least  
a certain percentage of his range.
And it seems like that 
percentage is 50 although I'm not  
sure if there's any like intuitive reason for 
it probably just like a mathematical thing.
So locking in B then?
My answer would be 50%.
You're correct! Spot on, for the correct 
reason, and theory. Well done QY!
But is there any reason why it's specifically 50%?
I can speak to it a little bit.
So okay let's talk about the 50% Rule of 
Poker, which you actually quoted, impressively.
So the idea is that out-of-position should 
attempt to construct their checking and  
betting strategy in such a way as to force in 
position to bet or raise, at most, half the time.
If they can't do this then they should just 
range check because in-position is too strong.
And I think that your explanation 
for it is that our value hands,  
if in-position is not aggressing enough, our value 
hands have higher EV leading rather than checking.
So I think that that explanation is 
is going to be spot on. Now how that  
relates to being exactly 50% - I'm 
not sure, and the truth is this rule  
doesn't hold perfectly. It's more like 
a rule of thumb than a fundamental law.
We can demonstrate it a bit...
Let's take a look at some button vs big blind flop 
reports. Let's go ahead and apply some filters.
I'm going to apply a set of filters 
that look something like this...
So we'll say that it's all low cards and 
it's not monotone and it's not paired.
And if we just go back to big blind's strategy  
we can see that... Wait, did I get 
those filters right? Yeah, we did.
We can see that all of these boards 
are donked at some frequency. These are  
all donk bet boards, and if 
we look at button strategy -
You can see it's almost exactly 50 percent, 
and like a very very flat distribution.
So this rule does seem to hold under the 
right circumstances and here we see that  
in all of these boards just to clarify on 
the 50 rule big blind can construct the  
leading range such that button doesn't 
get to bet more than half the time.
If button could construct such a range 
then big blind should range check,  
because that's going to be higher EV for 
their nutted hands, typically speaking.
I don't know how well this idea of your value 
hands need them to aggress enough translates  
into in position needs to be betting 
50% of the time - or try to anyway. I  
don't know how well that translates but it 
does seem like a solid heuristic, at best
So let's go on to question three.
You're gonna enjoy this one!
You're playing deep stacked 
heads up. Hole cards are face up.  
One player has a pocket pair, and the other 
has a draw. The equity is exactly 50-50.
Which player prefers to get 
the money in immediately?
Oh man, I love these kinds of questions!
They are like IQ questions, in a way.
I thought you might like this one!
I'm gonna have to think a bit 
about this one. Take your time.
Which player prefers to get 
in the money immediately...
I guess the fact that there's there's like a lot 
of turns where A2 is gonna go down in equity,  
it kind of makes you just want to ship it 
in on the flop because you don't want to  
like find yourself in this situation 
where like the money doesn't go in on  
the flop and then you know you brick out the 
turn then 22 just gets to like, go all in.
That would be quite a terrible situation. So I'm 
assuming the equilibrium strategy is just for A2  
to ship it in on the Flop to avoid this type of 
scenario where you get shoved off your equity.
So with that in mind, my final 
answer would be B - A2 of Clubs.
Okay okay side question
if you're holding the pocket pair here, 
out-of-position, and you know that  
in-position is going to check back sometimes 
on the Flop, what would you do with 22?
if I knew in-position was going 
to check back sometimes...
I think I would be pretty happy to check actually.
I mean you check to him and have it go check-check  
sometimes and then just like 
ship it in on the blank turns.
Because you don't really gain anything from 
shipping the flop right? Like he's gonna call,  
obviously, and then you guys are just 
gonna split the pot in terms of EV.
So... Yeah. I think the 
fact that he's checking back  
sometimes is going to make you 
want to check all the time...
Yeah so I'm actually even more 
confident in my answer now.
That's correct!
Unless I'm very much mistaken
100% and you got it correct 
for the right reason as well!
The draw prefers to ship it in immediately  
and this is kind of a funky concept because it 
goes a little bit against our normal rationale.
But the fact that it's face up - mhm,  
so counterintuitive! Like we need 
to jam with 22 to fold out...
Like normally we think of these draws 
in terms of implied odds. You know you  
can get more value later, but the hands 
are face up there are no implied odds!
So then you have to think about what happens on 
the turn if the money hasn't already gotten in...
And the way I like to look at this is 
just to look at the equity of different  
runouts. So two's has appreciating equity. 
On the turn, 33 cards increase your equity.
And if your Equity gets increased by even 
a few percent, you can just shove and force  
the force the draw off their hand - 
because we're deep stacked? - yeah.
And conversely, the draw when it hits - it's 
already won, basically the full pot right.
If you make your flush you 
basically already own the pot,  
and so forcing 22 off the 
hand doesn't help that much.
So whenever it goes check-check it's actually 
hugely +EV in the pocket pair's favor, because  
the pair has appreciating equity whereas 
the draw has deteriorating equity.
in terms of the number of runouts that 
improve you the draw really only gets  
to see the turn card if they don't make it right.
So even though it's 50%/50%, the 
fact that you can be pushed off  
your hand on the turn means it's 
not 50%/50% after the turn right?
Really funky concept. Yeah really cool question, 
I like it it's more like an IQ question.
Now how applicable is this 
in actual poker? uh not very  
not very lol, but I figured you'd enjoy this 
brain teaser enough that I should throw it in.
Yeah I like these kinds of fun questions.
Question four: So two players - 
we'll just call them QY and TB,  
whoever they are, are playing a 
low-stakes heads-up cash game.
Now QY plays a fixed GTO strategy. 
TB is something of a calling station,  
and calls any hand that's mixed between 
calling and folding, otherwise playing GTO.
So how would their EV change 
compared to equilibrium?
Up meaning this player's EV increases,  
down meaning it decreases, and 
right meaning it stays the same.
Got it, clearly this has 
something to do with the rake.
And just to clarify we're talking 
about a Nash Equilibrium strategy  
(because some people define GTO as exploitative).
Assume in this context GTO means 
equilibrium accounting for rake.
Okay I'm gonna not like overthink this 
so much and then just go for the D.
D, the man chooses D
So, surprisingly, the answer is C on this one!
Oh man! - which seems crazy 
this should like seems like  
this should not be allowed 
- yeah what am I missing?
So this is one of those counterintuitive things, 
that again, doesn't strongly apply in practice.
Because in practice if you're 
playing a calling station,  
they're not just calling mixed folds, they're 
probably making a lot of pure mistakes too.
But you're right that it 
all comes down to the rake.
So the calling station calls more hands, 
and more hands are going to showdown,  
increasing the average amount of rake paid.
Ahh! Is it because the EV is 
already taking a rake into account?
Yeah! And the EV of mixed folds is already zero.
Oh man I knew I wasn't missing 
something really obvious!
That that's really the trick right - like if you 
take other stuff like hands that are mixed between  
call and raise into account, and you put those 
into a call, then it can also change the rake.
But, mixed folds are already zero - and 
you could test this with a simple toy game.
Give one player a polarized range 
give the other a bluff-catcher,  
test the EV with rake and then just redo it where 
the guy with the bluff-catcher calls more and -
Man I'm really kicking myself for missing this one
And this is such a counterintuitive 
question but it feels just so wrong  
that the GTO player is the one that gets 
punished for the calling station's mistake!
But this is actually a very real 
effect in actual play - in that other  
players' mistakes don't necessarily 
increase the EV of the GTO player.
Yeah I've seen this before, the 
rake functions as a third player.
Yes! So there are plenty of multi-way examples  
where two players make a mistake 
and the GTO player gets punished.
But the rake can also act as a third player, in 
that, the house's edge can change depending on  
one player's mistake. If you're increasing 
the amount of money going to the house,  
it has to come out of some player, and in 
this case, the station is only changing  
their strategy with indifferent call/folds 
which are already 0 EV to start with - so  
it comes out of the aggressor's 
wallet... Which is just so so wrong!
I feel like I'll get some kickback in the YouTube 
comments for this question to be honest...
It makes a ton of sense though, 
like I don't think it's uh  
I don't think this this is counterintuitive 
at all. Like it makes a lot of sense.
it's not like the first question where it's  
it's your nut hands gain the 
most from having a block bet.
This, to me, makes a ton of sense
Yeah exactly. I think what 
I missed is just that...
The hands that are mixing between call and fold, 
the EV is already taking the rake into account.
That's the thing that I missed.
Yeah like, they're indifferent after the rake, 
um and in position or sorry not in position,  
but the fixed GTO player isn't adjusting 
the strategy to punish that further.
And so something that I think people will 
argue like no Nash Equilibrium says that  
blah blah - but no - Nash equilibrium only 
says that no player can unilaterally adjust  
their own strategy to improve their own 
payoff - it says nothing about decreasing  
the other person's payoff without any 
gain to yourself. That's very possible.
You can spite call more bluff-catchers to 
have the aggressor pay more rake! This is  
theoretically possible (not recommended because 
it's super exploitable) - but it does exist!
It reminds me of like chop boards where 
the rake is so high that the first person  
to shove kicks the other person off the 
hand, but the other person could spite  
call and both players take a hit, which 
is kind of what you were describing.
I mean in the first place it's 
not like even strictly speaking a  
heads-up situation because the 
rake is like a third player.
Yep, you're right, it's not strictly 
a heads-up situation theoretically.  
The house is also a player - believe it or not.
An invisible hand taking money 
out of the pot, so to speak.
so let's go on to question number five all right
We've got a cutoff vs big blind single-raised 
pot on J7459 -flush is possible.
The action has gone check-bet-call, check-check, 
and here we can see both position's EV.
So out-of-position has a bit of an advantage on 
this potential probe bet spot, because in-position  
has checked the turn, and we'll go take a look at 
the spot in a second, but the question will be:
How does big blind's EV and strategy change if  
we remove all the second pairs 
from their range on the river?
There we go. So here we're looking at the  
GTO strategy... and let's just go ahead 
and highlight the second pair here.
Now typically, big blind will 
want to check their second pair,  
and we can see that second pair does have value. 
These are NOT 0 EV hands, these are +EV hands.
We can also see that the checking 
frequency is about 43% overall.
I'm just going to switch this over to "Vertical" 
because more people are familiar with this view.
So, what would happen to 
Big blind's expected value  
and their strategy if we just straight up deleted 
all of these second pair hands from their range?
Just to give you an idea, here's the EV 
breakdown - 6.89 for big blind 2.77 for cutoff.
so this is the... bet-check-bet line
You're not so concerned 
about like bet sizing right?
You could throw it in there if you 
like. This is an open-ended question.
I don't think that size is going to change  
much. Definitely the range is 
going to be more polarized...
Although the betting range might not be...
So second pair is a pretty big chunk of our 
range right, it's like a quarter of our range.
So my answer is that...
First of all, we start fast-playing 
a lot more of our strong hands.
So I wouldn't expect to see 
like very much checking from  
like flushes and straights, for example.
There would just be not much of a reason to 
check these hands. Currently, the only reason  
why we're doing it is because we have like a 
bunch of second pair in our checking range,  
and the times that we check our opponent is gonna 
bet pretty aggressively with hands like top pair.
Which is what gives the 
flushes and straights some EV  
as a check. So once you take away the 
second pair I'm assuming there's going  
to be much less incentive to be going 
for the check-raise with these heads.
Here's the other question: What do you 
think happens to the big blind's EV?
So it's starting at BB=6.89 vs CO=2.77.
How would their EV change if we remove 
these TenX hands from that range?
It feels like it should go up because
Like all these things that I work four or five 
chips, they're definitely below the average.
Worth less than half the pot?
So on this surface  
seems like our EV should go up. But then 
again, this could always be a misdirection.
And what about the fact that these are +EV hands?
So, for example, AT is worth like five bb
Yeah but still your overall pot 
share is like six or seven chips,  
so if you remove it, and it's below the 
average value, your EV should go up.
So viewers pay attention! Just because it's a +EV 
hand doesn't mean that removing it from your range  
would decrease your overall EV. it's 
about the pot share - the Giraffe says.
Yeah, you're uh you're absolutely right!
So the EV increases, for the reason you 
said. And I think a lot of viewers will  
be a little confused like - "wait aren't we 
removing this hand that's worth four bb?"
Well, keep in mind that it's 40% pot share,  
which means your opponent gets 60% pot 
share. If you remove those below-average  
hands from your range it's actually 
going to increase your share of the pot.
We can share the Sim here. Okay, I think I was 
definitely over-thinking this one! you were,  
you were, your first guess 
was just right on track!
You were spot on.
The betting frequency just increases, 
massively, even more over-betting and  
large sizes. But it splits between all sizes 
here. The reason is our range is more polar.
This is something that I've definitely seen 
you demonstrate in one of your videos -
if you remove the middling hands from your range, 
the hands that need to be protected, then all of  
a sudden you have fewer hands to protect and you 
can dedicate more of your value to betting lines.
Or you could look at it conversely, in that, 
the opponent is less incentivized to bet to  
make you know your second pair or 
your bluff catchers indifferent,  
and therefore your nutted hands 
have less incentive to check.
Ether way leads to the same answer.
Great job on that one!
Yeah this is kind of a fun 
question yeah pretty cool
Was I right about the way that the 
EV shifts? I mean I'm pretty sure the  
EV of the one-pair hands is gonna go up right?
Well, let's take a look. So 
for example we can look at...
Yeah, so here, for example, J3 has 61 out 
of 102 so we'd call that 60% pot share.
And a flush has a little bit more 
than the pot (120/102) 117% pot share.
Then if we take a look at the (GTO) solution... 
hmm, doesn't seem to change much, roughly the same  
EV
But these middling hands being removed mean that  
you have less garbage in your range. 
Also I think that more money goes in  
with this strategy, simply because you do have the 
capability to just put in so much more money with  
so many more hands because you're not dedicated 
to protecting those bluff-catchers as much.
So more money going in I would assume some 
part of your range does also increase in EV.
But the important thing is that these TenX 
hands, despite having like 40% pot share,  
aren't actually adding to your overall 
EV. They're more of a hindrance than  
anything else. (But they're still required 
in an unexploitable strategy, of course).

he's gonna quiz me instead! We'll see how I do.
That's all for now, happy grinding!
And thank you so much QY for this 
collaboration - it was so much fun!
Oh, thanks Tom! It was super fun for me 
as well. I loved all of the questions,  
I mean I definitely learned a lot and 
I hope everyone else does as well!
I know I certainly did.
