### TOPIC: gto analysis
what's up guys this is tom for gto
wizard today we have a hand played
between two 500 nl streamers matt
roberts and cg we're gonna analyze the
hand view the replay get their thoughts
and then compare their ideas against the
gto solution let's get started
joshie you're probably not running the
same you probably don't have the same
sims that i do i use a gto wizard 500
basic sims
so if you want to look at the
frequencies of my plays you can check
out gta wizard
leed's not terrible i'm probably
supposed to mix phrase and call
hey so this is an interesting hand that
i played with cg the other day the first
thing to mention is 109 suited is
probably a mix pre i would fold this
sometimes if not most of the time versus
a three bet in these positions now the
flop comes eight five four rainbow and i
thought this could be a board that i
potentially want to donk on the reason
is because we'll have eight eight five
five four four seven six at likely a
higher frequency than button but i think
it's really dependent on the range in
your sim and also the size that you used
i use 33 in game but honestly maybe a
smaller size might be better and
obviously the smaller you bet the more
often you could bet so maybe potentially
using a 33 this hand might not even fit
into that range but
we did it anyways
this is cg and i wanted to give my
thoughts on the hand with mn roberts so
this is me reviewing myself it's a
little meta but um i think at the time
you know when you're playing a hand you
don't always get a lot of your thoughts
through clearly so i just wanted to
elaborate on something maybe i said uh
in the hand
so the three bet is a pretty standard
spot button versus under the gun
we've played a lot together
in the pool
and i don't have any solid reads so far
as to
have a reason to deviate from
what i think is close to the equilibrium
so i generally play as as close to the
equilibrium as i can when i'm playing
against him
so he takes a lead line here and um
i think that is
a pretty good thing to do
how i'm supposed to respond to it i
wasn't really sure
i knew that i was at least supposed to
call it a frequency so if i do know that
something is a mixed strategy i tend to
lean towards potentially the more
passive
side of it if i feel like maybe
they're
leading
a disproportionate amount of
hands that they're gonna fold
so you do hear that from me where i
i decide to mix i rolled um i rolled the
rng
and i did get a 92 so that kind of
reinforced my thought of just calling
that being said uh there might be an
exploit here that i might not find
so matt opens under the gun cg three
bets on the button with kings and matt
calls with ten nine of clubs
lop is eight five four rainbow a very
interesting flop this is the kind of
flop that's better for the defender than
the aggressor we can see in the ranges
tab that matt actually has more equity
despite being pre-flop defender this is
because they have more straights sets
and a little more two-parent range
in the equity distribution we can see a
reasonable range advantage throughout
and that's mainly owing to the fact that
under the gun will have more middling
made hands
whereas the three better will have more
ace high kind of air
near the top we can see that nut
advantage owing to the extra straights
and satin range
the next question to ask is how can we
extend this analysis a bit further how
can we find some underlying trends well
if we take a look at the aggregate
reports we can see that these middling
cards
do tend to be bet a bit more and in fact
if we apply a filter for example
rainbow connected and somewhere between
five and nine high
we can see that the donking range
increases to almost 40 percent
indicating that these kind of boards are
excellent docking boards i'm sure matt
uses a very similar heuristic which is
why he found this dog bet at this point
i'm going to switch over to the general
solutions because these ones don't
actually have matte size
the general solutions button is using a
smaller three bet under the gun is using
a smaller open and we use a 33 dog bath
instead of 18. because you're using a 33
dog bet it doesn't actually choose the
dock very often nevertheless the range
is there
and matt did dock so he also mentions in
his analysis that perhaps a smaller donk
bet would mean you can dock more often
which would be theoretically correct but
i think it's going to be very close
either way and i think this dog bet is
playable so action's on cg and he
indicates that he knows this is a razor
full spot we can see that kings in
particular are one of the best hands to
raise
and that's because
kings is one of the few over pairs
that's stronger than matt's strongest
over pairs which is queens
of course it does mix calls and in the
basic solution it is also calling at
some frequency overall we can see that
button is raising very aggressively here
using well of course mostly overpairs
for value and this is to compensate for
the fact they have to overfold in
position
or theoretically they need to give under
the gun a worse price on a dunk bluff
and they do that by compensating for
their overfolding by raising quite a bit
now calling is also playable so matt
finds the call see this is this is
exactly what i'm talking about he leads
and the nut card comes for him he's
gonna have sevens he's gonna have six
seven suited he's gonna have sixes he's
gonna have some threes and twos
um but overall like we're not gonna have
a lot of this board we're not gonna have
a lot of 6x to call with
so we're going to be forced to call
turn is the seven of clubs which is
really good for my flop donkey range so
i think if i bet flop i'm probably
continuing likely my full range here for
a small size again i think maybe you
could entertain a check raise but i
think betting is probably just better
the turn is
is decent for him he's gonna have some
uh seven six type combos that's pick up
a pair he's gonna have some eight seven
suited maybe
uh he might have sixes or sevens
and against that range i don't think we
can really raise anymore
so we turn the seven of clubs both
players recognize that this is a really
good card for under the guns range matt
concludes that he's going to continue to
bet for a small size with most of his
range as is a common strategy after
you've dog bit the flop cg indicates
that this is such a strong card for matt
that he doesn't think he'll do much
raising against this size if we check
the turn reports
we can see that sixes and sevens are
among the most barreled cards
they also give under the gun a pretty
significant ev advantage as compared to
most turns
let's take a look at the ranges tab to
see how the ranges break down here we
can see that under the gun has many more
straights sets two pair and
proportionally more over pairs
than button that may be surprising
because button was the pre-flop
aggressor but
under the gun's range is tighter
conversely a button has more trash
particularly more ace high trash
and that's reflected in the equity graph
where we can see a pretty big range
advantage
for under the gun throughout
let's see how the solver constructs its
range
in the breakdown tab we can see that the
one-third range
is actually mainly used by over-pairs
particularly jacks and queens whereas
the larger 75 size as well as the 50
percent size
are typically centered more around sets
and straights
regardless
matt decides to bet small again
and cg makes the call with his kings we
can see the solver isn't really raising
too much here a little over 13 percent
but most of its range is middling equity
so it can't get too out of line
so we make the call
yeah
i mean the most intuitive bluffs here
are deuces and threes
and then
maybe some like broadways
what do we want to have to call
i don't have enough time to think here
i don't think he's gonna bluff enough
here river is the jack of
hearts and i think this is where the
hand gets really interesting so when i'm
in a situation like this i ask myself
how do i maximize my ev with my hand or
my range so what are my options
number one we could check and hope that
imposition bluffs or value bets enough
and then get value in the check raise
line we could maybe bet small again
hoping for a value raise or bluffs or
three just bet a size that i think my
hand can get enough calls with in game i
use shove which i think is fine in
practice however in theory land i don't
know if it's a thing because i'm likely
folding all the over pairs with the size
which is my main value target so maybe i
would prefer a bet still but maybe
smaller or maybe going for
a check raise
as well that that could potentially be
an option i guess it depends on how you
want to play do you want to play more
theory oriented style are you trying to
play more exploitative when you get to
the river what's my perception of
villain here will he open enough if i
bet like will he bet all those over
pairs that he probably should i think
it's a fair question to ask and honestly
i'm not sure and i think it's an
interesting spot and i think it's worth
looking at in solver even though it's
not a high frequency spot i think we
could potentially
learn a few lessons
so that if i ever do face a spot like
this again i'll be better prepared
um so just pausing in my thought process
i didn't think that he would have led
109 suited or that he would raise call
it from out of position
um my thought was ten nine suited was a
a pure fold if you were to open it from
lojack versus a button three bet
uh that being said i think it's probably
okay to call it a frequency i looked it
up after and it is a call at like a
quarter third of the time frequency but
it wasn't a hand that i was particularly
like afraid of
because if it was
a call versus a three bet it wasn't a
very high frequency one
so when it came to having a blocker for
this run out it's kind of hard to have a
10 in our hand unless we have tens or
nines but i'm thinking about it now it's
probably significant to have a 10
if we can as a blocker so when he does
inevitably jam here
i'm not happy clearly
so i think that
i use the term intuitive bluff because a
lot of the times there's some difficult
bluffs to find
in an equilibrium and this is one of
those boards that i don't think um
people are generally
leading queen 10 suited
very often although it would be good it
is a hand in
lojax range here for leading
so
in those scenarios i tend to fold more
against players
where if i think that a lot of the
bluffs that they need to have here at
the equilibrium are unintuitive that
they'll be under bluffing and they'll be
more geared towards value so
in this spot i think i
knew it was a very close decision for me
because uh we're not gonna have too many
really strong hands to call down here
with but um
i did think that he was probably
a little light with his bluffs here
so the river's the jack of hearts this
is a very interesting card because it
completes matt's exact straight draw
which is very disguised but it's not
fantastic for his overall range
in the equity distribution graph we can
see that under the gun has a pretty
significant equity advantage
throughout the middle but they don't
have the nut advantage near the top and
whenever you see this pattern you can
expect that solver will use
lots of small sizes pushing its middling
equity advantage
matt wants to get the most value with
his hand and there's a few ways to go
about doing that of course you can check
raise you can block bet hoping for a
raise or you can just bet large yourself
we can see that the blockbed here is
mostly constructed using top pairs and
under pairs for value
disguising and protecting itself with a
few sets and straights
larger bets in fact let me just group
some of these together
are mainly used by straights
and sets with very little top hair in
there
so matt decides he wants to go for a
shove
actions on cg who has a very difficult
decision with kings
now cg indicates that the natural bluffs
here are not so easy to find and that
may indicate a value imbalance if so you
should be over folding so let's take a
look what are the natural bluffs or the
silver bluffs in under the gun's range
let's start by filtering for the all in
we can see it's using king queen as a
bluff and six is for value and in this
exact case of course
king's blocks can queen so
probably want to fold but this is quite
a narrow range so let's expand this
we can see that the trash hands are all
these over cards king queen king 10 ace
queen queen 10 whereas the value range
are all the lower cards
so here's a hand that blocks most of the
bluffs but doesn't block most of the
value for that reason facing a large bet
kings is mostly folding we can see that
kings should be a zero ev call or very
close to it because it's mixing folds
cg snips it out and correctly lays down
his cowboys what a great hand by both
players
all right that's it for the video guys
we hope you like and subscribe feel free
to comment and of course join our
discord if you'd like to discuss the
theory further that's all for now
