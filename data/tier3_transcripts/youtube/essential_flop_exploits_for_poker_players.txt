### TOPIC: essential flop exploits
hello my name is Don coron and 
today I'm going to show you how  
to build crushing exploitative strategies using no
loocking before we get into it please make sure 
to like And subscribe it helps us bring more great  
content to you let's talk about incentives what 
are incentives well GTO strategies are in a very  
fragile state of equilibrium meaning if your 
opponent deviates from a GTO Nash equilibrium  
strategy even slightly how our highest possible 
EV strategy is going to change drastically today  
we're going to talk about how to use the nolock 
function on GTO wizard to learn about how those  
incentives affect our strategy and hopefully 
then we can apply this knowledge on the table  
before that though let's make a distinction 
between a setup and a punish a setup exploit  
consists on manipulating your range that gets 
into that mistake that your opponent is making  
that deviation that they are making from the GTO 
solution so any kind of adjustment we do before  
they make the mistake let's say our opponents 
raise the Flop too much then changing our cat  
strategy in order to adjust to that would be in 
this case a setup a punish on the other hand is  
whatever adjustment we make after they've made 
the mistake so in this particular example of  
them raising the Flop too much well we would see 
that with a different range and then after we get  
raised we're also going to respond differently 
than how we would respond against a perfect GTO  
solution let's start with an example this is 
blind versus blind single race pot Queen 832  
tone and we're going to be looking at it from 
the perspective of the small blind what I'm  
going to do is I'm going to force the big 
blind to stab the Flop too often and this  
is going to cause the small line to adjust in 
certain ways to do that I'm going to click on  
this node open the nolog function I'm going to 
increase betting frequency let's say to around  
48% going to lock it and I'm going to click not 
loock now if you want to learn how to use the not  
lock function step by step there's another 
video on GTO Wizard's YouTube channel that  
you can watch so as I said the small blind is 
going to adjust its strategy in different ways  
to exploit this leak I'm going to give you a few 
options some of them are going to be true some of  
them are not and you have to decide which ones 
are a we call with weaker hands B we fold more  
with weak hands C we Bluff race more D we value 
race more and E we check more with good [Music]
hands so let's go back to the CET note as we can 
see the CET frequency has decreased by a lot now  
we're almost checking every hand although not 
quite now just by looking at this visually even  
if we click on the compare nodes and we look 
at the original CIT strategy we can see that  
the frequency has been reduced but it's hard 
to tell in which ways it has been reduced so  
is it now that the betting the betting range 
is stronger or the checking range is stronger  
what happen if we click check and now we 
compare the big blind to the original one  
we can see that the equity especially if we go 
to the equity tab we can see that the equities  
have changed now what does this mean well if big 
blind's Equity has changed after the small blind  
checks that means that the small blind checking 
range is different is either stronger or weaker  
because the big blind's range is now now lower 
Equity than before we can infer that the small  
blind's checking range is stronger okay so one of 
the exploits that the small blind is applying is  
it's checking more often with good hands that's 
what would constitute the setup exploit if we go  
to the node after the big blind stabs we're going 
to see a very very high check raising frequency  
23.7% and a pretty low folding frequency 21.9% if 
we compare to the previous node we can see it has  
changed drastically this strategy now is what 
I would call the punish in this case and if we  
go to strategy here we can see the difference in 
frequencies and we can see that the check raising  
has increased by a significant amount it used to 
be 7.6% now it's 23.7% the fults have been being  
reduced but that doesn't mean that weak hands are 
calling more or less as you can see the threshold  
for what hands call or fold is basically the 
same right the same hands are calling or falling  
it's just that the left hand side range is much 
stronger overall right we checked more with good  
hands and so now even if we call the same hands 
and fold the same hands we are going to end up  
with a much lower folding frequency so the A and 
B statements were not true necessarily we don't  
either call more with weak hands or call less 
we do volue raise more as you can see ace8 A3  
are raising a lot more we do bluff raise more 
in order to balance out that increase in value  
and we check more with good hands those are the 
three ways in which the solver is exploiting the  
particular leak that we forced onto the big blind 
let's go back to the original set what I'm going  
to do now is I'm going to force the opposite 
leak I'm going to make the big blind stab to in  
frequently I'm going to reduce stabbing I'm going 
to lock it click no lock and let's see how this  
moment adjusts its C bet range as we can see the 
frequency hasn't changed all that much but if we  
go to the big blind and we compare the equities 
we see that the big blind's Equity right now is  
higher which means that the small blind's checking 
range is now weaker okay so we have weakened our  
checkin range in order to exploit a low amount of 
aggression in a certain line if now we go to the  
note after the big blind stabs we see not only 
a reduction in check Rises but a complete lack  
of them if we compare the strategies to before we 
see that once again there has been a reduction in  
check races down to basically zero and now we're 
folding more firsts the bed now again it's not  
necessarily the case that we are folding different 
hands right we're folding basically the same hands  
but we have created a checking range that is 
more weighted towards weak hands and therefore  
we end up falling more so the incentives can be 
summarized in this Four Points in in terms of  
setup exploits what we care is future aggression 
and future amount of folds in other words we care  
about how much money is going into the pot in that 
line if too much money is going into the pot we  
want to take that line with a stronger range if 
not enough money is going into the pot we want  
to play that line with a weaker range and we could 
do this in multiple ways we could change the range  
by adding more Bluffs removing Bluffs adding 
strong hands removing strong hands you have to  
be creative when it comes to the punish exploits 
what we care about ultimately is how strong your  
opponent's range is if your opponent's range is 
too weak compared to GTO then we will increase our  
aggression and calling if your opponent's range 
is too strong compared to GTO we will decrease  
our aggression and calling remember to stack 
the setup exploits and the punish exploits and  
you can even go back one or multiple streets 
and start setting up a really really really  
strong exploit to take maximum advantage of your 
opponent's mistakes to summarize exploitation is  
based on incentives when it comes to setting 
up our range for Success what we care is is  
our opponent going to put in too much money or 
too little money into the pot in that particular  
line when it comes to the punish exploits what we 
care about is whether our opponent's range is too  
strong or too weak be creative there are multiple 
ways in which you can manipulate your range to be  
stronger or weaker and you can stack multiple 
exploits to take maximum advantage of your  
opponent even multiple streets before the mistake 
even happens that's all for this presentation  
I hope you enjoyed it and learned something 
thanks for watching and see you in the next
