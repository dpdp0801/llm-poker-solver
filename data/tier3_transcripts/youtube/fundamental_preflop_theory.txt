### TOPIC: fundamental preflop theory
hello wizards today we're going to
discuss the fundamentals of pre-flop
theory we're going to start with some
basics range morphology the shapes of
ranges and whatnot and then we're going
to move on to some more advanced stuff
for example we'll answer should you open
larger or smaller in early position and
why and how you can adapt your sizing
strategy and your range construction to
different metas stick around to the end
and i think you'll get something out of
this
okay let's start with some basics the
fundamentals of morphology now what on
earth is a morphology ah it's just a
fancy word for the study of shapes in
poker morphology refers to the shape of
your range and instead of thinking about
each and every combination in range it's
often much more efficient to just try
and get a sense of the general shape
so there are four main types of ranged
morphologies you have polarized hands
that is to say your range is very strong
hands and very weak ends and few
middling hands we've got linear which is
just top down value we've got condensed
which contains mostly medium not a whole
lot of super strong or super weakens and
then we've got merged now merged is
something in between a polarized and
linear range it's more of a spectrum
typically you have some very strong
hands some very weak hands and some
stuff in between so understanding these
general shapes will help you strengthen
your concept of free flop and help you
play post flop better as well let's move
on to some examples so here's the quiz
match each of these preflop spots to the
correct range morphology you can draw a
line from any of these to any of these
take a moment and see what you come up
with
so the correct answers are as follows
big blind three bet versus a small blind
open is polarized that is to say strong
hands and weak hands cut off open is by
definition linear button calls hijack
open is condensed and a big blind three
bet versus a button open is merged why
are these the answers well the big blind
three bet versus the small blind open is
polarized since they raise very strong
and very weak hands and we're going to
take a look at all these ranges in just
a moment the cutoff open is by
definition linear top down value since
you only open good hands and fold bad
hands it doesn't make sense to include
anything but the best hands right a
button call versus a hijack open is
condensed or sometimes called
depolarized right because button is
typically going to three bet their
premium hands and they're only going to
call with strong middling hands like
pocket pairs suited connectors strong
asex some suited broadway stuff so it's
mostly middling hands and that's why you
would consider it condensed the big line
three bet versus the button open is
merged since it uses a mixture of nuts
bluffs and medium value draws so let's
dive into range morphology and what this
looks like in practice preflop let's
start with linear because it's the
easiest to understand again linear just
means top down value so for example a
cutoff opening range you're just opening
the best hands and folding the worst
hands it doesn't make sense to open
seven two off suit while folding jack 8
suited right so it by definition this
must be linear
and it's the same with for example you
know what let me switch over to the
simple solutions which use a three bet
fold strategy
anytime you're just three bet slash
folding it only makes sense to continue
with the best hands and fold the worst
so by definition your range is linear
it's uncapped it's top down value when
you're playing against someone with a
linear range it means they can have all
the strongest hands that means you need
to play relatively cautious against them
right
so think about the shape of the range
before you attack it next up we have
polarized ranges and you know what i'm
going to switch to
maybe 50 and l for this one so small
blind opens action on big blind and here
we can see they have very strong hands
at the top and a lot of zero ev trash
now people have different definitions of
this stuff like is queen nine a value
raise or a bluff phrase what about six
five suited what about ace four city the
easiest and quickest way to settle this
debate is to view the expected value of
the three betting range now we can
visualize this color coded so
very weak value all of these zero ev
hands and very strong value
it's true there are some you know mergy
hands in here
but the bulk of the range is quite polar
and this is about as polar as you're
gonna get when it comes to three bets
nutted hands and trash now because of
that
small blind adjusts their for betting
strategy in most spots
when you face a three bet and you're out
of position you want to raise larger the
idea is that you know you want to force
more folds out of position but blind
versus blind in particular is different
because big blind's three betting range
is super polarized therefore the most
effective strategy is to raise small out
of position that's because
you don't need a huge bet to fold out
10 2 suited and king six off right
doesn't make sense to race to like 28
big blinds to blast them off these hats
it's much more effective to use a
smaller four bet
because these zero ev hands fold to
pretty much any size while you donate
the least amount to their nutted hands
now
in practice you're going to use
polarized ranges pretty much any time
you have a fold a call and a raise and
you're going to go more polarized in
position than out of position so for
example
let's say small blind three bets and you
know what i'm going to switch to 500 nl
just because it's maybe easier to see
the polarization when ranges are wide
so button opens small blind three bets
action back on button we can see the
four betting range is comprised of
very low value hands and very strong
hands and some people are like well you
know is ace jack a value raise or a
bluff phrase
it's a bluff phrase
right
weak
bluffs
and strong value and not a whole lot of
in between
and everything in between
goes into the call so very polarized
when you're in position conversely when
you're out of position you tend to
merge a bit more so for example cut off
opens button three bets
here we can see that
cut off is for betting with hands like
queen suited king jack suited jack 10
suited you know it's not really bottom
of range stuff it's more like the bluffs
have shifted inwards a bit
maybe one way to visualize that is by
the expected value there's more of these
inward bluffs they're not all zero ev
hands
and the reason for this is twofold first
of all
the value of calling is just going to be
lower
when you're out of position facing a
raise so you have less incentive to call
and furthermore when you do raise
you need some stronger hands to
disincentivize
button from continuing
if you were to raise too polarized out
of position button would be incentivized
to continue most of the three betting
range
and this is true everywhere out of
position tends to polarize less than in
position in position tends to polarize
more than out of position mainly due to
the incentives for calling
versus raising okay so let's move on to
condensed ranges now condensed ranges
are kind of fun
picture this you open hijack
and oh i better switch to the general
solutions because these have calls on
the button
you open early position and you get
called
by the button bad situation you don't
like this happening to you
well a condensed range consists of
medium strength hands right buttons
calling range here doesn't have the
premium hands it also doesn't have many
weak hands it's mostly going to be
medium strength pocket pairs you know
suited aces to the connectors strong
broadway hands stuff like that now in
general
when you do get cold called by someone
in position you mostly want to check to
them on the flop i think a lot of people
will bet too often in that scenario but
even though this range is relatively
capped
just to take a quick look at the reports
here
we can see that
over
every possible flop
hijack despite being the pre-flop razor
despite having all the strongest hands
in range checks 71 of the time across
all possible flops
and that's because
button's calling range here
despite being somewhat
capped is still quite strong they need
to make their range strong enough so
that when they call they don't get
abused and squeezed out of the pot too
often by the blinds and so when both
blinds fold buttons range is actually
pretty strong relative to hijacks range
which has
lots of high card air so you see
condensed ranges pretty much anywhere
where people are going to call
um
for example
you know you could call maybe but big
blind is a bad example because it's
quite wide but a small blind calling
range for example is quite condensed
because it contains lots of medium hands
but not a whole lot of trash so in
general condensed just means medium
hands you're condensed towards the
middle of your range you don't have all
the nutted hands you don't have all the
weekends you have mostly middling hands
something to keep in mind though is that
you know you may start as a condensed
range but then if the board comes like
789
well all of a sudden this range might be
much stronger than this range
something to keep in mind okay so we've
covered linear polarized and condensed
the last topic is merged and merged is a
complicated one that's going to take a
little more explaining so the last
morphology is merged now merged is a
difficult concept that people tend to
struggle with it's usually
not well defined on the internet so
realistically merged can be thought of
as something in between a polarized and
linear range let me show you what i mean
here we have a big blind facing a button
open
again i can isolate this three betting
range i'm gonna change that to ev so
it's color coded so
we have
very strong hands
we have like zero eevee bluffs
and then we've got the merged stuff
these suited connectors lower pocket
pairs offsuit broadways stuff like that
so merged contains strong hands
bluffs and middling equity but it's not
necessarily one shape it can lean more
linear or more
polar depending on the situation
and let's dive into exactly what that
means so
the best way to study this is to compare
different structures i'm going to change
this over to the heads up solutions
here small blind opens a wide range in
heads up you open like 80 percent
and in this solution big blind is using
a 10 bb 3 bet and we can see a lot more
middling hands in there right
a lot more yellow green
fewer bluffs
so this three betting strategy leans
more towards the linear side of the
mergy spectrum
and now let's compare to
the
50nl
general solutions
now 50 l you pay more rake and at the
same time big blind is using a large
three bet here it's 13 bigs
so
this one
is going to lean more towards the polar
side of the mergy spectrum right we've
got more of these zero ev hands
and very strong hands and fewer of those
middling equity hands
now why is this
you know you can make theories but
the
best theory the easiest way to
understand this is always to look at
villains response let me show you what i
mean when big line 3 bets what you want
to do is look at the ratio of
four bets to calls you'll face when they
continue in this case
we expect to face a four bet about as
often as we expect to face a call in
fact let's map this out just to get some
exact numbers here
we expect to face a 4-bet
14.6 percent of the time
divided by the 32 percent of the time
that they continue
so almost half the time forty five
percent we expect to face a four bet
and what does that mean for the hands in
our range
well
a hand like jack four doesn't mind
folding to a four bit this is a zero ev
hand it was almost worthless as a call
to begin with i mean yeah you you do
lose your three bet but compare that to
queen jack suited queen jack suited is
worth eight big lines as a call so it
really sucks to get blasted off your
equity when you hold a high value hand
like king jack suited or queen jack
suited and you're gonna get blasted off
your hand a lot more often
when you face a four bet right
therefore
what really matters is the ratio of four
bets to calls that you face and this is
true
not just in the big blind versus button
but everywhere in poker pre-flop post
flop it's true in exploitative theory
you know against stations you want to go
more linear against maniacs you
typically want to go more polar you
don't want to
bet fold
high ev hands
or like
hands that would be decent as a call now
let's compare that to the 500 nl basic
solutions
so in this case button opens
big blind three bets and here big blind
is using a smaller three bet in these
basic solutions only 11 bb instead of
13. furthermore 500 nl pays less rake
which further incentivizes button to
call what does this mean well it means
that we're going to use more of these
middling equity our
range is leaning more linear on the
mergy polar spectrum right
there's fewer zero ev bluffs
and if we look at buttons response it
makes sense
because we can see that out of the times
they do continue well first of all
they're continuing much wider overall
given that they're getting better pot
odds and they're paying less rake but
when they do continue we only expect to
face a raise 11.5 divided by 48 23 of
the time compare that to the 45 percent
of the time we expect to face a raise
you know in the last situation therefore
our middling equity
you know our jack 10 suited
our king 10 suited
our 10 8 suited
our a7 suited our ace jack off suit
these hands which are high ev calls are
going to be blasted off their equity
less often and they don't so much mind
facing a button call
therefore
it's more effective to use these hands
rather than use super polarized hands so
that's the theory behind merged three
bets and merging in general and like i
said this carries forward pose flop this
carries forward to how your opponents
play generally if you're facing a bet
and you three bet or you check raise you
want to use more polarized ranges if you
expect to face fold slash rays and you
want to use more linear ranges when you
expect to face more calls and fewer
races and that's because it's less
effective to raise fold high ev calls
like 88
for example
the last concept i'd like to discuss is
your open raise sizing back in the day
people thought it was a good idea to
open big from early position and smaller
from late position and it makes sense i
mean you have a stronger range in early
position you have a weaker range in late
position so why not go big here and go
small here and then solvers came along
and they said no no no i want to do the
exact opposite i want to open small in
early position and big in late position
why is that well again it comes down to
the ratio of three bets to calls you
expect to face when under the gun opens
most competent players especially in a
ranked environment are going to use a
three bet or fold strategy namely
because a your range is tight but also
because there's more players in front of
each other so the threat of being
squeezed makes calling less attractive
therefore
because under the gun expects to face
more three bets and fewer calls they use
a smaller size that way
they lose less
facing a three bet right it costs less
to bet fold
and your nutted hands always have the
option to reopen the action via a four
bet if they so choose
conversely in late position
you expect to face a higher ratio of
calls and a lower ratio of three bets
therefore you can size up without
risking that folding as often now here's
a little quiz for you why do you think
it is that under the gun bolts hands
like ace 2 suited ace 10 off king jack
off
in this rake structure this is 500 nl
using a two big blind open however if we
switch to 50 and l
and we open larger two and a half x
we're paying more rake we're opening
bigger and now we're opening more of
these trash hands we're opening
you know i'm just going to show the
eevee here ace 2 goes from a pure fold
to a pure open
ace 10 off and king jack off or opened
in full
you know even lots of queen jack off
why is that again same concept comes
down to the ratio of three bets to calls
you expect to face these hands
ace ten king jack ace deuce king five
king seven
they're great at blocking three bets you
block the main category of hands that
three bets you aces kings ace king
but they're pretty terrible facing a
call i mean i know ace 2 suited looks
pretty because it's suited and it's a
wheel ace but it's really not very good
facing a call in exchange for these
blocker hands it starts folding most of
these pocket pairs and suited connectors
because it expects to face a raise more
often and these hands don't block raises
conversely if you open smaller
and
if you
play at
a rake structure like 500 nl where
you're not paying as much rake
it gets rid of a lot of these blocker
bluffs
you know now ace 10 is starts folding
king jack starts folding
suited king x starts folding ace two is
pure folding
and in exchange it opens more pocket
pairs and suited connectors because
these hands do better facing calls and
worse facing three bets or they don't
block as many three bets per say
so this is why in a lot of metas for
example live one two you'll see people
opening really large in early position
because opening large makes sense if you
expect to face very few raises and more
calls it makes sense to pump up the pot
with strong hands if you're not being
blasted off your hand right it doesn't
cost much to bet fold if you're not
being raised very often that's why
you'll see people opening you know five
big blinds in live games because
under the gun will open and then cut off
will float you with like
i don't know
seven three suited
so think about your games think about
your meta are people calling too wide
and not raising enough if so perhaps you
should switch away from these blocker
hands and open
more of these pocket pairs and suited
connectors and maybe size up a little
bit and
maybe if you play i don't know online
like low to mid stakes where people are
mostly using three bet fold strategies
you want to cut out a lot of these
pseudo connectors and low pocket pairs
and trade them out for some
blocker hands instead and maybe decrease
your rfi sizing adjust your strategy
depending on your meta and don't just
lazily use a 2.5 everywhere because
there is edge to be gained by thinking
about how you should size your opening
range and adjust
your range morphology
