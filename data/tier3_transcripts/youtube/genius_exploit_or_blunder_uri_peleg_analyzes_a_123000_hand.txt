### TOPIC: hand analysis
[Music] hey guys what's up this is URI pelic 
for GTO Wizard and I wanted to show you guys a  
very crazy super high stakes hand where one of the 
players did something that's a bit off the rails  
and I'm going to show you how to use GTO wizard to 
try exploring his thought process and getting into  
the mind of someone who's clearly very very 
good and has thought things through [Music]
this hand is being played at 2400 GG Network 
between Daniel and Glory B Glory B is AEG on  
multiple sites I think he's originally American 
and I have rumors about his name but let's just  
say he's been around a long long time and very 
good player and Daniel newer on the scene but  
you know crushing all the highest Stakes right 
now so yeah the these guys start the hand Daniel  
raises BVB to 1,200 or three big blinds Glory B3 
bets him to 3 and a2x uh they're 150 deep Daniel  
forb bets to 10,400 and Glory B calls and we see 
a flop with roughly 21k in the middle and aboard  
comes Ace king queen twoone so as high a board 
as you can get and four bet ranges are high card  
heavy and they're about as high card heavy as you 
can get get right single raised pot versus three  
bet versus four bet we're just getting Tighter and 
Tighter so kind of crazy already at this point but  
definitely very good board for the for better 
because a guy calling is going to have the low  
pocket Pairs and suited connectors and stuff like 
that whereas the four betting range is going to be  
more top heavy more Ace Kings and Ace queens 
and Aces kings queens and if you think about  
a hand like Jack 10 if it forb bets it might 
have to turn itself into a bluff on this board  
so yeah Daniel starts with a small uh third pot 
bet a bit less indicating he's probably just  
putting pressure on with almost all of his range 
and glory be calls and at this point the ranges  
are going to be a bit more equal uh we get four 
of Spades turn for a brick uh Daniel bets 9 into  
32 and A2 so again somewhere between 25 and 33% he 
has some Mal key there and Glory B throws in the  
minrs to which Daniel shs and glory be calls for 
another 60 big blinds or so and we see a showdown  
with Daniel having poet queens and glory be having 
Ace Queen offit and at first glance this doesn't  
make any sense to me because Ace Queen offit I I 
mean first of all why Min is on a turn what's the  
rush water you deny Equity from and you know your 
rrange is it a dis Advantage so I I don't really  
see much reason to fast play generally when your 
range is a a disadvantage and you don't need much  
protection rather than fast playing you slow play 
top of your range to slow your opponent down on  
the river to kind of protect the rest of your 
range and I would have assumed this is a spot  
like that where there are not really many fast 
plays if at all and second you know the sizing  
maybe I can understand but the the hand Choice 
A queen opsu just seems too weak I mean look at  
the board the four better is going to have Ace 
King Aces kings queens uh water you beating with  
Ace Queen you're hoping for a miracle king queen 
or Ace Jack that's probably not putting a stack  
in it it just seems like over playing the hand so 
the entire hand seems weird and I'm going to show  
you guys how we can use GTO wizard to dive in and 
break it down so we're loading the hand in GTO Wiz  
I'm going to go for I guess chv or NL 10K let's go 
NL 10K CU rayon GG network is a bit higher and 150  
deep and here small blind raises to 3 and 1/2x 
which is it's not exactly the same details but  
it's close enough and and certainly once we Face 
the forbat we're going to be you know ranges are  
going to be close enough and spr is going to 
be close enough so yeah we have the forb BET  
and note that Queens is always for betting as 
his Jacks and Ace queen off suit as well very  
often and interestingly enough at 150 deep with 
these sizes the in position player slow plays a  
ton against the forb and this is just a function 
of of all the sizes and the stack depth where  
shoving is a bit much uh plus you're in 
position and you don't have room to click  
it back so it just creates a situation where 
you slow play all the time and if you think  
about it probably very few people do this 
and not many people even look at 15 deep  
Sim but yeah either way we'll progress from 
there and click call and solve post flop with
AI and as we expected this board is very very good 
for the out of position player and he gets to bet  
close to his full range I think the sizing used in 
the hand and this is not terribly important but we  
might as well is is more like a 29% than a a 25% 
so 29% and in position exclusively calls which  
as I said this is kind of what happens when you're 
at a big disadvantage and even though you can have  
Aces or Jack then they don't need protection and 
you really want to try to help the rest of your r  
C Showdown not let your opponent Barrel Into You 
Like Crazy by fast playing everything so yeah we  
have a call turn brick E4 and let's take a look at 
what happens here so first of all the solver is B  
size of choice is 46% so larger than we saw happen 
and if we click that bet size in there is no real  
Min raising of course it's it's tiny bit of shoing 
and almost never with Ace queen super duper rare  
and that's just because there's not much money 
behind and now we're going to have to edit the  
sizes and and see if we can make this uh make some 
more sense so like we said the BET size itself was  
somewhere around this so a smaller betat this 
small bet lets the out of position player this  
is important keep barreling kind of dear so king 
queen Ace Jack Ace 10 and like I was saying we're  
going to use pocket T and pocket jacks and King 
Jack and all these hands is kind of merge barrels  
because you know they're just not uh showing 
down for very much money and they have these nice  
removal properties so versus a small betting and 
there is no raising for in position and certainly  
no raising with Ace Queen because it's not strong 
enough and you know everything like I was saying  
the play with Ace Queen doesn't make sense so 
how how would it make sense pause a video and  
try to think what might have been going through 
Glory be's mind as he's making this rise okay so  
one thing and I think this is a key part to make 
this phrase make sense is you have to understand  
the chaos of this situation and that when you're 
150 deep out of position forb B and you get this  
unique structure of as high a board as possible 
a lot of people or I dare say all people don't  
have their bet sizes is completely mapped out and 
so this 29% bet when you see it you can assume oh  
this is the only bet size this guy is going to 
have but you could also assume that maybe he's  
going to have more than one bet size depending on 
his hand and if we let the solver have more than  
one bet size of course the the solver would 
balance both b sizes but we know the solver  
doesn't like this 29% size it's the wrong size 
that should always be a warning flag that well  
if this guy is batting the wrong sides maybe 
something about his batting strategy is weigh  
towards hands that want that size and if we look 
and we say okay well 60% is clearly used more than  
29% but 60% doesn't let us SP Ace Jack and Ace 10 
and it doesn't let us SP king queen every time we  
might stop and say well when I see 29% that range 
is probably going to be weighed around and we'll  
see this here the major hands in this range are 
going to be ace and Ace Jack and king queen and  
so if we throw in a 29% bet suddenly Ace queen off 
suit starts raising and suddenly everything makes  
sense but it's still only raising a small amount 
now this is where no Lan comes in and this is  
where the the genius of the the guys playing here 
can kind of be shown is that introduce a little
Anarchy upset the established 
order and everything becomes
chaos I'm an agent of chaos well like we said 
this 29% almost doesn't exist right it's it's very  
mixed but if we were to no lock and we'll say you 
know the 29% bet were we're going to make it more  
often with the hands that fit for it okay so let's 
say we go 100% of the time Ace Jack offit Ace 10  
offit king queen off suit and king queen suited 
and all of these hands where you know this B size  
kind of makes sense for your hand are going to go 
be thrown in there and we don't know about all the  
other hands we don't know what they would do but 
certainly we expect you know once we see these  
hand once we see the size for all of these hands 
uh to be heavily in there and now we can click no  
lock and what the program will do is it'll lock 
those specific hands and then it will kind of try  
to balance everything else around that to have an 
actual range so it'll add some slow plays and add  
some Bluffs Etc but the core of the range is going 
to be those hands and they're going to be pushed  
in there and if we do this and we click back 29% 
again and a queen off suit raising more but not  
every time now to make it raise every time we'd 
have to throw in kind of a last node lock but one  
that has the same logic as as this one and that 
would be that when a human has this kind of range  
it's actually not correctly balanced and it's a 
bit uncalibrated so Ace king is not mixing in a  
slow play and Jack 10 is not mixing in enough slow 
plays and so this range starts becoming unprotect  
and if we were to nolock that and that requires 
you know a bit more of a stretch in a way but uh  
what we would do is go here and be well Ace King 
is going to always bet big and let's say Jack 10  
is always going to bet big or I guess wit hand 
would we throw in there that would make the most  
sense yes sayy Kings so you kind of remove those 
SL plays and then you have to click lock un loock  
all and this is a bit problematic because now the 
range is going to be unbalanced and if I were to  
do it differently the solver would add different 
slow plays instead of the ones I'm removing we  
could do that as well and and just kind of lock 
all the slow plays and and let it handle that  
and maybe that would be better but yeah now we 
click b 29 and a queen is just a a very frequent  
CH and presumably something like this is is 
W was going through Glory B's mind so a hand  
that at first glance might look butchered and you 
load it into the solver and what the hell is this  
guy thinking but really he's just having this 
exploitative thought process and not giving his  
opponent credit for being computer and suddenly it 
makes sense so yeah hope you guys enjoyed the hand  
and Analysis uh let me know what you think in the 
comments and I'll see you guys next time [Music]
