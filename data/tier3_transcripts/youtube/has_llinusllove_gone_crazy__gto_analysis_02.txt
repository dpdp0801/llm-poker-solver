### TOPIC: gto analysis
what's up youtube i'm money j2k with gto
wizard
and i'm back with another linus love
hand review this one was a ten
thousand dollar pod at 25.50 and it's
got some fireworks on the river
all right so the hand starts out with us
opening the button with ten seven of
hearts to 126 dollars
big blind calls the big blind is born to
tilt he's a very respectable 25.50 pro
he's been on joey ingram's podcast he's
definitely someone to look out for
flop is queen queen eight rainbow big
blind's not gonna have any dunks so born
to tilt range checks
linus is going to be betting range here
biting one about one third
linus does born to tilt calls turn is
the ace of diamonds
a pretty equal turn both players are
going to have some trips both players
are going to have some 8x both players
are just going to have some ada asex
born to tell checks linus checks backs
he's got 10
high i think this could mix in some bets
just because we're going to want to
want to be bluffing this turn quite a
lot because we're going to have a lot of
trips we're going to have a lot of asex
and whatnot
rivers the king of clubs born to tilt
puts in a 2x over bet
linus ships it for 3 725 dollars more
and born to tilt calls born to tilt as
jack 10 off so obviously a pretty
standard play from born to tilt
however linus's play is quite
interesting there's
he's got the 10 blocker but we're not
quite sure what our best bluffs are
going to be here
hearts are probably good but this is
what we got gto wizard for so let's jump
in
so now that we're in gto wizard we can
start to analyze how the ranges interact
so just as a reminder this is button
versus big blind single race pot
flop is queen queen eight rainbow going
to the equity graph we can
pretty quickly see that the button has a
pretty drastic advantage all the way
across
from the bottom end all the way up to
the very top end however
the top end of the ranges actually
become very close
both players have quite a lot of trips
so the
overall trip counts the button is going
to have slightly more as you can see
but the big blind definitely has a lot
of trips so this is going to be one of
those
interesting flops where the the big
blind actually has
pretty close equity at the top end of
the ranges however the big blind is
still losing pretty drastically at the
bottom end of the ranges
the big part where the buttons overall
range advantage comes from
is going to come from basically full
house quads
over pairs and under pairs if we look at
just these these combos
the button has 7.2 percent whereas the
big blind has none
and so basically what that means is
that's that's that's right here on the
equity graph that's where this
largest different differential is
between the button and the big blinds
ranges
and you can see where this is this is a
very drastic advantage the but the big
line just doesn't have these hands
big line really doesn't have that many
boats either like pocket eights in queen
eight
and so what this results in is when we
go to the strategy tab
we see that the button bets his entire
range
buttons betting 94 of the time he mixes
in some of these larger sizes
but i think as human players we can
simplify this to just range betting for
a third pot
and not lose any ev so once we go here
we put in the 27 bet the big blind is
playing
quite mixed here so the big blind's
going to be mixing in a lot of
a lot of these trip hands between
raising and calling
and a lot of these these 8x hands are
also going to be whereas ace 8 is
raising the most obviously
and going down the 8x is going
progressively down raising less and less
it is going to be really really merged
we're going to see bluffs like pocket
twos and pocket threes and 97 and 9
6 and jack 9 and 10 9 and jack 10 and
king 10 there's just there's a lot of
different bluffs here and it's going to
be very very merged
one of the things to note is when we
filter for the folding range it's
actually
a lot it's it's actually very important
when we go to these later streets
that these low end hands get folded
because if we go to the button
if we go to the button strategy here the
button still has all of these very low
equity hands whereas the big blind got
to fold all of those on the flop so once
we start looking at the turns and the
rivers
it's going to be really interesting how
that's going to interact so let's go to
a turn
big blind calls turn is the ace of
diamonds
and so the big blind is checking range
here he's not going to be donking very
much
and the reason the big blind's not going
to be docking is fairly intuitive
the equity actually runs very very close
on this board
and so the big blind is going to have to
check to balance his checking range
quite a lot here
and so on the turn we can start to see
trips
now the big blind is actually at a
slight advantage in trips
this is mainly because the big blind's
number of combos went down
so as a general density of his range the
trips has become a higher density
that's why he only has 13 combos of
trips however
it's 10.3 percent of his total range now
this is just because
the big lens range got split up on the
flop so the big blind may
have folded some some of these some
combos he raised some combos and so now
the overall combos that the big one has
is drastically less than what he had on
the flop so
now he may have um a higher he has a
higher density of trips overall
and another thing to note in the trips
area
is the button has some of the higher
trips he has some of the king queen
suited the queen jack suited as well
where the queen jack off and the big
blind doesn't have as many of these
the big blind is mainly having these
lower queen x because these higher queen
x raise the flop
and so when we go over to the strategy
tab we can really start to see
that the button is mixing quite a lot
here
again the button is betting roughly 60
of the time
the button is not over betting and that
just comes down to this equity graph
again
where the top end of the equity graph is
actually pretty close
so we don't have this really large nut
advantage and so we're not going to be
wanting to over bet and trying to really
push a nut advantage because our nut
advantage just doesn't exist
and so when we put in when we put in the
check
river the king of clubs and this is
where the hand gets really interesting
and so the big blind is definitely using
a lot of these over bets here
and that is mainly because his hands
need to get some money in
some of these really good hands like
queen 2 and queen 3 fans like queen 8
suited hands like
king queen now the low frequency that he
has it as well as the low frequency that
he has pocket eights
it's gonna be really important for him
to get money in the middle
and so when we filter for this over bet
range we can see it's a lot of these
trip hands a lot of these
um a lot of a lot of these boats as well
so these hands
really need to get the money in like i
said and so he definitely is going to
want to have an over bet range
it's also important to note that he has
the smaller range and this just goes
back to the equity graph where
now if we look at the equity graph the
big blind actually
has a pretty significant advantage now
the big blind has 54
equity whereas the button has 46 equity
and we can see that it's pretty much an
overall range advantage
the button has some spots and some
points where he has an advantage but for
the most part the big blind's going to
be at an
advantage so what this means is he's
going to have some hands that are able
to go for thin value and some hands that
are able to go for some
um really big values so as we can see
his best hands
big blind has 39.2 percent of best hands
and the button has 23.6
and so we can just see that the big
blind now now that the button split his
turn range between bets and checks now
the big
the the button is now significantly
weaker on the river and now the big
blind
moves the advantage moves towards the
big blind so the big blind can now have
a pretty high bet frequency
as we go back to the strategy tab big
line is overall betting
50 of the time but he's mixing mixing in
some of these pretty large over bets as
well
and so once the big blind puts in this
over bet
now the button spot gets quite
interesting and so the button
actually does have a good a good chunk
of boats here
so the button has aces and kings he also
has queen eight he has ace queen he has
king queen he has ace queen as well it
also has a very very low frequency of
pocket eights
now that means that he's going to want
to have a jamming range
now the the button is only calling
40 of the time or only defending 40 of
the time
and his calls are a lot of bluff
catching kind of calls so he's calling
some of these asex and whatnot
as total bluff catchers he's calling
even some 8x as total bluff catchers
just because the big blind is mainly not
going to be bluffing
he's not going to be bluffing any pairs
and so jack 8 is going to be
all the bluffs and he's going to lose at
all the value so that makes jackie an
exact kind of uh bluff catcher he also
has
a jack so that jack is blocking hands
like jack 10
and so he makes an even better bluff
catcher
and then these asexual have very similar
properties where they beat
all of the bluffs but lose all the value
and
all of these trips these lower end trips
are also going to mix between raising
and calling
these these are just just marginally
good enough to raise
but also good enough to call they're not
getting called by a lot worse when they
raise
and they're winning a lot when they when
they do call so they can mix between
both
and now once we start looking at our
bluffs we can start seeing the highest
frequency bluffs
are tens and jacks actually and so tens
and jacks makes the most sense because
when we go back to the big blinds range
the big one really didn't have
that many boats he only has
he only has point six percent of his
range as boats however a lot of his
range is straights and when we
filter by the by the over um by the over
bet
we can see that jack 10 is is the best
hand
in that range and a lot of these trips
end up
folding when we jam over the top so
these trips are actually not too bad for
him to have when we're looking at it
from the buttons perspective
and so the main thing that we want to
block is jack tin
because he doesn't have very many boats
and so we don't need to be
we don't want to be blocking like we
don't want to have an eight or an
ace or a king just because he doesn't
really have pocket eights he doesn't
really have queen eight suited very much
he doesn't really have any of these
hands
so having a pair when we're choosing
these bluffs isn't really going to be
necessary
we're going to want to double block the
straight because that's going to be the
main part of his calling range so pocket
jacks and pocket 10s are going to be the
best bluffs
now we get to some of these mixed
frequency kind of bluffs here
so we start getting to our exact hand 10
7 of hearts and this is what makes
linus really interesting and really
really good at what he does
this is a very low frequency raise
however
it is a raise and so we don't really
know whether linus is rng the spot
whether how he's playing this spot
overall
maybe he's over bluffing the spot maybe
he's under bluffing the spot maybe he
rolled a hundred
and he was only gonna bluff this one out
of a hundred times but this time he
decided to rng it and he he got there
but
the fact of the matter is ten seven of
hearts is a bluff
may only be seven percent of the time
however it's a bluff so
why is ten seven of hearts chosen over
ten seven of spades and ten seven of
clubs
mainly this is because when we go back
to the flop he's calling a lot of these
backdoor flush draws so he's calling a
lot of spade
double spade draws he's calling double
double diamonds double clubs
and he's not going to be calling 107 of
hearts the other reason this is is he's
going to have some queen ten of hearts
and the ten of hearts blocks a couple
extra combos of trips
where he can't have queen ex queen
exospades
he can't have queen diamonds of spades
but he can't have some
queen heart x so blocking queen ten of
hearts as well as queen seven of hearts
can be a pretty good thing especially
because a lot of the queen 10 might be
calling
at some frequency so we're blocking some
calling ranges
so overall hearts are going to be
greatly preferred over clubs
diamonds and spades just because they
unblock the backdoor flush draws
and remember we checked back the turn so
all of these backdoor flush draws that
called the flop
they're still in the big blinds range so
he's still going to have all these
backdoor flush draws that get to fold
the river and he might be putting some
of these backdoor flush draws into the
overbet range
as mixing in some of these bluffs
and so some of the other hands that are
low frequency bluffs hands like jack 4
hands like jack 5 but mainly the heart
combos the club combos are very small
low frequency as well
but mainly all of these hands are going
to be using the the heart combos
and so overall the the button is mainly
going to be wanting to have a jack or a
10 because it wants to bat jack
it wants to block jack 10 and it wants
to block the straights and so
the primary bet the primary bluffs is
going to be pocket jacks and pocket tens
and so once we put in the all in
now the big blind actually plays quite
nitty here
and so as as we can see the big blind is
folding
a lot of trips he's folding most of his
trips actually
about 77 of his trips are folding here
and that's mainly because
all these trips are bluff catchers when
we go back to the buttons range
he's not really betting these low trips
very often the main part of his range
is is boats ace queen and and pocket
kings and pocket aces
as well as these these higher trips like
queen jack and queen 10
and so these low um these these low
queen x
are actually pretty much pure bluff
catchers they're not beating a lot of
value
especially when you have the queen it's
very very unlikely
that your opponent has that last queen
in the deck
it's much more likely that your opponent
has pocket aces or pocket kings or
pocket eights
and so you end up running into a boat
slightly more often than you really
should in the overall range just because
of your blocker effects
now the big blind's primary part of his
calling range is going to be
these these boats with queen eight
pocket eights king queen
and jack 10. now
jack 10 is is obviously the hand that we
were trying to block the most and the
hand that born to tilt had
so he calls so in conclusion
the primary part for the buttons range
is he wants to be bluffing pocket jacks
he wants to be blocking pocket tens
because he wants to block jack 10.
the button also wants to have hearts
because he unblocks some of those
backdoor flush draws
and some of the best things we can learn
from these kind of spots is starting to
understand
what we need to think about when we're
in game and trying to choose our best
bluffs
the most important thing is realizing
that all of these hands were
lower frequency bluffs even pocket jacks
and pocket tens
weren't pure bluffing even our best
bluffs were only betting
roughly 27 to 50 percent of the time
they
you need to make sure that you're rng in
these spots because it's going to be
really important
that you don't just send every single
potential bluff you
you can also see all these lower
frequency bluffs were less than five
percent or so
and so i think the best thing that we
can all learn from these kind of spots
is understanding the principles and what
kind of blockers we want
when we want which blockers which suits
are the best
and we can really use programs like gtl
wizard in order to start to understand
and get a large sample size on
all a lot of different river jam spots
and river bluff phrases and whatnot
and so hopefully this video is really
helpful leave a like i'm going to be
doing these videos hopefully every week
we're also going to be doing some
gto theory videos as well so look out
for those
thank you
you
