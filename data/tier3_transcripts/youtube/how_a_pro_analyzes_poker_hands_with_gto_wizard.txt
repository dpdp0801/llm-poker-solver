### TOPIC: poker hand analysis
hey everyone in this video I'm going to go over 
the hand history analyzer if you're looking to  
improve your game this is going to be the tool 
that's going to take you to the next level
so first I'm going to show you guys how to upload 
your hands using the analyzer tool it's very  
simple all you have to do is go to the top of the 
page here and you'll see an analyze button you'll  
get two drop downs uploads and hands right up here 
and all you have to do is click on the uploads in  
order to upload a hand history or a file to GTA 
wizard all you have to do is find a location where  
you save your file I save mine on the desktop so 
it's fairly easy for me to just take the file from  
the desktop that I save my hand histories to and 
go to the upload section and you'll see a little  
window here comes up that you can click and paste 
your hand history for the single hands but if you  
want to upload a file you can just click the files 
button and you can just take this file and drag it  
right into the upload section here and GTA wizard 
will upload the file and analyze it within a few  
hours if not sooner so once all of the files are 
uploaded you'll see that we get to this page here  
uh this is where it's going to tell you all of the 
total hands that were uploaded how many correct  
plays you made how many wrong plays you made and 
what's your average EV loss was so when you're  
looking through these statistics um just keep in 
mind that there's a few caveats to GTO wizard one  
the analyzer cannot analyze multi-way scenarios so 
you're not going to be able to analyze multi-way  
spots like four-handed or three-handed post-flop 
another caveat is that certain stack depth aren't  
supported so if you're playing like 500 big blinds 
deep you're not going to see an option for that in  
GTA wizard so typically the analyzer is going to 
be able to analyze anything from roughly 200 big  
blinds a little bit over and down so if you have 
any hands where you played a heads up scenario  
versus another player at about 200 big blinds or 
down it'll come up in the analyze uh into the yeah  
into the analyzer so this is the session that I 
played today uh right here you can see the date  
and the name of the file that I used to upload 
the amount of hands uh and then how many hands I  
played correct and how many mistakes I made and 
what my average EV loss was so I've been using  
this tool for a really long time uh almost around 
the time that GTO wizard even came out and you can  
see I have a lot of hands in the database already 
that I've just been uploading because every day I  
upload my hands and every day I look through all 
of my mistakes and see what I can do better so  
I've already had close to 440 000 hands uploaded 
and you can see here that my it tells me what my  
average correct plays are what my wrong plays 
were and what my average EV loss was um and so  
the way that I use this Tool uh is I look over all 
of the hands and I sort uh between what my biggest  
average EV losses hands were what the biggest 
pots that I played were and uh any hands that I  
marked during the session or thought about trying 
to look at later for review so let's open up the  
first file here that I analyzed which was today's 
session it'll bring you to another page here which  
is just your analyzed hands so like I said you can 
sort them for different things you can sort them  
for uh the date you played the status what site it 
was if you're you know uploading multiple files or  
something like that uh what the format was EV loss 
big blinds one loss so that's going to be if you  
want to sort for big pots the pot size if you just 
want to sort for a big pot in general not whether  
you want it or lost it just how big the pot was 
you know what your position was and what cards you  
had and what board textures there were and what 
actions there were so there's a lot of different  
um things here but you are going to only be able 
to sort between the Eevee loss the big blinds one  
loss the pot and the others are just going to tell 
you exactly you know what the position was or who  
the hero was Etc so looking at the first thing 
EV loss you can click here and you'll see that  
it'll automatically sort all of your hands to the 
biggest EV loss that you experienced during the  
session so you can see the first hand that pops 
up at the top here I lost negative 4.18 so this  
is a pretty big EV loss which means I probably 
made a big blunder in the hand and if I want to  
check how I played the hand I can click on it here 
and it'll bring up the hand history on the right  
so once you get the hand history here you can 
go through the actual hand and see where your  
mistake was we're going to go over some actual 
hands that I played in a minute but first I  
just wanted to continue to show you how else you 
can sort the uh the hands to to look at later on  
so that's the EV loss that you can sort you 
can also sort to see if you made any good plays  
um but typically I would just use this tool 
to uh sort for the big mistakes and then go  
over the mistakes this particular session I 
didn't have too many mistakes so it's it's  
actually going to be easier for me to review 
this session than looking at the big blinds  
one or lost so like I said you can sort for your 
bigger costs that you played so I played a bunch  
of big pots you can see here I won a pot that was 
300 big blinds today and I can also I also want  
another pot that was 284 big blinds so pretty 
good session today um if I sort for the path  
that I lost you can see the biggest pot I lost 
was 34 big blinds so again yeah lucky session  
um not a lot of variance in this one but I do 
want to sometimes look at these medium sized  
pots as well it's not always just going to be 
important to look at the top uh positive one and  
the top posit you lost also you can look through 
some of the middle uh the middling stack pots  
you know depending on what you want to look 
through and then again you can just put up the pot  
um function here and you can see 
when there was a huge pot played  
in the games you were in this doesn't 
necessarily include you in the hand so  
it's important to note that if you do sort 
by pot it's not going to include your actual  
um your actual action it's going to just 
be two players played a big pot together  
so that's why I like to either sort by the 
Eevee loss or the big blinds one and lost  
um those are going to be the two main ones 
that I use so let's take a look at how I  
analyze the hands after they're analyzed okay 
first hands I pull up here I like to always  
open the replay hand function here because it 
just gives you a bigger view of what's going on  
um and it also gives you this nice little 
UI here to show you all of the different  
options that you could have used so for this 
scenario looks like the button opened we had  
Ace queen off suit and we go for a three bet 
I've modeled my game to represent What wizard  
uses and sizes so I'm typically going to use 
the same sizings that wizard uses but if you  
use a different size that's okay because 
wizard will adjust your play to fit What  
wizard is going to do so let's say you raised to 
10 BBS out of the big blinds but wizard wants to  
use a 13 big blind sizing it'll adjust your 10 
big blinds to the 13 big blinds that wizard is  
using you can also change what Solutions you 
would use in the options menu as well if you  
wanted to use different options you can go up 
to the settings and you can see the analyzer  
and you can choose which hands you want to use 
or which Solutions rather that you want to use  
for the analyzer so if you're studying with um 
something like 50 and L simple you can use that  
for the hand history and analyzer and it'll upload 
all of the hands assuming that you want to play  
The nl50 Simple Solutions so personally I use the 
500 General as I mostly play 500L online I also  
mix in some 200 NL as well so I think if you're 
going to play 200 or 500 the best Solutions are  
going to be the 500. if you play something like 
100 or 50 NL then I would suggest using the 50  
NL Solutions and if you play anything under 50 NL 
then 50 and L is going to be the solutions for you  
um so yeah I typically use the general 500 and 
like I said I modeled my game to represent all  
of the sizings that wizard is going to use so 
you can see I raised the 13 big blinds as I  
know wizard likes to use a 13bb Rays out of 
the big blind versus button in the scenario  
um and villain four bets to 28 so we're gonna 
mix between call and shove here uh I didn't  
actually know that I can shove versus the button 
in this scenario so that's something I'm already  
kind of taking note in my mind um also the fact 
that the fold option is zero EV uh that was also  
a surprise to me I didn't think I was going to be 
able to fold but you can see the little blue here  
in the bar representing the fold frequency which 
means that if you have a button that's going to  
be uh for betting very tight ranges and not enough 
weekends this might be a really good candidate to  
just three bet fold against that player so yeah we 
uh we end up calling and seeing a flop flop is Ace  
King six I go for the check that's good so you can 
just go forward in the hand to see every single  
part of the hand and see where you made a mistake 
or didn't make a mistake so so far no mistakes  
made we kind of learned a couple of things about 
the frequency of Ace Queen offsuit pre-flop  
and uh villain bets a what looks to be 
around 33 sizing which is a bit large  
um since GTO wizard is typically going to 
want to use a 25 sizing in this scenario  
um so that's that's represented by the white here 
where it says bet 25 and then in the parentheses  
is what the sizing the villain actually used 
so again uh wizard is going to take that sizing  
and try and fit it into the sizings that it 
already has for the solutions that being said  
if a villain uses a different sizing the 
hand history analyzer will still show you  
the proper uh frequency versus that sizing but 
if you wanted to dive deep into the hand and  
open up the spot which you can do here with this 
button you'll see that when you open up the spot  
um it defaults to the 25 sizing that the 
button ended up uh you know was supposed  
to use according to the solutions 
of GTA wizard so I'll get to the  
um I'll get to the spot analysis in a minute 
but going back to the hand in question
um in the spot we'll continue versus the 33 
percent so we're assuming this is a 33 uh bet  
so against that we can call we can also shove I 
elected the call and then the turn we turn the nut  
flush draw uh with the Queen of Diamonds I check 
button decides to check back and I went all in  
um this was a spot that in game I kind of thought 
maybe I should have a smaller sizing and an all-in  
sizing um but it looks like wizard doesn't really 
want me to have an all-in sizing here uh and to  
check whether or not I should have an all-in 
sizing I can go and click study the spot again  
and then we can take a look at the range that 
wizard in fact wants to go all in with and we  
can look here there's a 5.4 percent frequency 
of going all in so it's not uh it's not zero but  
um the combos that we're going to go all in 
with don't include the ace queen with the queen  
and I think this might have something to do with 
the fact that we're blocking a lot of the calling  
range uh from villain with the Ace in our hand uh 
because if you see here I assume if big blind goes  
all in that the button is going to have to call 
a lot of Ace X Combos and that's where we get our  
value from from the flush so we can click call 
here and then it'll highlight all of the calling  
hands and you can see like I was saying uh a lot 
of the calls are going to come from hands like  
Ace King Ace 8 A7 ace3 ace2 all having that 
Ace that we actually are blocking in our hand  
so we're not going to get a lot of calls when 
we're blocking the range that villain is gonna  
call with makes sense um so it looks like wizard 
Alexa to mostly check my combo in particular  
um and in I guess in hopes that you know 
the villain is going to have some of the  
Bluffs that they're going to have so if we 
check here then button is going to have to  
Bluff at a certain frequency you know hands like 
Queen nine of Hearts is even in their range here  
um you know a lot of different combos are going 
to have to Bluff the river and we're not blocking  
those combos with uh with our Ace of Spades or our 
Ace of uh whatever we had uh so we're unblocking  
the Bluffs we're blocking the hands that are 
mostly going to check back like a state A7  
um and then even sometimes Ace King can even 
shove so if they do have those combos they're  
gonna shove anyway so the times that we shove and 
are blocking those calls and they have to fold  
um and the times that we check and they have 
to shove those hands that's just going to be  
a better uh EV play for our particular holding 
with the Queen of Diamonds even though we have  
the nuts it's going to prove to be better to check 
in that scenario so looking at like another hand  
let's pull up this one here this is pocket threes 
on the cutoff and it looks like we are going to  
be analyzed for a deeper scenario so you can 
tell what the scenario is solved for by looking  
over here underneath the pre-flop section so 
you can see that the solver used the 200 big  
blind solutions for this particular hand because 
cutoff was played with the button and we're both  
uh pretty deep stacked here so this is what I was 
saying earlier by sometimes you can still use the  
200 big blinds uh solution for a 250 big blind 
scenario but just keep in mind that it's going  
to be a bit inaccurate especially if there's 
some scenario where you just end up shoving  
all of your chips GTO wizard might simplify 
that to try and fit the 200 big blind solution  
so looking through this one we open the 
cut off button three bets and at 200 Big  
steep we're just never folding threes uh 
we're pretty much continuing with any pair  
so I end up calling here and we flop a set 
pretty dream scenario for deep stack spot  
um I end up checking and villain bets small uh 
first off I'm really curious about villain's  
small bet here I'm not sure that villain wants 
to be sizing down this much in position on a  
board texture like this um I think this sizing 
is more fit for some other scenarios but because  
we're so deep stacked I could see this maybe 
being good as well but if I wanted to double  
check it again I'm going to open up the spot um 
tool and I can go through and look back at what  
the button wants to do in the scenario and so 
you can see here the button is mostly going to  
use a 50 sizing a 33 sizing and very rarely a 
20 sizing which is what villain used I believe  
uh if I'm not mistaken let me double check here 
what did they use let's go back to the uploads
and pull up the hands so it looks like if I look 
in the hand history yeah uh villain used about a  
28 sizing in practice so it simplified it to 
the 33 size that uh GTO wizard wants to use  
so that's probably fine not a big mistake there 
if uh villain went a little smaller than the 28  
sizing I could see that being a mistake because 
it's a very low frequency play Here by wizard  
given the option and so the mistake that we 
actually made was we just flat called here  
in game I thought this would be a good spot 
to uh have some really strong hands out of  
position to be calling with especially since this 
board texture is very Dynamic a lot of different  
draws can come in on turn river that make pocket 
threes uh no good and so I thought we could have  
some really strong hands in our range for check 
calling out of position and what better hands to  
check call with than sets especially bottom set 
because there is even some reverse implied odds  
that we end up check raising here and getting it 
inverse nines or tens and get stacked so I thought  
that if there was going to be a hand to slow play 
out of position it would be one with a lot of  
vulnerability that still has a lot of strength 
and can continue to call multiple streets but  
uh yeah alas I think the solver wants us to just 
push this and raise the 100 sizing a lot of the  
time so I made a mistake there but it wasn't 
exactly a huge mistake if you look at the EV  
you can see all of the EV for the different 
options and call was just barely below raise 100  
and raise 60. um and so you'll often see if the EV 
is close to the same that the solver is going to  
use a bunch of different options but in this case 
the call option is just a bit too low compared to  
the other raise options and so it mostly wants 
to just raise in this scenario so because the  
EV was still close uh GTA wizard classifies 
this as an inaccuracy so there's a certain  
threshold for inaccuracies before they become 
blunders and blunders are the biggest mistakes  
that you can make and that's something you don't 
want to be doing in the hand so an inaccuracy is  
um is pretty close but uh still not 
going to be a line the solver is going  
to use so they might not be at the top 
priority for you to try and fix in your  
game but it is important to not make too many 
inaccuracies because of course they do add up  
so turn um I ended up checking in villain checked 
back and then I wasn't really sure what sizing  
scheme I wanted to use here on the river but it 
looks like the solver really wants us to go big  
we have a really strong hand now villains showed 
a lot of weakness we have the top of our range  
you know villain could still have some asex that 
caused this huge bet with and I really like that  
the uh the solver wants to use the 300 sizing I 
thought about that in game but because I wasn't  
really sure I just went with the large size 
and so I ended up betting 71 which this was a  
blunder you can tell the EV is a lot different 
here and we're losing a decent amount of EV if  
we're only betting this small sizing so this 
was the spot where I picked up a mistake and  
I would in the future be more sure to use the 
more polar sizings when my opponent in position  
shows some weakness and I have an uncapped 
range that has a lot of really strong hands
um so now that we've looked at a couple of the top 
EV losses let's look at one of the biggest pots  
that I played we can look at something like this 
so This is actually a very unique scenario because  
this was against the recreational player so I'll 
show you guys how wizard looks at some of the  
um sub-optimal sizings used in game so first off 
hijack opens to 3x which is not typically a sizing  
that wizard is going to use so again it's going 
to adjust it to the 2.5 x and then for us we're  
supposed to be three betting to about 10 BBS in 
position because we are deeper on the button so  
I missed this size as well I could have went to 
10 BBS but instead in game I went to eight BBs  
so I3 bet to 8 hijack calls flop I don't think 
there's going to be a lot of leading from the  
hijack so this again isn't really a scenario 
that's used by GTO wizard but that's okay because  
it can uh resolve for the sizing that's used and 
you'll see the response that we are supposed to  
take to an approximate level so it's not going 
to be perfect like it would be if villain used  
a decision that was an actual strategy in GTO 
wizard but because they ended up just leading  
something like 75 percent on the Flop or whatever 
it was they LED there is no option for that as you  
can see here most of the time hijack is just 
going to check so uh going back to the hands
you'll see that villain in fact did just kind of 
lead half pot here but wizard is still going to  
have an answer now like I said this isn't going 
to be a super accurate answer but it's going to  
give us a good enough approximation of what we 
should be doing here so you can tell that EV is  
different even though um the strategy is uh split 
which isn't usually the case if there's a higher  
EV option like this usually the solver is going 
to just pick this at a pure frequency but because  
um this isn't going to be solved to the accuracy 
that the other solution and strategies are it's  
an approximation once again so that's why we 
see the difference in EV but the the solver  
wants to mix these two uh decisions and then 
so it's it's something like a solver noise if  
you've heard that term before so again just 
make sure you're analyzing this with caution  
so I ended up calling and then on the turn again 
I could have mixed between raise and call but I  
decided call so again there's still some you 
know this this isn't really a thing in in GTO  
wizard so we have this unique scenario and then 
by the river villain just shoves so at this point  
um you can see that the EV is close to zero on 
both decisions um we're facing what we think  
is approximately a hijack range for leading 
three streets um but what it came down to was  
I thought I was blocking the nuts with the Ace of 
Spades we have a really strong hand here if we're  
folding this hand we're probably just folding 
everything except for a flush or trips which  
um you know I think that's a bit exploitable uh 
so I decided to make the call here and luckily  
a villain just showed up with a random Ace Queen 
offsuit uh and I was happy to see that and ship  
the pot but using the hand history analyzer just 
be careful when you see a lot of sizings that are  
out of the norm the accuracy might not be uh 
completely reliable the times that you want to  
use the hand history analyzer and really go into 
depth is when villain is using approximate sizings  
that are close to GTO wizard as well as you're 
using the strategy as well and you'll get a really  
good scenario to study and better your play lastly 
let's put it all together and look at a hand that  
we lost some EV in and how we're going to learn 
from that and adjust in the future so we're going  
to sort by EV loss once again and we'll take 
this pocket Eights hand as a option there we go  
okay so pocket eights in the hijack we open 
to two big blinds you can see that this was  
solved for 100 BBS I think filling used some very 
similar sizings to GTA Wizards so that's great  
um flop Jack 4 against the big blind we 
go ahead and see bets we're supposed to  
see bet at a pretty high frequency here um so 
we do and I get check raised um it looks like  
we don't have too many other options other 
than just call which is what I end up doing  
and turn as a six of Spades villain goes ahead 
and Bets again at half pots now this is a sizing  
I think I wasn't ready to see I thought villain 
would polarize a bit more um on the turn because  
they're effectively representing that they have 
trips but they do have some weaker hands in their  
range for check raising the Flop like pocket 
sevens pocket sixes now that makes a boat but  
on the Flop they could have uh check raised 
some weaker hands that maybe you want to go  
for a smaller sizing so let me look at what sizing 
wizard wants to use after it check raises the flop  
um so wizard looks to check raise the Flop and 
then on the turn the big blind is mostly going  
to mix between uh 75 50 33 and 175 those are 
going to be the most common sizings right here  
uh so yeah villain did well it's about the 50 
sizing um and that leaves like I said their  
range a little less polar so they can have some 
more merged hands maybe they can even have some  
pocket Queens in this scenario um or something 
like pocket tens uh perhaps and we can double  
check that in the range here we can see that 
there's a small frequency of pocket tens or maybe  
villain wants to continue betting something like 
a flush draw some weaker trips even so something  
like Jack 5 suited so it doesn't really want 
to polarize yet with a big part of the range so  
it looks like we're using a lot of the 50 sizing 
so that's something that I'm going to learn next  
time I check raise a paired board out of position 
maybe I'm going to use a sizing like 50 percent  
um that's not so polar and then on the other 
side of the coin for us um it looks like  
we're going to just continue with eights at a 
pretty high frequency but with the diamond it  
looks like that hand wants to start mixing 
in some Folds so let's go back to the hand
so on the turn it looks like we have 
a fairly standard call but we can do  
some mix folding because again we're blocking 
this Ada diamonds which is going to block the  
weaker hands of big blind and typically you 
don't want to be doing that in this scenario  
now this is where I can learn something because 
clearly I made a bad fold against the small size  
um villain goes for the small size on the river 
which I thought was pretty interesting because  
uh villain can still have a lot of strong hands 
even with the sizing a lot of their flushes get  
there but also they have a lot of trips with 
like a weak kicker or even some merged hands  
in there that don't really want to be betting 
large so I assume that this sizing is going to  
contain a lot of weak trips with uh you know weak 
kicker and even some flushes I don't know if they  
have a large sizing so what I would first do 
is look again back at the sizing that is used  
by wizard so I'm learning that only my own 
play but also the play of the other player  
um so that I can mimic that in my own game it 
looks like the big blind does in fact not want  
to bet a large sizing here it only wants to 
bet a small sizing at a fairly high frequency  
so there is a lot of like weak trips here that 
want to be betting for Value but doesn't want to  
go for a large sizing since we can still have 
a flush we can still have better trips we can  
still have pocket kings or pocket sixes or pocket 
fours and so something like Jack five of hearts  
does not want to bet large but it still wants to 
get value from our weaker medium strength hands  
and then you have some you know flushes that 
are also weaker flushes uh and then you can  
even filter for some of the Bluffs if you want to 
take a look at the trash ends those are going to  
come up so hands like Queen ten of clubs look to 
be bluffing uh in this node so pretty interesting  
um this is something I would explore if I was 
curious okay well if they're betting the sizing  
like what are they bluffing right like what 
do their Bluffs look like I would come over  
to here into the filters look for the weekends 
look for the trash hands highlight those click  
on the sizings that are most often used and then 
kind of go through the Combos and try and find  
some heuristics for what hands I think uh make 
sense as a bluff right so if we see here Queen  
Santa clubs is a pretty high frequency Bluff that 
makes sense to check raise the flop because we had  
the back door uh straight and flush draws with the 
Jack of clubs on the board and then it looks like  
it just wanted to continue bedding here um and 
then once the the flush comes in you know we need  
some Bluffs that are not going to be diamonds 
so this one actually makes a lot of sense to  
Bluff because uh it's probably blocking hands that 
we're gonna call with like Queens with a diamond  
um and we can double check what exactly the combos 
are that it's blocking so if we go to 10 here and  
then we go to my calling frequency we'll see the 
hands that I'm calling or raising uh whether or  
not the Queen of Clubs is an important card 
right so we can go look through the Queens  
so here's one of the combos I was talking about 
Queens with a club and a diamond that's going to  
do a lot of calling so we're blocking that um 
from the range as the big blind and then also  
um let's see anything else looks like Queen 
jack off suit uh that's also going to be uh  
in the range of the hijack so we're blocking 
that combo which is really good so anytime  
we're blocking the hijacks calls as the 
big blind that's going to be a pretty  
good hand to Bluff right so again the Queen 
of Clubs is really blocking these combos here  
um Queen jack off suit and queen queen 
these make up a big portion of the range  
um and so if we're blocking those it's more 
likely that they're going to have something  
that they're folding and then of course since we 
only have Queen high as the big blind bluffing  
the 10 sizing we'll see that if we can get them 
to fold any pocket pairs here that's huge right  
um so that's really nice even though the sizing 
is only 10 percent you just you're gonna be stuck  
here with a combo that's going to have a difficult 
decision and you're going to get those combos  
to fold so nice spot for villains to size down 
on the river and that's something I'm going to  
take a note on to is when the board changes like 
that maybe I should have more of a smaller sizing  
and let's continue to look at how I played it 
so I should have called the small sizing on the  
river it looks like the EV isn't even close this 
is a big uh call I'm losing 1.6 EV by folding in  
this scenario I'm getting a great price and now 
we know that villain is capable of having some of  
those Bluffs so I really need to be calling hands 
like this especially one that's blocking the flush  
um it's blocking a lot of the value that villain 
could have had for check raising the Flop like  
Ace not ace 8 but uh something maybe like 10 8 of 
diamonds uh that was you know taking this line any  
of the flushes within eight of diamonds basically 
so I should have found the call here and we know  
the hands that they're supposed to Bluff and 
if you think that they're not in game then this  
might be a good adjustment to make some big folds 
on the river right like if you don't think that  
they're going to be bluffing hands like Queen ten 
of clubs on the on the river here then maybe it's  
better to just fold these hands that are closer 
decisions but in a perfect equilibrium we should  
have called and um I made a mistake here so that's 
something that I'm going to in the future make the  
call if villain is going to give me that uh 
proper sizing on the river and I think that  
villain is going to show up with enough Bluffs so 
to summarize how to use the hand history analyzer  
first you just upload your session whether it's a 
single hand you want to review or a full session  
you can upload either then you want to sort using 
the EV tool or the big blinds one or lost and then  
you can sort through all of your hands that way 
you want to look through the biggest mistakes and  
you want to analyze why you made the mistakes 
you want to make sure that all of the sizings  
that were used were the sizings that are used by 
GTO Wizard and you want to use all of the tools  
that you have on GTA wizard to analyze the hands 
so using you know all of the reports all of the  
data and anything that you want to learn you can 
dive deeper into so that you can understand why  
the solver is using the strategy that it's using 
that's probably the hardest one to get good at but  
we'll take you know like everything else time 
before you really understand how the solver  
thinks but then once you kind of get a good idea 
and hang of it then you'll be able to replicate  
how the solver plays in your own game and you'll 
also understand why so in order to better absorb  
all the new info it's important to take notes 
I always take notes after a study session if I  
have learned anything significant or if I've come 
across something that I didn't know previous and  
rinse and repeat you really just gotta grind it 
out and study all of the tools are available to  
you it's just a matter of whether you're going 
to be motivated and can get in that lab and  
work really hard because it's going to show and 
it's going to be very rewarding when you do look  
through your mistakes figure out why and then 
apply them next time they come up I don't think  
there's anything else that is more rewarding in 
poker than to better your game and continue your
