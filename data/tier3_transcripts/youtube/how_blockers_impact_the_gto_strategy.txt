### TOPIC: how blockers impact the gto strategy
hello wizards today we have a big update
for you we're releasing many new
post-flop solutions for cash games a new
blockers feature as well as many other
improvements
before we look at the blocker feature
let's see what else is covered by this
update for tournament players we've
added the aggregate flop reports for 20
and 60 big blind stack depths the only
reports missing now are 100 big blinds
which are coming soon we're also adding
all the missing spots for the mtt 20 big
line stack depth solutions for cache
game players we're releasing many new
post flop solutions we've added the
general 2.5 x 100 big blind stack depths
for both 50 and 500 nl rake structures
these are the same as the regular
general solutions but the opening size
has been changed to 2.5 big blinds we're
also releasing the nl50 cache gain
post-flop solutions for a variety of
stack depths including 200 big blinds
150 100 75 and 50 big blinds now you can
select your solution based on the actual
effective stack depth these new simple
solutions use a three bet or fold
strategy in all positions outside the
big blind the pre-flop 4-bet all-in is
disabled and there's no limping blind
versus blind these simplifications were
among the most requested by our users
500 nl version of these solutions with
all stack depths are coming soon please
note that the pre-flop solutions are
available for free starter users are
limited to the 100 big blind post-flop
solutions whereas premium users can view
post-flop solutions for all stack depths
with that we're also adding a new
ability to select which solutions you
use in the hand history analyzer so far
the hand history analyzer was limited to
500 nl solutions going forward you'll be
able to select your rake structure as
well as choose between the general or
simple solutions simply change your
preference in the game settings
the ability to save a spot in the
solution browser simply select the
floppy disk icon in order to save a spot
and find previously saved spots from
here you can add notes
stars and down the road we plan to add
the ability to sort and filter these
saved spots
we're adding a new combined view to see
bet sizes in both big blinds and pot
percentage at the same time now you
could choose one the other or both
simply press space to switch between the
views
remember you can always customize your
hotkeys in the hotkeys page
we're adding an alternative way to view
hand category data in the range
comparison tab
now you can choose between a centered or
stretched view go to your settings
and select this button here to switch
views this helps visualize the
differences in the ranges we've added a
new customization option that lets you
switch between black and white text in
the strategy matrix
this should help improve contrast and
visibility for those who are using
lighter themes
and now to the main feature of this
update lockers please note that this
feature is only available to premium
users each combination is assigned a
blocker score somewhere between 1 and 10
combos that block more ev in your
opponent's range are given a higher
blocker score there are three ways you
can view them
firstly you can select this drop-down
and select blockers
you can see each blocker is color-coded
according to its score
secondly
from the strategy table
we can see a little icon next to each
hand that indicates its blocker score
these shields are color coded according
to the score thirdly
we can see the blocker score in the
summary tab
so what are blockers what makes a hand a
good blocker
well you have to think about what your
hand wants for example
a value hand will likely want to block
less value in your opponent's range
that's because you want to get called by
these hands
so that's why
ace king with a diamond tends to bet
less often than ace king without a
diamond this is a value hand that wants
to get called so a low blocker score is
desirable if you're going to bet
bluffs have the opposite incentives
for example ace jack with a diamond has
a better blocker score it blocks more
value in the opponent's range and
therefore these hands tend to bet larger
and more frequently
if we look at the range as a whole we
can see that for example hand like kings
blocks a big chunk of big blind's value
range
therefore
it'll often prefer a smaller bet
hands like aces
blocks fewer value hands in villain's
range and is therefore more likely to be
called this hand prefers an overbet
let's say that the button over bets the
flop actions on the big blind we can see
hands that have a higher blocker score
tend to continue more often for example
ace 4 with the ace of diamonds is a pure
continue
whereas without the ace of diamonds it's
continuing less often
ends with the worst blocker score
like club hearts and spade heart
tend to continue the least often
you see a similar trend on queen nine
okay big blind calls and the turn is the
nine of clubs big blind checks actions
on button so again let me change this to
the blocker score
and
i wonder
which hands make a better bluff
on this run out i'm going to select
trash hands in the filters
we can see that for example
a jack or a 10
tends to block more value
than an ace
or one of these lower cards
we see that reflected in the strategy
these jack and ten hands tend to bluff
more often okay let's say that button
bets two-thirds pot
actions on the big blind
if you hold jack 10 here
you may want to think about raising and
we see the solver splits its range
between an all-in
and a smaller raise size
so
when it holds the jack of diamonds or
the ten of diamonds it has a higher
blocker score therefore it uses a
smaller raise on average
when you block less value in your
opponent's range
this nutted hand
likes to build in an over bet that's
because it expects to get called more
when it has a lower blocker score
the big blind calls
and we see a native club's record
big blind checks
actions on us on the button here the
button prefers the shove or check let's
say they shove
it's a big bet and actions on the big
blind to try and figure out which hands
make good calls
well let's take a look at the marginal
hands these top and second pair we can
see that hands which block the straight
for example
stuff with a 10 or a jack
tends to have a higher blocker score
than hands that don't block the string
furthermore and see more details in the
summary tab for example here queen 10 of
diamonds blocks the miss flush draw and
has a lower blocker score than other
queen
therefore
queen 10 without a diamond is more
inclined to call
so as you can see card removal is a
fundamental part of the gto strategy the
new blocker feature helps you understand
how much ev you block in your opponent's
range and leverage that to your
advantage
alright that's it for the video guys
