### TOPIC: how rake impacts your poker strategy
how does rake impact your strategy in poker 
most players don't realize that their strongest  
opponents are not the other players at the table 
but rather the house itself in today's lecture  
I'm going to show you how to minimize how much 
break you pay how to adjust your strategy for  
different rate structures and how rake impacts 
your win rate theoretically and in practice
hey everyone before we start the video 
we'd really appreciate it if you could  
hit the like And subscribe buttons your support 
means a lot to us thank you and enjoy the video  
in today's video I'm going to show you how to 
conquer the rake first and foremost I'll show  
you where to find free pre-flop charts for your 
specific rake structure we'll cover how rake  
impacts your strategy as well as your win rate 
we'll visualize rake as a utility function and  
then I'm going to show you some general post-flop 
adjustments you can make to improve your play at  
different rank structures the first question you 
should ask yourself is how can you find the best  
possible pre-flop charts for your rake structure 
luckily for you GTO wizard has just added a ton  
of different rake structures you can see we have 
solutions from Chip EV that's reckless all the  
way down to nl25 which is pretty high rake and 
everything in between see these Solutions open up  
the solution selector in the top left corner and 
select where you flop only solutions from here you  
can see we have various stack sizes complexities 
and rake structures to suit your needs you can  
even study different opening sizes if you're 
curious about the break percentage in cap select  
this preview icon you can see the rake is shown in 
this panel here the next question you should ask  
is how does rake impact your strategy to answer 
this question we're going to start reflop now  
generally speaking rake Hertz calling ranges but 
opening frequencies and raising frequencies stay  
about the same overall as we increase the rake we 
see more folding and less calling which should be  
obvious because well the rake cuts into your win 
rate but let me show you some examples of what I  
mean in this chart we're showing the opening 
frequency by position from under the gun at  
the top to small blind at the bottom now you'll 
notice that the opening frequencies stay about  
the same so for example under the gun is opening 
18 of their range at nl25 and they're opening  
19 of the range in chip EV and so it's very very 
close there's not a huge difference between chip  
PV and microstake solutions here there are some 
small changes as we get to the later positions  
of course but only about two percent or so and so 
okay if opening frequencies don't actually change  
that much then what about defense well defense 
changes a lot and this is what I mean when I say  
rake Hertz calling ranges this chart displays 
big blind strategy versus a 2.5 x button open  
at different rake structures at the top we have 
nl25 which has an 8 big blind cap at the bottom we  
have chip EV you can see as it goes from nl25 to 
nl100 nl500 and Chip EV are overall folding range  
increases and we're calling less often meanwhile 
our three bidding frequencies stay approximately  
the same in each spot let me show you an example 
I'm going to select these pre-flop Solutions again  
and we're going to use a 2X opening size and 
select chip EV cev so this means again Reckless  
here we're looking at under the gun's opening 
strategy in a reckless cash game and we can  
see that they open about 18.8 percent of hands 
how would their opening strategy change at 25 ml  
where there's a lot of rake 18.2 percent we can 
see there's really not a big difference between  
these two strategies the hand selection changes 
a bit but the overall frequency is very similar  
okay so what happens when under the 
gun opens and it folds the big blind  
well here we can see that they're defending 
about a third of their range at 25 in l  
but if there were no rake they would descend more 
than half their range it's a very significant  
difference there are two reasons for this the 
first is that rake is generally more leveraged on  
the player that's closing the action due to the no 
flop no drop rule so when big blind calls they're  
guaranteed to get raked whereas when under the gun 
opens they are not guaranteed to get raked because  
it can fold pre-flop right the second reason is 
that the big line just has more close decisions  
right many many more close decisions and this 
means that small changes to the expected value of  
their hands can have big changes on their overall 
defending frequencies here's another example so  
the button opens action folds the big blind and 
we can see again that the jpv solutions that is to  
say the rateless solutions will defend much wider 
compared to these high rake nl25 nl50 solution  
but something else changes you'll notice that the 
three-bed construction becomes much more linear  
in chip EV and much more polarized at nl25 the 
reason for this is because it's optimizing for  
different things at nl25 it's raising hands 
that are at the very bottom of your range  
that have good blockers and want to generate some 
fold Equity Queen Deuce king deuce asex these are  
all hands that are kind of crappy calls but they 
can generate a lot of folds if you three bet them  
and indeed when they do three bet you expect the 
button to fold quite often almost 70 percent now  
compare that to chip EV in a reckless game the 
button is expected to defend much wider facing  
a three bet and for that reason instead of 
optimizing for fold Equity it's optimizing for  
hands that do reasonably well when called suited 
connectors suited Broadways strong pocket Pairs  
and such now perhaps you're worried that this 
rebate size doesn't work for you well keep in mind  
you can always try these research Solutions which 
have many more three bet sizes and so you can see  
how the button responds to a range of different 
sizes again at various rake structures alright  
we've touched on some pre-flop strategy and I'll 
Circle back to strategy later in this presentation  
but first I think it's important to show you how 
rake impacts win rates so what I've done is I've  
graphed how much rake you pay at different stakes 
from GTO against measured hand history data the  
very top of this graph we see nl500 which has 
lower break you expect to pay approximately 3.3  
big blinds per hundred the very bottom of this 
graph we have nl10 with high rake and here you  
expect to pay about eight big blinds per hundred 
the blue lines represent your theoretical rake  
or how much a GTO solver thinks you ought to be 
paying overall whereas the red line represents  
how much rake you are actually paying according 
to measured hand history data so why is there such  
a big discrepancy at these lower Stakes it seems 
like players are paying much more rake than they  
ought to be paying according to what GTO thinks 
and I think the reason for this is that at lower  
Stakes players are not folding enough and just 
in general there's going to be more recreational  
players that are putting in too much money seeing 
too many flops and just pumping up the total  
amount of rake paid by the overall population 
whereas at the higher Stakes there are fewer  
recreational players players are a bit stronger 
and therefore the theoretical and actual rake  
get much closer the next most obvious question 
to me anyway was how did you to win rates vary  
by position how much should each seat win from 
under the gun through big blind and how do these  
vary by stake so I calculated these win rates from 
Chip EV nl400 and nl10 from under the gun through  
big blind first thing you'll notice is that the 
later positions pay a larger proportion of the  
rake on average and this is simply because they're 
playing more hands and therefore paying more rake  
for example under the gun we see that the win rate 
changes from 11 big blinds per 100 in a reckless  
scenario to eight big blinds per hundred micro 
Stakes whereas on the button we see that the win  
rate varies from 25 big blinds per 100 all the way 
down to 17 big blinds per hundred so there's a lot  
more variance here but all of that is dwarfed by 
how much more the blinds pay it appears that the  
blinds end up taking the runt of the rake I 
suppose because they are defended to continue  
the widest and play the most flops out of all of 
these positions the measured rake data from my  
previous graph was taken from this site Prime dope 
which is a great free online poker rate calculator  
I recommend checking this out they're not paying 
me to tell you this it's just a great little free  
tool so first of all you can see how much rake 
you would expect to be paying in big blinds per  
100 across different stakes and different formats 
at the very bottom here I particularly like this  
table which shows stakes from 10 NL all the way up 
to 500 NL and you can view this either as formal  
rake net rake or big blinds per hundred and here 
you can see that some sites are going to offer way  
better deals than other sites so it's important to 
scope out your competition even if you're limited  
to what sites you can play on you should scope 
out at what point you start to get a significant  
break on the rake in order to plan your bankroll 
management we can arm ourselves with knowledge  
all we want but to be honest the most direct way 
to pay less rake to pay less money to the house  
is just to get a good rate back and so rakeback 
allows you to reclaim a percentage of the rake  
paid typically contingent on putting in a certain 
amount of volume Scout could rig back deals online  
network with your poker friends and see what's out 
there don't just take the default amount learn to  
use some of the online tools like what I've just 
shown you and importantly I recommend looking for  
good deals before you create an account with the 
casino you can often get a better deal this way  
it should be noted that many casinos will try to 
obfuscate how much the rakeback is and sometimes  
it's hard to measure because it'll be in the form 
of loot boxes or Splash pots or whatever but in  
general you can usually figure out how much 
rake overall you're paying if you're tracking  
your hands it's important to realize that not all 
players will pay the same amount of rake generally  
speaking we can categorize how much rate you pay 
according to three factors one is your rate back  
deal two is how many flops you see and three is 
average size of the pot you're involved in and  
so payers to pay less rate will typically have 
a better rate back deal they'll play fewer flops  
which just means folding pretty more often 
or acting aggressively pre-flop and they'll  
Place smaller pots on average that means they're 
putting less money into the pot overall inversely  
here's the pay more rake might have no or a bad 
rate back deal they'll generally play more flops  
and just play larger pots on average so loose 
aggressive players generally are going to pay a  
lot lot more rake than titanity players which is 
why a lot of the winning regs at microstates are  
using kind of nitty strategy now with that said 
it's not always dependent on what strategy you're  
using if you're playing a GTO strategy against the 
maniac that Maniac can cause you to put in more  
money than GTO would otherwise just due to how 
your strategies interact and that can lead you to  
paying more rake overall just in general it's also 
important to realize that exploits against these  
types of players aren't fully benefiting you some 
of the ads you gain from exploiting a maniac goes  
to the house in the form of rake rather than in 
your pocket Okay so we've discussed how rake can  
impact your win rates but now I'd like to return 
to strategy let's focus on pre-flop Rake versus no  
flop no drop you play on a site like GG you get 
charged pre-flop rake if you play on most other  
sites there is a no flop no drop rule meaning 
you only get raked on parts that see a flop this  
creates different incentive tubes do three bets or 
call more pre-flop for example if there's no flop  
no drop you have more incentive to try and take it 
down immediately pre-flop before you get charged  
rake on that pot whereas in GG games there's 
typically a little bit less incentive to three  
bet pre-flop doesn't mean you should never three 
bet there's just less incentive because there's no  
longer that incentive to take it down immediately 
so to demonstrate this I'm going to show you two  
rake structures they're both five percent capped 
at three big blinds one is raked pre the other  
is not and we're gonna see how that changes your 
strategy in GTO wizard so here I've selected these  
pre-flop only research Solutions the research 
Solutions are kind of useful because they give  
you a ton of different race sizes so you can see 
what size the silver prefers given many options  
first I'm going to select these GG Russian 
cash Solutions and again these have a five  
percent rake to a three big blind cap we're 
going to compare this to nl100 which also has  
the same rake structure the only difference is 
that at nl100 no flop no drop rule is in effect  
whereas in GG Russian cash that is not the case 
now these look pretty similar but there's one  
huge difference and that is three bet sizing 
so here nl100 and then no flop no drop rule  
is in effect solver prefers much larger three bet 
sizes 12 13 14 big blinds even compare that to GG  
Russian cache where the solver prefers smaller Ray 
sizes nine big blinds 10 big blinds 11 big blinds  
and again the reason for this is that when the 
no flop no drop rule is in effect the solver will  
absolutely exploit that rule to try and pay less 
Rick it'll adjust its strategy to something that  
free bets large and often in order to take down 
the pot pre that can be difficult to visualize so  
I've made this chart to help you visualize it in 
blue we see GG pre-flop break and the other one is  
no flop no drop and we can see again a very clear 
preference for the no flop no drop solutions to  
three bet much larger out of the big blind facing 
a button open compared to GG rake and this is just  
kind of a general Trend you'll see in GG Solutions 
some of the marginal raises become calls and the  
reason is that they're simply less incentive to 
try and take it down pre through a three bet and  
so therefore they'll just call a bit more often as 
opposed to raise whereas with the no flop no drop  
rule the solvers will often prefer very large 
three-bed sizings out of position and kind of  
maneuver their strategy in such a way that it's 
largely focused on three better fold strategies  
facing an open next I'd like to visualize utility 
Theory now utility functions are something that  
alter the value of chips so in a cash game we 
can talk about rake in a tournament you could  
talk about ICM pressure these are both examples 
of utility functions that alter the value of what  
a chip is worth in general rake tends to lower 
the reward rather than the risk and so what we  
could do is we can see how rake percentage and cap 
changes our utility function by graphing our risk  
reward ratio at different stack depths let me 
show you what I mean in this chart I visualized  
your risk reward ratio against the size of the pot 
so this is The Rake utility function that's this  
area in green here now you don't have to worry 
about all of this math on the side that's just  
to make the chart interactive essentially the 
way you read this chart is the horizontal axis  
represents the size of the pot the vertical axis 
represents your risk reward ratio for example here  
the rake is five percent and this means that while 
you're in this region you're going to get about  
90 cents on the dollar now that may be confusing 
why are you getting 90 cents in the dollar when  
it's only five percent uh ten percent well it's 
because you risk for example in this case 20 big  
blind pot you and your opponent each put in 10 big 
blinds if you win that pot your net gain is nine  
big lines if you lose that pot your net loss is 
10 big blinds and so you're getting 90 cents on  
the dollar and this continues you keep getting 
90 cents on the dollar until you hit the cap  
and once you hit the cap you can start getting a 
discount when it comes to the risk reward ratio  
but we can see how this changes as we increase or 
decrease the rake structure for example if there  
was no rake you'd just get one to one you get 
one dollar on one dollar chip EV it's perfectly  
Fair now what happens is we increase that rate 
percentage so this is fifteen percent ten percent  
five percent and lower and we can see that it 
uh increases in this nice smooth geometric way  
okay so let's put that down to ten percent let's 
see how this changes as we vary the rate cap now  
this of course will change when we start getting 
that discount and as we increase the rate cap  
it becomes harder and harder to make a pot 
big enough that starts getting a good discount
so anyway if you want to try out this graph I'll 
link to it in the description the parameters are  
P for the percentage of rake paid and C for the 
rate cap in big blinds as shown in the middle of  
the graph here oh one thing to mention about this 
is that in general rake tends to be front loaded  
and what I mean by that is that um generally 
speaking you're going to get a better deal in a  
cash game when more of your stack is invested as 
opposed to you know down here when you're paying  
the full amount however in for example some of the 
micro Stakes places so for example this will be  
your average micro Stakes region you're just going 
to be paying the full amount either way all right  
that's enough utility Theory going forward I'm 
going to concentrate on how rake affects your  
strategy and win rate post flop here we see a 
button versus big blind single raised pot and  
I've graphed the rakes EV the expected value of 
the house at NL 500 nl50 and GG nl50 as a higher  
cap we'll notice something interesting here first 
of all the rakes win rate is is kind of absurd so  
the house is making 66 big blinds per 100 in this 
scenario that's a lot of big blinds okay so don't  
underestimate the rake probably a better way 
to view this a fair way is to craft the pot  
share rather than the big blinds per 100 because 
you know everything looks big when you multiply  
it by 100 so here we see the big blind's expected 
value as a percentage of the total pot on the left  
hand side and we can see it's 36 percent at all 
three rig structures on the right hand side we see  
buttons expected value and the rake is red in the 
middle and it looks like big blinds EV stays the  
same whereas The Rake is kind of eating into the 
buttons win rate and so one way to understand this  
is that the big blind is actually playing tighter 
at these high rake structures and so they're kind  
of Defending in such a way that they'll have 
exactly enough pot share post flop and so in  
exchange the button is going to take down more 
of these pots pre-flop and so we're not really  
seeing buttons pre-flop EV here we're only seeing 
Eevee when they get called by for example a tight  
range at these high rake structures perhaps it'll 
be clear with an example let me open GTO Wizard  
and show you how I generate these so from the 
solution selector again I'm going to select Bots  
that have post flop included because I'm doing 
a post-flop analysis and we'll just look at 100  
big blinds General Solutions comparing different 
rake structures all right so firstly let me show  
you how I get these values that I've shown you in 
the previous chart uh we'll go button opens big  
blind calls and I'll just select the Flop reports 
now flop reports are great because you can see  
what the overall strategy looks like but you can 
also see what players expected value looks like  
for example here we see big blind's expected value 
buttons expected value and we can toggle that  
between EV and big blinds and as a percentage of 
the pot using either hotkeys or by changing your  
settings now let's go over here and take a look 
at the betting note so this shows how often the  
button should be c-bedding across all possible 
flops and in general we're going to notice that  
at NL 500 we're going to be betting a bit wider 
than for example at nl50 and conversely you  
notice that at nl50 the big plane donks more 
often than an nl500 so what's going on here  
well again this is just um a buy factor of the 
fact that big blinds range is tighter at nl50  
right they call fewer hands at nl50 their ranges 
therefore stronger when they do call and therefore  
we see bet less often as the button at an l50 
inversely at nl500 the range is wider and so we  
get to see that a little bit more often and we'll 
notice that you know even facing a bet for example  
the overall raising and calling frequencies are 
very similar and this is because the solver will  
adapt how wide and what type of hands it bets to 
the rake structure to achieve a new equilibrium  
and notice for example across all possible flops 
we're folding a third of the time versus a third  
pot bet at nl50 and the third at a time facing 
a third pot that at NL 500 really doesn't change  
too much the only thing that maybe changes a bit 
is the three betting frequency and even then uh  
it's it's very close I did a similar analysis for 
under the gun versus big blind single race pot and  
we see all the same things the big blinds EV is 
stable across all three so in all cases they're  
getting about 29 of the pot The Rake tends to eat 
into the under the gun players EV post flop and  
this is a function of big blinds range getting 
tighter as you increase the rake analyzing the  
reports in GTL wizard we don't see very much 
of a difference between the aggregate betting  
strategies at NL 500 compared to nl50 you'll 
notice that it's very very similar putting in  
more money at NL 500 as the end of the gun player 
because you're playing against a wider calling  
Rich they're the same as before we're going to 
open up GTR Wizard and here we're looking at  
cut off opens small blind three bets action back 
on cut off this is 500 NL we can see that they're  
calling a good quarter of the time or betting 
maybe 10 of the time overall defending a pretty  
decent portion of their range at nl50 however 
uh even with the same size you're folding a lot  
more often uh defending less often and overall 
against this size you should basically be four  
betting more often than you're calling and 
so this means that when cutoff does call they  
have a much stronger range in general which is 
why we saw the patterns observed earlier chart  
let's take a look at the Flop reports so I'll open 
this up and take a look at the flops here we see  
that at nl50 we're checking about 37 percent of 
the time and typically preferring a good mix of  
sizes anywhere from 20 to 75. at NL 500 you 
can see very similar overall distribution in  
our frequencies but certainly Majors change the 
biggest change is in our expected value in terms  
of total pot share see that up here as well so 
anyway the main takeaway here is to be cognizant  
of when you hit your raid cap as a reminder 
you can calculate when you hit the right cup  
by taking the cap in this case it's four big lines 
and dividing it by the percentage or divided by  
five percent is 80 big blind so at nl50 you only 
hit the rake once the Pod exceeds 80 big blinds  
but for example at NL 500 you'll hit the rake much 
sooner so here it's 0.6 that's the gap divided by  
the five percent rake so you hit the rate cap once 
the pot exceeds 12 big lines and so it's important  
to pay attention to that specific threshold 
because that's going to tell you a lot about how a  
solver wants to maneuver its pre-flop strategy all 
right I think we'll wrap it up here if you guys  
have any questions about anything feel free to 
reach out in our Discord server it's a great place  
to ask Theory questions or just drop a comment on 
this YouTube video I hope you guys enjoyed I hope  
you got something useful out of it and I hope you 
pay less rake and as always happy grinding foreign
