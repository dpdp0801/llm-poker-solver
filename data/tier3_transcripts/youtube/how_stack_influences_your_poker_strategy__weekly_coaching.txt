### TOPIC: how stack influences your poker strategy
today's lecture is about stack depth theory 
and how stackdepth affects your strategy now  
stackdepth is a key metric to poker strategy it 
influences how you evaluate hands it influences  
the polarity of your betting ranges optimal 
bet sizing and the truth is that most players  
myself included i don't really know how to adapt 
correctly to different sprs and when i'm talking  
about stack depth i'm not necessarily talking 
about how much you buy in and i'm not talking  
about how much money is on the table per se what 
matters strategically is the stack-to-pot ratio  
right how much money you have behind relative 
to the size of the pot so the stack-to-pot ratio  
essentially influences everything about the 
evaluation of different hand classes and what  
types of strategies you should take i'm going 
to start with some fundamental definitions here  
just so that everyone watching has an idea of what 
i'm going to be talking about later on so spr the  
stacked pot ratio again that's the money behind 
relative to the size of the pot nut potential is  
the strength of your hand when your draw completes 
now as we get deeper stacked the value of  
the nut potential of a hand increases that is to 
say the value of hitting the nut flush becomes  
exponentially higher deep stacked than short 
stacked and that should be obvious because there's  
more money that gets to go in later and therefore 
that draw will have higher implied odds implied  
odds of course are the value you expect to gain 
on future streets should you outdraw your opponent  
and in contrast we can talk about raw equity that 
is to say the strength of your hand if all players  
were to simply check down it's important to 
understand these fundamentals because these  
are the main things that change uh strategically 
as the spr changes as the stack depth changes  
so how does stackdepth influence your strategy 
well raw equity tends to become more important  
at low sprs whereas it becomes less important at 
high sprs that is to say just having any made hand  
at a low enough spr is sometimes good enough to 
just get chips in but at deeper stacks it starts  
to become problematic to have say top pair no 
kicker and end up paying off top pair better  
kicker as an example stack off ranges so stack 
off ranges are essentially how wide or tight you  
can stack off over one or multiple bet sizes and 
this is a function of the spr at shorter stacks  
there's less money behind and therefore after 
all the money goes in you're going to call wider  
compared to deeper stacks where the bet sizes have 
to be larger and larger or they'll have to be more  
and more bets in order to get all the money in 
and this is a concept i've talked about before  
but essentially you stack off wider at low sprs 
and you stack off tighter at high sprs and yes  
this webinar is relevant to all formats generally 
what i cover is gonna be something that you can  
carry over to spins mtt's heads up sit and goes 
cache i try and keep the theory relevant to most  
formats although personally i do specialize more 
in cash but for the purpose of this lecture you  
can apply it everywhere so we've talked about nut 
potential that's how valuable your hand is should  
you make your draw and nut potential becomes less 
valuable at short stacks because even if you do  
make your draw there's only so much money that can 
go in afterwards whereas it becomes more valuable  
deeper stacked because of course your implied 
odds are higher now implied odds are one of  
the things that changes the most of course it's 
shorter stacks low implied odds you'll have lower  
implied odds because there's less money behind 
and also lower reverse implied odds so getting  
in with top hair it's very difficult to fold top 
hair at low sprs but deeper as i said top pair  
no kicker can become more of a problem and so 
there's higher implied odds for your draws but  
also higher reverse implied odds for example if 
you hit your draw and they have a better draw or  
if you hit a strong hand and they have a better 
strong hand so that's why nut potential becomes a  
larger part of your decision deeper stack and less 
important shorter stacked lastly the positional  
advantage tends to increase as stacks get deeper 
and decrease as stacks get shorter tends to  
increase with the log of the pot that is to say 
as you get deeper deeper the effect the advantage  
it grants to the in-position player tends to get 
smaller and smaller so let's look at positional  
advantage a little bit this graph was taken from 
a heads-up experiment i ran maybe a year ago  
essentially it's just heads up cash no rake and 
the effective stack anywhere between 50 and 300  
big lines and we can see that the in positions 
player their ev increases as we increase the  
stack depth so we can say the positional advantage 
is magnified as stacks get deeper and in general  
late position is going to be able to open wider 
stacks get deeper as more hands become profitable  
to play in position next i just want to touch 
on the concept of pot geometry so part geometry  
just a fancy word for the geometric bet size so 
betting the same percentage on each street to get  
stacks in by the river this lecture won't really 
talk too much about the geometric bet size but  
it's important to understand that as you get 
deeper in order to get all the money in over three  
streets for example you'll need to bet larger and 
so we can use this metric to kind of determine  
for example approximate stack-off ranges or how 
much equity you'll need to stack off with right  
now essentially if you give one player a perfectly 
polarized range a geometric betting strategy is  
going to maximize how much money villain puts 
into the pot while also getting all the money  
in by the river in practice it's a little more 
complicated there are non-geometric strategies  
you know bet small and flop over that 
turn jam river but regardless we can use  
this to kind of determine roughly how wide people 
need to defend at different stock depths and so  
this chart was actually taken from another one of 
my lectures so for example a 200 big blind single  
raised pots the spr is quite high that is to say 
there's a lot of money behind relative to the pot  
and so if you approximate the stack off range over 
for example one to three bets just based on mdf  
they're going to have to stack off very tight 
because the amount of betting that has to happen  
and the size of the bats are so big that the final 
call down range is extremely tight and therefore  
only the most nutted hands can really get all the 
money in for value right if your opponent is only  
defending something like five percent of their 
range by the river five percent of the range they  
started with on the fl on the flop per se and by 
the river you're going to need a very very strong  
set of hands in order to extract value from that 
so this is why nut potential increases as stacks  
get deeper now for example if we look at a low 
sbr situation so we can look at for example a  
four bed part here the stack to pot ratio is 
much lower right 1.7 1.3 there's maybe two  
bets behind three bets if you bet small and in 
these cases the stack off ranges are much wider  
simply because there's less money behind and so 
this is what a lot of coaches will say that's  
people tend to drastically under defend for 
example in position in like a three bed pot  
or four bed pot for example simply because how 
wide you have to defend is always a function  
of the spr and at these really low sprs you really 
do have to defend quite a wide part of your range  
now again this is just based on some toy game math 
it's not going to be like this for every single  
spot right adam harris asks but the starting 
range is very tight for bed pot yeah and so is  
the defending range right depending on what you're 
looking at so as a function of the ranges that  
go post flop when the spr is quite low you still 
have to do to defend quite wide like you couldn't  
get away with defending five percent of your range 
with an spr of one for example that it's not going  
to make any sense right you'll just be drastically 
overfolding villain could just for example shove  
everything and you'd end up folding most of your 
range so always important to keep in mind stack  
to pot ratio and how that correlates with how wide 
you need to defend again this doesn't have to be  
cash you can look at this in heads up mtt you can 
look at this in spins everything right it's always  
about stack and pot the spr so something else i'd 
like to chat about is the efficient jam principle  
now this is kind of a term i made up but i don't 
really know how else this would be described so  
it needed some sort of terminology essentially 
shoving is a pretty serious weapon in holdem and  
the reason is that hands that shove always realize 
their equity and the person that shoves first  
gets the last laugh so solvers will often choose 
sizes that attempt to avoid giving their opponents  
a good price on the shove or alternatively 
setting themselves up for a good price on  
a shove the essential idea is that for example 
at shorter stacks what will typically happen is  
it's going to min open and if it three bets it's 
either going to three bet to a very small size  
or it's going to jam and if jamming isn't really 
something it can do with a good part of its value  
range it might split so i'm going to show you 
some examples of the efficient jam principle in  
action across different formats and this applies 
pre and post flop so we'll go take a look at some  
examples preflop strategies three betting 
polarity post flop comparisons and so on so  
let's go take a look at a few different 
spots so let's start with for example
a 50 big blind cash spot we'll go button opens 
action on big blind and big blind raises 10.
now in this spot you can see it doesn't even have 
the option for a smaller bet it simply jams right  
of course you could raise the 20 but the problem 
is that it's very close to pot committing in  
fact let me go to 75 i think it's going to be 
a better example of what i'm talking about here  
yeah so 75 big blind steep button opens big blind 
three bets action on button now something you'll  
notice is that at low sprs these premium hands 
tend to uh trap a lot more and this is common  
to mtt's as well but essentially it's jamming with 
the more vulnerable part of its for betting range  
for example tens jax ace queen ace king these 
hands tend to do better getting the money in  
immediately whereas the more valuable premium 
hands for example queens kings aces ace king  
suited a screen suited these hands are going for 
a min raise it wouldn't make a lot of sense to  
for example raised to 30 big blinds here because 
if you do that you're putting in too much money  
and you have to over defend your range versus 
a shove so instead it wants to use a very small  
raise and so the people who ran the self gave it 
either a shove or a very small format such that  
we're trying to not give villain a fantastic price 
on a shove and we don't have to uh over defend our  
range if you were to use 30 big lines what will 
end up happening for example is the button has to  
use a lot more pocket pairs it has to call a lot 
wider versus a shove simply because the amount of  
money you've already committed is more and the 
size of their their five bet shove is smaller  
relative to the pot and so in order to make the 
correct bluff value ratios what ends up happening  
is a min raise becomes most effective now 
let's look at the same spot a little bit deeper  
we'll go to 100 big lines so button opens actually 
not big blind this time they have three bit larger  
you can see it's 27 this time and again the more 
vulnerable hands are going to be shoving whereas  
the rest of these are going to 27. and here we'll 
continue this up let's go up to 200 big lines now  
button opens the preferred three bet size actually 
gets just a little bit smaller out of position  
and now we can see that the four bet size 
has gone up to 38 big blinds 38 right a  
lot of people if they haven't studied deep stack 
they're going to be a little bit flabbergasted by  
this massive four bet right but if 
you think about it the reason you use  
if you're used to for example 
100 big blinds as a cash player  
the reason that you use like something like a 
25 big blind four bet is simply because you're  
constrained by the stack depth right it's only 
100 big blinds behind whereas at 200 big blinds  
you have a lot more room to play a more polarizing 
more natural for example pot-sized raise
without over committing relative to the 
stock depth does this still apply if  
your opponent is short stacked good question 
jackson so what we're always concerned about  
is what we call the effective stack depth so if 
you were a thousand big blinds and your head's up  
in a pot with an opponent that has 10 big blinds 
you are playing 10 big blinds effective right  
so war is looking at the amount of money that 
can be risked and then comparing that to the  
size of the pot so let's go take a look at this 
one here something else again that is related to  
efficient jam principle is that in both 
cache and mtt and spins is that you tend  
to open smaller when the effective stack 
is lower so for example if cutoff opens
there's a very good chance that their opponent 
will shove if they face a continue and so the most  
efficient strategy if you expect your opponents 
to shove a lot is to open for the smallest size  
possible which is a min open in this case right 
the other big thing that changes is that at  
shorter stack dips this is 20 big blinds effective 
by the way the opening range of hands tends to  
shift towards more high card equity so this is a 
cut off spot and as we can see we're opening a7  
off we're opening lots of high card equity and 
as we go through it for example this is 40 big  
blinds effective we're going to see that it starts 
to shift to more hands that do better at deeper  
stacks so for example more pocket pairs suited 
connectors fewer of these dominated asex hands  
75 big lines 100 big blinds 150 big lines 200 big 
blinds raphael says blockers of the shoving range  
yeah that's very important as well trying to 
block that shoving range is important boy asks  
if positions are reverse do we still keep the 
small four bet generally the size of the four  
bets is going to be relative to the size of the 
pots even if you're out of position but it does  
come down somewhat to the polarity so i'm going 
to run through this one more time here there's 20  
big blinds now pay attention to how the shape the 
range changes as we get deeper 40 50 75 100 150  
200 and we can see we need more robust equity 
as raphael says we need hands that for example  
these hands are going to do better in a deeper 
stacked pod because these hands rely on making  
big draws in order to justify opening them right 
they get most of their money from imply dots  
whereas for example a seven off suit here this 
hand mostly is gonna make its money from just  
making top pair right you're not making any big 
draws with a seven off suit and so as you get  
deeper you wanna shift your range construction 
towards different types of hands and something  
else to note is that the cutoff gets to open wider 
as we go deeper for example we went from 26 to  
30 i think and that's largely just because 
more hands are profitable to play in position  
joe asks why is polarity more important 
deeper stacked is it because you can stack off  
wider shorter stacked yeah exactly we'll get to 
that shortly actually so let's take a look at  
this spot next again cash game now we're looking 
at post flop and here we've got queen jack five  
and i've compared these spots button 
versus big lined from 20 to 200 blind steep  
and something i've got this here open in the  
equity distribution graph now one thing to note 
is that the ranges do change so as we get deeper  
the equity distribution graph tends to 
get tighter and tighter simply because the  
ranges have changed but something else 
that happens is that as we get deeper we  
can start using over bets and start using a more 
polarized strategy now here at 20 big lines deep  
it's not going to make a whole lot of sense to 
start over betting right the spr is only four  
so typically in mtts in short stack cash 
in three bed pots anywhere where the spr  
is relatively low you usually stretch it out over 
three streets and in order to do that you need to  
start with a smaller size right here for example 
it's just betting the minimum as the most common
now as we start to get deeper and deeper
example this is 75
100 big lines you can start to use a more 
polarizing over bet size on a flop like this right
raphael asks we always focus on our nuttered 
hands they will want to stack off right  
right and so in a situation like this you're 
going to have enough nutted hands on for  
example queen jack 5 that the button wants 
to get all the money in by the river now  
if you're 20 big lines deep or if the spr is for 
example four like we saw in the first one there  
you don't need a big size to get all the money in 
by the river you can bet the minimum on the flop  
make a medium bets on turn medium battle 
river and you're going to get stacks in right  
whereas when the spr gets deeper well a min bet 
is going to be a little bit harder to get it in so  
i've talked about the mechanics of seabed sizing 
in another one of my videos i won't get too much  
into it here but essentially as you get deeper 
there becomes more opportunity for large overbet  
sizes large check raises and more aggressive 
strategies the larger the sizes that are used  
the more polarized you can play and of course you 
can also put high equity draws in here as well  
all right so this one is ace seven six 
monotone something else that changes is that  
we've talked about how the in position 
player generally is going to have more of  
an advantage and what this means is that the out 
of position player needs to trap more they need to  
put more effort into defending their range so they 
can't play as aggressively unless of course they  
can shove so for example this one is button 
versus big blind a76 monotone button has bet  
third part action is on us so here we're 20 big 
blinds effective and it's raising 11.3 percent  
but as we get deeper it's going to raise less 
and less so here's 40 big lines it's raising 8  
50 big blinds 7.6 75 big months it's raising 7.1 
100 big lines 150 200 big blinds and so we see  
this interesting pattern where big blind can check 
raise less frequently as we get deeper and deeper  
because essentially their calling range needs 
to be able to defend against more pressure right  
their calling range can essentially 200 big lines 
deep can just face massive over bets over and over  
and over again and so because it needs to defend 
against more pressure you can't raise as much  
and similarly your check raising range is also 
problematic because playing a check raise deep  
stacked out of position is going to be tricky on a 
very dynamic board like this all right so this one  
is heads up very simple we're just looking at 
how big blind's three bet changes in response  
to our opening size so here we're 20 big lines 
deep right and we can see the 20 big lines deep  
they can only open something like 72 percent 
of hats and big blind mainly three bets using  
a shoving range right however the nutted portion 
of their three bed range or at least the value  
portion for example aces kings queens jacks tens 
ace king these hands are raising smaller whereas  
a lot of the rest of it for example 
these lower pocket pairs and asex hands  
they're simply shoving they're trying to get the 
money in now immediately because these hands have  
these are what we'll call for example high raw 
equity hands but hands with poor implied odds so  
these hands if they do three bet would prefer 
to simply shove now of course it does need to  
balance it with different types of hands here as 
well for example a6 suited as shoving and that's  
because these types of hands actually retain 
their equity reasonably well against the range  
of hands that call joe asks should you lean 
towards stacking off with high equity draws  
when you were short stacked in an mtt or would you 
rather check back in position to try and realize  
equity 50 to 20 big blinds yeah that's a great 
question joe so typically you're going to want to  
check high equity draws if your opponent can 
shove and then push you off that draw we see this  
a lot in for example cash game for bed parts 
or mtt situations where you're in that 20 to 30  
min stack range and someone has bet recently large 
on the flop you don't want the worst possible  
situation is you bet for example a flush draw 
or a straight jaw or a combo draw your opponent  
shoves just over pot and now you don't have pot 
odds to call right that's the absolute worst  
situation or alternatively you do have products 
to call but your eevee is just terrible you're  
indifferent that's a bad situation so oftentimes 
what solvers will do is they will check back  
high equity draws in situations like that where 
the opponent can potentially shove for reasonable  
size and push them off their equity and so that's 
why i say those types of draws often can be  
thought of as showdown value hands when the 
spr is low yeah justin says happens a lot in  
three bet pots on the turn after flop bet yeah 
exactly like that's a good cash game example uh  
three bit pot on the turn you'll often end up 
checking back high equity draws simply because the  
value of retaining your implied outs is going to 
be better than betting immediately and potentially  
getting shoved on so those high equity draws can 
play more as a medium strike hand in that sense  
so here we can see for example 40 pick lines deep 
you're gonna get the three bets are going to be  
leaning towards more offsuit stuff and a lot of 
pocket pairs we can see that the more vulnerable  
pocket pairs for example twos threes fours 
fives these have reasonable equity as a shove  
believe it or not just because in position 
has to call with enough worse hands right
and so what ends up happening is the most 
vulnerable types of high equity hands  
tend to shove if they can if 
they're getting a reasonable price  
whereas the more valuable hands again will 
tend to bet smaller and as we increase the  
stack depth the three betting range leans 
less towards these offsuit blockerish type  
hands and it's going to lean more towards hands 
with better playability and we're going to get  
something that is going to become a little more 
familiar so here's 60 80 100 big lines 150 and oh  
200 and as we can see like 200 big lines obviously 
you can't just go and shove pocket twos right  
so what ends up happening is you lean more towards 
nutted hands and hands that can make high value  
draws for example these suited connectors suited 
gappers for example and proportionally you're  
going to get less of these off suit hands in 
range although they are still there at a frequency  
less hands dominates as well yeah that's 
right so let's talk a little bit about  
limping premiums all right so here we've 
got mtt spot it is 10 big blinds effective  
and it has folded to small blind 
now a lot of people when they reach  
for example 10 big blinds and an mtt they're just 
going to shove or fold and i'm not saying that's  
not a fine strategy of course we have no limb 
solutions as well as well as lymph solutions  
and so when it follows the small blind we can 
see that for example even though it's not allowed  
to limp it's still attempting to do something 
near the same strategy that is to say it wants  
to limp a polarized range containing some nutted 
hands some reasonable equity hands and some trash
and if it is allowed to limp
small blind again their limping range 
is somewhat polarized towards these  
very high value hands and very low value hands
right maybe that's easier to picture like this  
the limping range contains hiv hands and 
low ev hands whereas the opening range
the shoving range is more condensed and sometimes 
that can be a little confusing like why would  
you polarize your slow plays and then depolarized 
your fast plays and again this this just has to do  
with realizing your equity and so for example ace 
2 is going to do much better if it can realize  
all of its equity immediately as opposed to you 
know trying to draw and again if you limp here  
what ends up happening is because you're 
depolarized if you face a shove you've got  
a very easy fold with the bottom of your range 
and a very easy call with the top of your range  
now some people are like okay well limp 
calling queen 7 suited seems insane but  
again guys this is like blind versus 
blind so ranges are ultra wide right
and this effect of limping premium hands 
it extends further than just this one wacky  
spot so for example here's button limping jacks 
through aces here's low jack doing the same thing  
and as you can see the limping range is still 
quite polarized so let's take a look at maybe  
a deeper stacked spot we could go 
to 30 big blinds here for example  
and here it's going to stop 
limping at least in early position
so why do we think this is alex asks 
seems like silver prefers three betting  
hands pre-flop with more nutted qualities 
deep to have more polarization post flop  
yeah spot on alex very well said said it better 
than me and so i think it's important that  
when you're deeper you should be able to polarize 
better so you want to be able to flop more nutted  
hands more knotted draws nutted qualities as you 
say in order to play a more polarized strategy  
deep stack you don't want to be for example deep 
stacked with a whole bunch of top hair no kicker  
type of hands that just struggle to improve 
deep stacked you want hands that can improve  
more effectively well medium strength hands will 
often under realize their equity not it draws and  
hands with nut potential will over realize their 
equity deep stacked and so here's maybe another  
example here we have button open big blind has 
three bet and again they three bet relatively  
small because it's only 30 big lines effective so 
they make it from two to eight if this were deeper  
you would see the big blind three bet much larger 
but they don't want to give button a great price  
on a shove so the hands that do three bets uh to 
a small size go here so they three bet to 8.2 and  
as we can see a lot of these premium 
nutted hands queens kings aces  
they're just calling right they're not shoving and 
this could feel very strange especially to cash  
game players like why on earth are you calling 
with pocket queens here but the truth is that  
you're calling range you could put more 
traps in there when you're shorter stacked  
whereas if we were much deeper it's 
going to trap significantly less often
and maybe this is a bad example
now we can see the premium hands 
are three betting more often  
and if you change this over to for example 
cash where there's rake considered as well
again there's a little bit of trapping with 
ace and less here raphael says a lot of poker  
is about realizing and pushing equity very well 
said very well said so what do i have here oh  
yeah the deep stack triple barrel this one's kind 
of a fun one deep stacked triple barrel math so
actually i should mention 
this beforehand the entire  
june daily doses are all about uh stack 
depth and how strategy changes and so  
all of these quizzes they start with really 
short stocks and the month progressively  
progressively gets deeper and deeper so if 
you're looking to learn a little bit more after  
this maybe go try out some of these quizzes some 
are better than others and you can test yourself  
a few different things so here's the one i made 
for deep stack triple barrel math so this is  
a 200 big blind cash game uh big blind versus 
button three bad pots big blind triple barrels  
on flop turn river under the gun calls down 
the board runs out ace king deuce seven eight  
if under the gun starts with four and a half 
percent flushes on the flop never raises what  
percentage of their final call down range will be 
a flush by the river and the reason i like this  
question is simply because it's very mathematical 
i can just calculate it and a lot of poker  
is quite intuitive and not so well defined but 
this question is so i've got the spot open here  
i guess i might have given away the answer there 
but go ahead and take a guess again it's big blind  
versus under the gun three bet pot and triple 
barrel shove on this monotone flop what percentage  
of under the gun's final calling 
range will be a flush by the river  
take a guess in the chat vicky says 35 rafael's 
guessing 10. someone else got a guess in there  
50 50 yeah this one's uh kind of 
funky so the way you'd solve this  
the answer is 25 the way you can solve this one 
is just by simply using mdf so firstly in position  
isn't really going to be raising a whole lot at 
any point throughout this tree so they retain  
all of their flushes from flop to showdown they 
started with 4.5 and so the way to calculate this  
is just to calculate the minimum defense frequency 
on each street multiply those out so about 18  
of their starting range and so under the 
gun's final starting rate is only 18 percent  
under the gun's final range is only 18 of their 
starting range sorry and so you end up with 25  
flushes something else to take note is that the 
ace and the king remove most of the flushes from  
the range so let me take a look here so here 
actually it's 4.3 flushes but close enough  
and something else to keep in mind about 
uh three bed parts is that oftentimes  
especially when the three bet 
was large you're going to have  
fewer flushes or flush draws in range 
because you're going to have proportionally  
more pocket pairs relative to the amount of suited 
hands in range right and so despite it being  
monotone there's not that many flushes in range 
to start with so big blind seabets two-thirds part
they see bet again two-thirds part
and they see that again on the river full pot
they call and we can see the amount of 
flushes goes to 25 and this speaks to  
stack off ranges as you get deeper and 
deeper something that you started with  
at 4.5 percent of your range can quickly 
balloon up to you know 25 of your range  
and this is a spot like yeah we're 200 
big lines deep but the spr isn't that big  
you know it's just two-thirds two-thirds pot 
imagine what happens when it's over bet over  
bet over bet check raise shove right it's even 
tighter and very small a very small portion of  
your nutted hands becomes just a huge portion 
of the final calling range simply because  
the amount of hands that need to defend against 
larger and larger sizes and more and more bets  
becomes less and less that's why nun advantage 
becomes more important at deeper stack depths  
because as a function of the hands that stack off 
they become a larger and larger portion of the  
range because it gets tighter and tighter right 
you can start with for example two percent sets  
and then if you're only calling three percent of 
your range by the time all the money has gone in  
that is to say three percent of your initial flop 
range well all of a sudden you're two thirds sets  
by the time you stack off right so always keep in 
mind that the nut advantage is going to dictate  
sizing polarity and the implied odds of your 
nut enhance is going to increase drastically  
as the stacks get deeper in conclusion stock depth 
is a fundamental metric that drives your strategic  
incentives the spr influences how much money you 
can put in which affects the value of implied odds  
stack off range's nut potential and the polarity 
of your betting ranges in general you're going  
to end up trapping more when stacks are shorter 
because it's very easy to get money in later uh  
if you watched wacko's coaching his previous one 
you'll have seen that for example in three bed  
parts in position tends to slow play sets more oft 
simply because it's very easy to get the money in  
later it's not a whole lot of incentive to shove 
now whereas the deeper stacks those nutted hands  
need to build the pot similarly in short stack 
mtt scenarios a lot of the nutted hens will simply  
call a raise or they'll limp in for example and 
so another function of this is that your incentive  
to build the pot with nutted hands changes as 
stacks are short or deep and the types of ranges  
you build the polarity of those ranges change as 
stacks get shorter and deeper now a lot of people  
they'll just think about for example this hand has 
many possible draws but they won't think about the  
nut potential of those draws for example if you 
have a combo draw that's either going to complete  
bottom straight or a baby flush that is not a 
very like that hand has maybe has a lot of outs  
to draw to a reasonable hand but it's not super 
nutted because if you get a flush it's a baby  
flush and if you get a straight it's the bottom 
straight and so there's a difference between how  
many outs your hand has to complete a draw and 
the nut potential of that hand similarly as you  
get deep stacked the things like set over set for 
example become much more problematic people they  
don't normally account for how much tighter the 
final stackoff range gets as the spr gets bigger  
and bigger so the other main thing to keep in 
mind is that regardless if you're pre or post  
what ends up happening is the solver is often 
going to use sizes that will try and allow it  
to get stacked in by the river if it has enough 
of a nut advantage and at short stacks that's  
not really that's not really an issue if you're on 
the flop you can often use just a minimum bet size  
in a low spr situation and then you know like a 
half pot bet turn in river or if your pre-flop  
and the spr is low enough you can even just three 
bet shove for example anyway i think i'll wrap it  
up here guys thank you all for coming call it a 
day here and happy grinding thanks all so much
