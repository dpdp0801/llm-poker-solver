### TOPIC: how to analyze your poker hands
hey guys i'm money j2k with gto wizard
and today
i'll be going over one of my own hands
from 500 no
this hand taught me an important
principle regarding blockers and triple
barrel situations so let's get into it
so as always i'll replay the hand and
then analyze the strategy afterwards
this hand starts off with the small
blind opening to 15 dollars
and i'm on the big blind with ace four
spades this hand will mix between
calling and three betting and this time
i choose to put in the three bet
small blind calls flop comes king five
two
two tone in the hand i was thinking that
this board we would be betting at a very
high frequency
somewhere around 80 percent or so and
that my hand would probably be
betting at a pretty high frequency
itself as well with the gut shot
i bet small he calls
turns to jack of clubs in the hand i was
thinking that spades
were a good combo to barrel here because
when the diamond draws and the club
draws miss
i will still have some really good
barrel offs here that
that aren't blocking any of his misdraws
as well as this specific hand i was
thinking in the in the hand that
the gut shot will give me that little
bit of extra equity that will
push it into more into more of the
bluffing kind of hands and
less of the check back the ace highs um
and so in the hand i bet
about roughly two-thirds a little bit
more than that 75 a pot
he calls river is the two of clubs
he checks and so here i'm mainly
thinking that a lot of his club draws
were either raising the flop folding pre
or blocked by the king and the jack on
the board
now obviously i would prefer to have the
ace of clubs here
but i don't think we're only going to be
barreling off the ace of clubs here i
think in general this is a really good
board for us and we're gonna have a lot
of two pairs we're gonna have a lot
we're gonna have both all the sets i
think
and we're going to have some 2x as well
on the river
and so i put in the bluff jam i get snap
called
by king queen and so
this specific hand i wasn't quite sure
on
what my bluff combos were on the river i
don't think i knew in the hand that i
wouldn't want just to bluff
club blockers there's going to be other
spades and there's going to be some
just random hands in there that are just
just have no showdown value
and beat nothing and therefore
our make up for some really good bluffs
i was thinking we'd be betting this
river at a
reasonable frequency like 60 maybe
but i didn't love after the hand that
my hand selection in general i thought i
might have been getting a little bit out
of line and over bluffing so i went
ahead and double checked it
so now that we're in gta wizard we can
start analyzing
where some of my mistakes were made and
maybe my misconceptions in the hand
and so my first misconception in the
hand was
i overestimated the
range advantage that i had i was
thinking king high boards are really
good for us
and while i think that is true as in
general sense the five and the two on
the board gives him
a lot of two pairs and some sets that i
won't have
and then he also because this is
specifically blind versus blind
he still has a lot of these king 4 king
5
king 6 king 7 combos that
in almost any other 3 bet spot he
wouldn't have
and in all honesty i haven't really
studied small blind versus big blind
three bet pots nearly enough
and realizing this little extra king x
that he has as well as these king 10 off
combos and king jack off combos
really pushes the equity much closer
together
and that's proven here by 50 to 50
equity so
really neither player has a equity
advantage here
now we have slightly more of the top end
hands and
slightly more of the good hands and then
he has some of these weaker hands a
little bit more often and then we have
more trash hands
but in general if we just look at the
equity graph we can really see
it's pretty even throughout the entire
graph it's everything is is pretty equal
and i would not have thought this i
would have thought we had a slight
advantage
across most of the range and this a lot
like i said has to do with him having
fives him having fight or him having
twos
him having king five and just him having
more king x than i was thinking in the
hand so it's
really important to be able to correctly
visualize the ranges that were going
into the flop here
and that is where some of my original
misconceptions were had
and so when we hop over to the strategy
we can see he's got a small donking
range here
and that just goes right back to the
amount of equity he has and that we're
checking back
um we're going to be checking back
roughly 50 of the time 40
of the time and we so so he
has somewhat of an incentive to donk but
it's going to be pretty rare
and i don't think population in at 500
is going to be donking this
board probably ever and so he checks
and as we hop into our c betting
strategy
we can see it's pretty mixed all across
the board we're betting overall 60
of the time in the hand i probably would
have guessed 70 to 80
which may not be a very big difference
overall
but i definitely misunderstood how often
i'd be betting ace4
i would have thought that it was
probably betting almost pure or
at least seventy percent eighty percent
of the time
and that's just a simple i have a gut
shot
solvers really like gut shots i'm just
gonna bet
and sometimes when you're in the hand
you don't really get a lot of the time
to calculate exactly the ranges and
everything like that
and you make some split decisions that
may not always be correct
and while this is a small discrepancy
you know the ev difference is going to
be extremely small
but it's an important thing to make sure
that your overall frequencies in your
head are
moving in the right direction and not
the wrong direction obviously
and so either way my sizing was pretty
much correct
using a really small size for at a
relatively
high frequency around 60 bet
so we go ahead and put in the small size
and now he's definitely has this pretty
robust raising range here and that just
goes back to the equities being very
close on this board
and a lot of his raises come from these
flush draws if we go filter
by the flush draws we can see that a lot
of these hands
are mixed raises at pretty high
frequencies as well especially the
asexual
low low nut flush draws and the highest
king king x also are raising a lot
and so it's a good question in the hand
how often he will actually be raising
and will he be raising enough king x as
well
and which would if he wasn't raising
enough we would probably just
bet more and more as the imposition
player is the big blind
and that is an important exploit that we
can use now
in the hand i am playing anonymous
tables because i'm playing on ignition i
don't really have a read on this player
so
we're going to be trying to play as
close to gto as possible
and it's just important to note that he
needs to be finding some raises that
may not always be super intuitive hands
like five four
you know maybe seven six mo some people
won't do eight six maybe people won't be
using especially
you know eight six of clubs and whatnot
and
like uh the a lot of these just like
backdoor flush draws and nut flush draws
and
are just raising at frequencies and it's
going to be important
as the small blind to actually raise a
lot of these hands as you can see almost
every hand has
some frequency of mixed raises but
anyways
he calls and we see a turn turn was jack
o'clock
and on the turn he checks range the turn
is going to be pretty good for us i
believe
and we can see as the as while the
equities come very close
this is less important on the turn and
this is much more important where we
have this really large nut advantage now
we have almost double the the or a
little bit over
double the best hands and as you go
farther and farther in the in
into the hand the top end advantage
becomes more and more important
because a lot of the lowest in hands are
simply just going to fold to bets
and they're not going to be able to
realize their equity anyways so that
amount of equity
is important but it doesn't it isn't
always the defining
part of your strategy a lot of these
top-end hands that we have are going to
be much more important
and so when we hop over to the
strategies
we can see that we're again betting
roughly 60
of the time betting pure with all of our
best hands here
especially these highest king x betting
a mix between 60
and this over bet size which in the hand
i don't think i would have been using
the over bet size i think i would have
probably simplified here to about
the size that i use that was around 75
percent
and in the hand i think i was playing
the turn in the overall frequencies
pretty close
we can see a lot of the checks come from
these pocket pairs that are
is fairly intuitive a lot of come from
these jack x hands
these lowest jack x and then a lot of
checks are just coming from like lower
end king x as well
in some of these like 5x hands like the
the nut 5x hands like ace five
and so the issue that i had in the hand
was that ace four of spades basically
never uses this uh 60 size and a very
low frequency uses this over bet size
but it's basically pure checking and
i thought about this a lot and trying to
understand why ace forest
is checking and hands like queen forest
spades
are pure betting hands like if we just
go to the filters and filter for spade
combos
we can see all of these low in spade
combos here
are betting really high frequencies even
though they're
just worse than ace four this
is basically my my best guess is that
the ace of spades has a lot of very
negative blockers so when we put in the
60
size and we go back to the same filter
the spades filter
we can see that the ace of spade the ace
of spade blocks
a lot of these nut um these these
highest spade draws basically that they
were
draws to these gut shots that we're
calling the flop but they're not going
to be calling
the turn bets and so this ace the ace of
spades is just blocking all of these
and this is fairly significant this is a
lot of combos you can see the ace 10 as
well the ace 9 as well
the this is blocking a lot of the
folding range and so that basically just
means when we have the ace of spades we
get called mark because we're blocking
his folding range
and the ace of spades isn't really
blocking a lot of his calling range
it's only blocking the ace jack off
combos
and the ace jack um h jack spades combos
and the ace queen off combos but this is
this is less i think of a factor overall
than all of this folding range being
blocked and then as we go back down we
can also just see that
the equity difference for these hands
this um this ace 4 of spades that's 21
equity which is pretty small it's very
low but when we go down here and we look
at like queen forest phase that was
betting a very high frequency it's only
9
equity and we basically what this is
telling us is that we just have a lot of
bad hands
and we have a lot of hands that have a
high incentive to bluff
because when you when your hand only has
nine percent equity it
anything that folds to it is extremely
good for that hand
and so we are going to have a high
incentive to bet these lower end
um spade hands and the ace iv
is going to have a little bit higher
incentive to check instead of the queen
force
the the queen fours the queen threes and
you know the ten threes and
we can see the spade and the heart
combos are very similar in strategies as
well
and so this is a pretty important
um misconception i think i had in the
hand and this is where
i lose i definitely lose a small amount
of ev here
the issue with this
with this hand is that i'm probably it's
not just ace four
i'm probably betting you know i'm
probably betting too much maybe with
with 108 of spades i'm doing it too much
or i'm just
choosing some hands that maybe i'm
probably just over bluffing in general
which is going to be pretty bad for my
overall range where
maybe this let's see what the ev
difference was
maybe it's it's only 0.5 of a big blind
.6 of a big blind difference
of ev here the issue is that might be
0.5.6 big blinds v
difference across a ton of different
combos which overall
my bet frequency maybe my bet frequency
is supposed to be 60
but i push it up to 70 or 80 just
because i'm bluffing too much
and there i'm losing pretty significant
evs simply because of the misconceptions
that i've already talked about
previously
but anyways i put in the 60 bet
and he calls we can see he's raising
again he's raising
a fairly high frequency again for the
turn
he's raising about 10 percent of the
time overall
a lot of these rays are just coming from
he has some two pairs now
he turns some king jack hands he has
skiing five king 10 is starting to
become a little bit more vulnerable on a
double flush draw board
and there's just a general amount of
hands that are going to want some
protection like specifically these king
10 hands these king queen hands and
whatnot
they basically are going to have a lot
of rivers that they're not going to be
able to get the money in
anyways he calls river comes the
two of clubs
we can see on this river he does have a
pretty
low frequency donk and i think this just
comes around to he has some of these
lower nut flushes and whatnot
we go back to the ranges we are still at
a pretty huge advantage
overall but
we are still we are still checking 53 of
the time
so there are a small subset of hands in
the small blinds range that are going to
want to bet
because we're going to be checking back
a good chunk of hands
but overall again equities are going to
come very close here
but we have a pretty large advantage
especially after he doesn't donk we have
a
very large top end advantage here
so when we go over to the strategy we
can see we
are jamming only the only size we're
using are jamming
and that's probably one of the reasons
that our check frequency is higher
because we're using a larger size
but overall we can see some of my ideas
in the hand were correct we are jamming
some of these spade x hands like these
these double spade hands that are we do
end up jamming a lot of these
the problem is is because it's blind
versus blind we
have a ton of just total air we just
have a ton of air
and if we start jamming these ace four
spades hands we can see it
when we do get here with ace four spades
it just never jams and it's actually a
pretty big ev difference
checking is a 4.92 whereas jamming is
3.61 so we're losing
you know about 1.3 of a big blind here
which is
pretty significant if you run that out
over 100 hands
or a thousand hands or however many
hands you want
it's just it just compounds itself over
and over and over and so
ace four of spades really doesn't need
to bluff here
just because we have so many of these
other
basically just total airy hands and even
some of these low
fi like these 5x hands oh these five
accents are just flushes
but even some like eight four hands and
ten four and ten three and whatnot
they're they're jamming these spade
combos quite frequently and if we just
go back and filter by the spade
the the double spade combos we can see
just a lot of the lowest in spade combos
are just bluff jamming the river
so i don't think i was that far off in
my
in my uh overall strategy on the river
i don't think i i had some very slight
misconceptions which definitely resulted
in
sizable ev differences but
one of the main things i wanted to
actually bring up in this hand
was at first glance i think
that ace four you can just say oh
it's a big blind of of ev loss that's
bad
i'll try not to do that again and then
you end the analysis at that point
and you don't go any deeper into the
solve you don't try to understand okay
well why is ace4
a bad hand a barrel here why should i i
have checked the turn
why what you don't just don't dig deeper
and this is one of the biggest issues
with the
whole movement into learning gto and
learning theoretical poker
is that a lot of people just see this
and they just use it as an answer key
they take their hands they put it in to
their solver or to gto wizard and
whatnot
and they just look at it and they go oh
ace4 was supposed to check
dang it i messed up i'll try to do it
better next time
and then they close gta wizard and they
go play again and they
aren't trying to dig deeper into the
intricacies of okay well
why are we checking this high of a
frequency on the flop are you actually
doing that or
are how are you playing all these other
hands are you if maybe you're
you're checking or you're betting ace
four but
that's a small ev difference and you're
okay but maybe you're also betting a
bunch of other hands that you aren't
supposed to bet either
and you're just completely missing all
this evie that you're
just completely leaving on the table
just because maybe you're over bluffing
this spot because you have a bunch of
misconceptions because you've never dug
deeper into the solve
and just the the it's a criminal thing
to do when you're looking at solves
because
many times maybe in this situation ace
four spades
isn't a a very good combo to jam but
maybe if we didn't have all these air
hands all of a sudden ace four spades is
a good hand
handed jam and if you don't understand
why
the specific things are happening and
how all of these hands come together and
how the overall range is made up
you're going to end up completely
ruining your strategy in tons of
different places
and so it's going to be very important
to
one start to understand the actual
principles behind
why your hand is doing what it's doing
where is the ev of your hand coming from
why are certain frequencies being taken
and why is this hand at 30
frequency and this hand's a 90 frequency
there's a reason
the solver chose that hand at higher
frequency for a very specific reason
and you have to figure it out and one of
the best parts about learning theory
is that you don't have to memorize a lot
of different things
many times you can just know what the
strategy is
intuitively once you have understood
tons of theoretical principles
once you understand why each hand is
doing what it's doing all of a sudden
you can take a similar spot
because you understand all the
principles of a spot that you studied
earlier
you can take a completely different spot
apply some of those same principles
and see okay this principle may apply
here but maybe this principle doesn't
and so i'm going to adjust like this
and as you go through your entire career
your overall intuition just gets better
and better and better
and you're able to make these really
well thought out educated guesses
while you're playing in a hand with only
a 15 second or 20 second time bank
and you're much closer you just get
closer and closer to gto
but you never get there if you're only
looking at the solve
as an answer key you're just never going
to get to
a place where you can intuitively tell
someone oh
this hand bet 60 of the time and these
are the reasons why
you'll never be able to get there unless
you start actually analyzing these
solves in a really in-depth way
and so i think it would have been very
easy for me to
just kind of go through this hand and be
like oh i should have probably just
checked the river here
what a pun i'm not good okay let's move
on and go play again
but i would have missed a lot of evie
that i could have gained and this is why
i'm showing this hand
and why i'm trying to relay this
information to you guys as well because
this is one of the things that has
helped me learn poker
in 2021 like 20-21 basically
everyone is studying solves and you have
to be better theoretically than them
especially if you want to move up to
stakes that are respectable and you are
going to be able to make a
high amount of a very high hourly
but i appreciate everyone watching this
video hopefully some of the
end rant that i had is helpful to you
guys
and if you have any questions leave a
comment or join the gto wizard discord
and at me if you have any questions as
well and
i will try to respond to any comments
that you leave
i appreciate you guys watching this and
i'll see you soon
you
