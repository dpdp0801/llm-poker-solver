### TOPIC: how to crush poker
winning at poker in 2025 isn't about luck 
it's about staying ahead the best players  
aren't just studying the game they're 
evolving with it they study smarter  
adjust faster and make better decisions 
Under Pressure this video is your road  
map to mastering the three cornerstones of 
Elite Poker performance strategy study and  
mindset you'll learn how top players 
fine-tune their approach refine their  
study process and develop the mental Edge 
needed to crush highle competition let's dive
in well this is different hi everyone I'm Tomos 
21 head coach for GTO Wizard and I don't normally  
show my face on screen personally I prefer to be 
behind the mic and concentrate on what I'm showing  
on the screen but I've been told that people 
might like my videos better if I put a webcam on  
there so I figured let's try it now if you've 
been around DT wizard you might have seen my  
work before if not welcome uh now you can finally 
put a face to the voice but that's enough of that  
let's get into why you're really here how to 
actually Crush poker in 2025 let's get into
it what makes a Crusher in 2025 it's not just 
about knowing a good strategy or studying more  
or tilting less the Reales they've mastered 
three things how they play how they study and  
how they think see it's not about the outcome 
it's about refining the process that leads to a  
better outcome they know how to apply Unstoppable 
strategies at the table adapting exploiting and  
making Fearless decisions secondly they approach 
study like an engineer breaking the game down  
sharpening The Edge and studying efficiently and 
third they've built an indestructible mindset  
one that can handle tilt manage emotions and 
stay sharp Under Pressure these are the three  
cornerstones of a winning poker player and today 
we're going to break them down all right quick  
pause if you're seeing this congrats you found 
an Easter egg you're here watching this video  
because you want to crush poker in 2025 so here's 
your challenge what's the biggest change you're  
making to your game this year drop your answer in 
the pin comment and I'll randomly pick 15 of you  
to win a one month premium GT wizard subscription 
on February 12th good luck applying Unstoppable  
strategies there are four key things you need 
to become a dominant poker player the first  
is strong fundamentals so you need a rock solid 
foundation because without that everything else  
crumbles secondly you need an adapter die mindset 
if you've been playing the same strategy for too  
long maybe it's time to update that if you don't 
adjust and try and exploit your opponents Maybe  
may this is the year to try poker is a game where 
you either sink or swim so adapt or die thirdly  
you need to be willing to face hard decisions head 
on many players kind of avoid difficult decisions  
and they'll adjust their strategy in such a way 
that they won't have to make difficult decisions  
on future streets which is often going to be a 
mistake lastly you need to have the discipline  
to break free from autopilot which is the seame 
curse that most people suffer from when you're  
just button- clicking all right let's get into it 
Master the fundamentals if you don't have a strong  
Foundation nothing else matters now I'm not saying 
that you need to be some math wizard you don't  
need to calculate everything at the table and try 
and what's the EV of 66 no you don't need to do  
any of that but you do need to at least understand 
the basic Mis Mission critical Concepts first what  
do I mean by that there are certain mathematical 
Concepts in poker such as if your opponent bets  
bigger you are not obliged to defend as wide to 
prevent their blust from profiting right so if  
they bet big you can fold more you don't have to 
but you can you can get away with that without  
being exploitable another example is if you bet 
bigger you're supposed to Bluff more often you  
need to have some basic grasp of combinatorics 
like roughly what percentage of my opponent's  
range is going to be trips on a paired board 
you need to have it even if you don't know that  
number you should have a feel for that right um 
and so without kind of these basic fundamentals  
you just can't master the game so this is what I 
would argue is one of the first steps next next  
let's talk a little bit about GTO and exploitative 
principles so most coaches will tell you that uh  
you need a GTO baseline from which to recognize 
and attack exploits so like oh I know my opponent  
is not playing GTO here's how they're deviating 
here's how I'm going to attack them um but the  
truth is it goes both ways like it's very hard to 
look at a solver output and understand what the  
heck the solver is doing without having some sort 
of exploitative training um because GTO solves  
are built out of exploitative simulation and so 
the potential exploits in the position actually  
inform the Nash equilibrium strategy and so what 
I'm saying is don't study GTO and don't just lean  
on exploits you need both together two sides of 
the same coin next think in ranges not just hands  
now the thing to keep in mind is that poker is a 
game of beian updates so what I mean by that is  
that when your opponent makes some action they're 
representing a range of hands with that action  
and so their range represents your belief about 
what they're doing here and similarly your range  
in a silver represents what they believe about 
you right so that's all ranges are they're just  
beliefs really and whenever you or your opponent 
make an action you're updating those beliefs so  
the best players in the world every last one 
of them are thinking in terms of ranges non  
onstop and they're very very good at narrowing 
down ranges based on the action sequence most  
novices either just play their hand or they 
get to the point where they can think about  
the range pre- flop but they can't really update 
it based on the post flop action but if you want  
to get really good you absolutely must learn 
how to think through and do a range analysis um  
all the way to the river and lastly textures so 
textures dictate strategies what I mean by this  
is that the the board text will determine how 
you can play based on things like range and not  
Advantage um based on what hands are available 
and what hands will probably come up on future  
streights so you need to kind of break it down 
by different types of Textures in order to make  
studying more efficient because if you try and 
study every single board at once you're going  
to go crazy right so monotone boards play very 
specific way paired boards play very specific  
way ace high dry boards play very spefic spefic 
way like you know midc connected boards play  
a very specific way so there's different types 
of textures and if you've ever played poker you  
probably already have a pretty strong intuition 
for this but you need to kind of Chunk it out like  
that in order to make your study more efficient 
adapt or die poker is a very quickly evolving  
game and if you don't evolve with the times you 
will be naturally selected out of the player pool  
lucky for you there are exploitative opportunities 
everywhere everyone's imbalanced there's money to  
be made if you're looking to make it the issue 
is that most players either don't study or if  
they do study they're trying to approximate 
some very bad version of a Nash equilibrium  
strategy that's actually still quite exploitable 
and in doing so missing all of the actual EV by  
failing to exploit their opponent's mistakes hear 
me I'm not saying GTO is bad I'm not saying trying  
to play a Nash equilibrium strategy is bad I 
explained earlier it's two sides of the same coin  
what I'm saying is the number one mistake I see 
most like mid Stakes players making even low  
stakes is that they're trying to play this like 
fixed pseudo equilibrium strategy and then just  
not thinking about all of the ways their opponent 
is screwing up and that's the wrong mindset which  
brings me to my next Point play the player not 
just the spot learning the spot is good learning  
the GTL strategy for spot is better but learning 
that you shouldn't play against a nits the same  
way you should play against the manum back is 
probably even more important right and adjustments  
are in arms race right so poker's Dynamic when you 
adjust smart opponents in fact most people will  
start adjusting back to you unless you're playing 
like Anonymous games they're going to counter you  
can't just expect your opponents to sit there and 
and not change what they're doing against you so  
you need to kind of pay attention to what your 
image says about you and how your opponents might  
be deviating to attack their perceived version of 
what you are if that makes sense and lastly use  
node locking to engineer exploits uh now this is 
the hard part because it requires learning how to  
use one of the more advanced solver tools luckily 
we have a couple great videos for it I'll show  
it here and here on the screen and that way you 
guys can go check those out and learn more about  
how to use node locking to create a very powerful 
strategy face hard decisions head-on many players  
kind of avoid tough spots all the time like I knew 
this one guy that would just always fold flush  
draws and straight draws like even combo draws 
in three bet pots to a second Barrel um because  
he just didn't want the variance and he didn't 
want to make that really difficult play on the  
next street the truth is guys that most people are 
avoiding tough decisions because they lead to pain  
later on and decision fatigue and while avoiding 
decision fatigue is a very natural response if  
you always Dodge these tough spots you're going to 
cap your growth right you need to be able to take  
on these difficult challenges sometimes in order 
to grow as a player and discomfort is a sign of  
growth now I'm not saying you should take every 
difficult spot time EV matters so I would rather  
have a better hourly than big blinds per 100 um 
so you got to pick your battles wisely but the key  
here is to eliminate fear-based avoidance right 
you want to avoid a spot based on a strategic  
Choice rather than out of a fear-based habit 
hope that makes sense break free from autopilot  
autopilot is probably the number one reason most 
players hit a skill ceiling they learn a decent  
strategy it's a solid strategy but then you know 
you start multi-tabling and then you're just kind  
of playing the same strategy all the time and 
again autopilot isn't the enemy it's kind of a  
natural response that uh reduces decision fatigue 
and so everyone autopilots to some degree but the  
important thing here is that you need to learn 
how to come out of autopilot for those important  
like critical spots and really think through 
those spots uh so Pros use kind of a selective  
autopilot to slow down in critical spots and 
really focus in on their play whether or not  
sure now as a beginner there's going to be 
a lot more spots where you're unsure and so  
you generally should be slowing down just all 
around right another way you can tackle this  
is to Mark important spots for review later on 
because even if you can't think through the spot  
right now even if you don't have enough time or 
stamina to do that marking it and then thinking  
through it later will still help you right and 
so if you're not marking spots in your session  
you're probably just leaving money on the table 
because it's a really important part of your
growth chapter two engineering a winning approach 
Improvement isn't random it's a structured process  
and the best Pros they're not just optimizing 
what they're studying they're optimizing how  
they're studying now there are five key things 
I've noticed every Pro does firstly they focus  
on why rather than what and the reason is that if 
you don't know why a play is happening then you  
don't know why you should be playing it right 
so rather than trying to memorize outputs you  
want to learn why the solver is saying you should 
bet this hand here uh secondly gamify your study  
routine now GT wizard is chocked full of amazing 
study tools but let's face it they're work it  
feels like work and the truth is that it's not 
sustainable longterm to try and practice every  
day you need to find ways to make studying more 
fun to make it more efficient uh to gamify the  
experience a bit and make it enjoyable because 
if it's not enjoyable you won't be able to do  
it consistently third invest in your Edge whether 
that be through a coach learning the latest tools  
buying the latest book or just watching the rest 
of this YouTube video investing in your Edge is  
the most plus EV thing you can do if you plan to 
play a lot of Poker in your lifetime fourth focus  
on what matters there's a million spots to study 
a million Concepts and a million blocker effects  
but the truth is that only a handful of these have 
a big impact on your win rate and in this video  
I'm going to show you how to identify those spots 
and how to quantify and prioritize what spots to  
practice next lastly learn where your eveve comes 
from you see I don't actually care if ace5 is  
betting cure or what Deuces is doing or King 6 the 
strategy is not as meaningful to me as the idea of  
how these hands are making money right and if you 
can't figure out how they're making money then do  
you really understand why they're making those 
plays in the first place but it's not that easy  
right like a silver is not going to just tell you 
oh it's making money because of this and that you  
have to go look and figure it out I would argue 
number five is is the hardest part but also one  
of the most critical steps to understanding solver 
outputs and creating Unstoppable strategies learn  
why not what focus on principles not just solver 
outputs I want to know why the silver is making  
this play now it's not always obvious but if 
you only focus on memorization you won't get  
anywhere because there's too many spots there's 
too many hands you can't memorize it all you're  
just human right it's much more efficient to 
figure out oh it's doing this because reason  
and then apply that puristic to a wide variety of 
spots right that's a far more efficient studying  
routine than oh I bet ace5 in this three bet 
pot in this check check double barrel line  
you need to go wider right especially when 
you're newer so ask why the silver makes  
certain plays don't just copy it try to figure out 
the underlying reasoning one of the best ways to  
do this is to experiment with the inputs and see 
how the outputs change so we have cause we have  
effect right and you want to try and map cause to 
effect together understanding what changing these  
inputs does to these outputs lets you build up an 
internal model of how to play poker and so when  
you're examples of this would be changing the 
ranges uh changing the BET sizing changing the  
rake node locking all of these are examples 
where we are changing the input parameters  
and seeing how it affects the output strategy 
right and so just by experimenting with those  
inputs and those outputs you can build up a much 
stronger internal model and kind of build your  
brain solver as it were gamify your study routine 
many coaches myself included have made the mistake  
of suggesting overly ambitious studying routines 
to our students you know you got to do 500 drills  
in a Range Builder and review your hands and all 
this you know 100 push-ups 100 sit-ups 100 squats  
and a 10 kmet run every single day it's too much 
we have very limited bandwidth as humans like the  
truth is that it's much better to build a routine 
that you can actually stick to for many years and  
a long time than it is to study your ass off for 
like a week and then never again right so the  
best way to do this is to learn how to gamify your 
study routine uh most players use some mixture of  
reviewing their hands practicing drills um going 
through the solver reviewing with friends Etc  
the best ways I found are to kind of track your 
progress to stay motivated to see like okay I'm  
improving in this spot do things like compete with 
friends set goals structure challenges anything  
with your poker friends is going to be more fun 
so I suggest checking out our Discord we actually  
have a bunch of study groups in there that can 
make it a much more enjoyable experience to learn  
together you can do things like create a drill 
send it to your poker friends and see who does  
better in these spots or just review hands and 
laugh at the crazy plays you make together poker  
can be lonely so it's important to try and do it 
with friends and try and make it more enjoyable  
rather than going at it as a lone wolf invest 
in your Edge a lot of players will tell me well  
I don't know if I want to hire a coach or get a 
GTA Wiz subscription or buy this latest book or  
this course because my bank rooll is this uh and 
here's where I am but this is kind of a very naive  
mindset right think about how many more hands of 
poker you're going to play in your lifetime is  
it a thousand 100,000 a million 10 million like 
how many more hands do you want to play at this  
current level of skill when you could be playing 
at this level of skill so why wouldn't you invest  
earlier on rather than waiting until you're 
already playing high stakes to start investing  
you're intentionally choosing like the slowest 
possible path if you want it like streamline and  
get the quickest progress possible you need to 
invest as early on and possible into your own  
Edge now how do you do this well there's lots of 
free material check out our blog or our YouTube  
page I'm very proud of our writers and the people 
making YouTube videos for us I think we build  
some of the highest level poker content on the 
internet for free I mean like Bar None now we  
also have some structured study plans again those 
are free you can just go check them out and if  
you're a premium member you can go check out our 
highle coaching seminars every week we have a ton  
of recordings at some point in your life you might 
want to hire a coach I'd recommend checking out  
this two plus two page there's lots of coaches 
here you can kind of see what their rates are  
what other people are saying about them what they 
specialize in you can kind of find a coach that  
fits your need and at some point you'll probably 
want to learn how to use a solver like GTR wizard  
right so that's kind of the service we offer a 
One-Stop shop to take you from amateur to Pro um  
and so we've got GTO Solutions we've got node 
locking tools we've got trainers and coaching  
seminars you can upload your hand histories uh you 
can practice building your entire range or playing  
one hand at a time there's a ton of features 
and it's all designed to kind of take you from  
beginner to expert that said the biggest thing 
you can do is just start investing in your Edge  
today rather than waiting until you're already 
a highle player right just by tick focus on  
what matters there are a million things to study 
and not enough time to study them so one of the  
biggest challenges with building modern poker 
tools is figuring out how to prioritize what's  
important the truth is that not all studies 
created equal and spending time on the right  
things is what separates El players from the rest 
you need to prioritize high impact areas of the  
game because the truth is that some spots occur 
far more frequently and have a far bigger impact  
on your win rate than many other spots so there's 
tons of spots that are like barely important and a  
few spots that are very important and so learning 
to quantify that and saying this is the spot you  
should study next then this spot is just going to 
have a much bigger impact than your win rate right  
a very simple example of this is the fact that AI 
boards occur way more often than monotone boards  
on the Flop and so if you're starting out and 
you're like well I don't know how to play either  
maybe start with one that occurs more often so 
I'll show you a simple spreadsheet application  
that I've built here to help you prioritize post 
flop spots and kind of Chunk them together in a  
way that they're somewhat strategically similar 
all right guys this is my spot importance  
spreadsheet now you might have seen the V3 version 
of this um this one is specific ly designed for  
six Max cache players but here's how it works 
right we've got all of these formations button  
versus bitland single race pot uh small blind 
versus big blind four bet pot under the gun  
versus hijack three bet pot cut off versus button 
cold call single race pot like there's all of  
these different spots that can occur in a six Max 
cach game but how do we know which one to study  
well one approach is to figure out which spot is 
more frequent so as you can see like button versus  
big blind this is way more frequent than under 
the gun versus big blind for bed pot right so  
the frequency of a spot matters but also so does 
the starting size of the pot yeah this one down  
here is way less common but the average pot size 
and the starting pot size are both much bigger  
and so you can kind of multiply the frequency by 
the pot size to figure out the the expected value  
of some spot as in you can think of this like an 
importance metric as in how much it matters or how  
much it affects your EV and then for each of these 
what you can do is type in your GTO Wizard score  
or your EV loss as a percentage of the pot per 
hand whatever metric you like and based on this  
it's going to update the practice priority so let 
me give you an example let's say you go and study  
some single race pots and you get pretty good and 
you bump all of these up to let's say 80% right  
80% 80 not 800 t go and just type in my GT Wizard 
score and what this does is it says okay you got  
pretty good at these single race pots let's change 
our priority so I'm going to change this up okay  
now it's time to be practicing some button versus 
blind three bed pots right and so we'll bump those  
up a little bit say we get 80 and 80 and it's 
like okay what's the next most important spot  
well again I'll just sort by practice priority 
uh it's blind versus blind forb pots right and  
you just keep going like this and slowly improving 
one step at a time now I guess some feedback I had  
about the previous version of the sheet I made is 
that this is too many spots right there's just so  
many different spots so what you can do instead 
is kind of group them into like grouped drills  
so for example here we have late position versus 
blind three bit pot so given my current priorities  
this is my highest priority and so this would 
be like cut off and button versus some of the  
blinds and you can actually change this like 
there's a there's a settings tab in here I've  
got hidden somewhere but yeah you can like Define 
what group name is assigned to each position um  
for to create these group drills and you can also 
change these up to get like to create new types of  
drills and so if you change these parameters it 
will automatically create new drills for you and  
the cool thing is you can actually just click this 
and it's going to open up a GTO wizard solution  
that allows you to just go and directly trade 
in this spot and so you can go right from this  
to this and similarly if you want to drill down 
on each of these particular formations the drill  
and the aggregate report is right next to it so 
it's very convenient in that sense but here for  
example we can see the aggregate report across 
all flops for this blind versus blind for bed  
pot spot by having that immediate access to go 
from like this is what needs work to here's the  
drill here's the aggregate report you can build 
some really efficient study you know I need to  
improve blind versus blind forb bet pots here's 
the aggregate reports what are some patterns I  
notied right let's start filtering for for example 
paired boards how are we playing paired boards  
right what about monotone boards and so you can 
start building your big hero sticks this way and  
then you can dive in and start practicing that 
spot directly and so this is my attempt to try  
and make studying as easy and as intuitive as 
possible for all post flop formations now a lot  
of people have asked what about like other formats 
you know straddle and anti MTT Etc and those are  
things I'd like to come out with um eventually 
but since six Max cash is my specialty I figured  
this is the one I want to release first so anyway 
I've also got these charts here these are kind of  
fun what these do is they they show you the 
the sum of practice priority as it were and  
so for example let me focus on this one here most 
important spots uh when we're grouping them by the  
aggressor position and pre- flop action so IP SRP 
means in position single race pot so the aggressor  
is in position and we're playing a single race pot 
this grouping is going to be uh the most important  
when you're just starting out right so this is 
like button versus big blind single race pot cut  
off versus big blind single race pot Etc then we 
have out of position three bet pot why would it  
be out of why is out of position more important 
well because generally uh you you three bet more  
out of the blinds and you three bet bigger out of 
the blinds so that tends to be more important than  
in position three bet pot which is down here uh 
then out of position four bet pot as well and so  
you you can kind of see these different groupings 
and see which formations are the most important  
to study position wise keep mind I've reset all 
of these so that it's the same thing so every  
spot is now we're getting an equal score on it so 
the just kind of reset the the practice priority  
but down here we can see like most important 
positions unsurprisingly big blind is is the  
most important and this kind of aligns with modern 
poker Theory this is where you lose the most money  
this is where you make the most plays so getting 
that right is important followed by button one of  
the widest positions but also kind of makes up the 
majority of your win ratees then small blind cut  
off hijacking under the gun um so you get kind 
of some some surprising orderings out of here  
um a lot of people ask like what's more important 
single race pots three bet pots or four B pots  
well by going through this method I found that 
three bet pots are less important individually  
but there are more formations of three red pots 
than there are formations of single race pots  
so perhaps too many people are over invested in 
single R pots and haven't developed their strategy  
in three bit pots enough and then just kind of 
however you slice it for by pots are just going  
to be less important overall until you've like 
you don't want to dive into four bed pots until  
you've spent a decent amount of time in single 
race pots and three pots uh but the beauty of  
this method is that it'll make it kind of obvious 
like when one of these needs to improve and then  
over here we have the most important spots grouped 
so like these are your own groupings that you can  
create um you can change these by the way like 
you can change the group name so that they make  
more sense to you in settings so let's say that 
it's kind of weird to group small blind and big  
blind into one group because play so differently 
so I might just write them out like that uh in  
which case you'll get like different groupings 
here right anyway that's the new spot importance  
sheet I think it's a really cool study tool I hope 
you guys like it if you have any suggestions for  
improvements let me know in the comments down 
below um to use it you can just go file make a  
copy and then just start typing in your own 
GTR wizard scores or alternatively again you  
can type in your EV loss as a percentage of Pop 
hand which is a standard metric uh you can find  
in GTO wizard as well learn where Eevee comes 
from the best players know exactly where their  
Edge comes from and how to maximize it and this 
is true for every hand class so the truth is that  
it's not important how you play a hand it's 
important that you understand how your hand  
makes money right now how do you see that it's not 
obvious in a solver if you go look at the expected  
value for some hand you'll see how much money 
it's making but you won't see how to make that  
money that makes sense right so in practice what 
this often involves is zoning into some particular  
hand class and navigating from flop to River in 
a bunch of main lines and seeing how it plays  
out and how this hand actually wins and where you 
end up folding doing this will teach you how your  
hand makes EV in standard lines but along the way 
you'll probably notice things like wait would my  
opponent actually do that are they going to find 
this hero call or make this massive fold probably  
not and when that happens maybe you should go node 
loock those mistakes and see how your hand class  
changes its strategy to exploit that in general I 
recommend applying the scientific method to Poker  
and the weakest like the most basic version of 
this is just change the input see what happens  
to the output right input output cause effect if 
you understand cause and effect you understand  
what drives good strategy I have a a coaching 
video on this it's called applying the scientific  
method to Poker if you want to learn more about 
hypothesis building and a more rigorous way to  
approach poker but in general I recommend just 
being playful change the inputs change the rake  
change the BET size see what happens along the 
way and really don't just focus on one street try  
and go all the way to the river because that's 
how you're going to learn how your hand drives
money that brings us to chapter 3 the men game 
forging an indestructible mindset the truth is  
that you can have the best strategy and the best 
study routine and none of that matters if you fall  
apart Under Pressure poker's a game of decisions 
and the biggest Edge comes from those who make  
the best decisions when the pressure is high most 
people don't do this the best players don't just  
think clearly when things are going well they know 
how to stay composed and unshaken when everything  
is going wrong so first we'll talk a little bit 
about setting goals you want to set goals you can  
control uh this is because when you focus on 
execution over results you get a much better  
more stable mindset secondly you need to learn 
how to regroup when your game slips and everyone  
tilts that's fine learning how to take it from a 
mistake to snowballing out of control is a really  
important skill every poker player needs to learn 
don't suppress your emotions right in general  
emotions are data and that's not a bad thing they 
just tell you things about yourself about how your  
mind operates it's better to process rather than 
suppress your emotions level up your lifestyle the  
truth is that your brain is your most important 
asset as a poker player and if you're not doing  
kind of like the soft skills that are needed to 
make good decisions like sleeping and eating well  
you're not going to make good decisions right 
if you live like crap you're not going to be  
able to think straight simple as that right and 
lastly leave ego out of the equation ego's kind of  
like the silent bankroll killer Um poker has this 
weird sense of punishing entitlement uh punishing  
stubbornness and punishing Pride so the sooner you 
learn to let go of ego the faster you'll improve  
okay let's get into it set goals you can control 
in poker you can't control the outcome of a hand  
but you can control how you played the hand so 
what you really need to do is learn to detach from  
the results so that you can focus on execution 
this comes down to like things like control theory  
and focusing on your inner circle of influence um 
rather than obsessing about oh this was such a bad  
run out or I got so unlucky try to focus more 
on how did I play the hand did I make the best  
play with the information I had at the time and 
this is going to shift your mindset from winning  
to Mastery right you want to be focusing in on 
like I played this really well um I'm really  
proud of my discipline and my consistency those 
are the things that are going to affect your win  
ratees in the long run you can't control whether 
or not you get cooler but you can control uh how  
well you played before you got it all in you 
know so control what you can and just let go  
of the rest your job is to try and execute at 
the highest level every hand every session and  
everything else is up to chance regroup when 
your game slips everyone tilts the key is to  
recognize tilt before it takes over one bad 
decision doesn't have to lead to five you also  
should recognize that there are different types 
of tilt tilt isn't just about getting unlucky  
there's also such a thing as like winners tilt 
for example where you're on such a hot streak  
that you start making terrible decisions Revenge 
tilt where you're just out to like punish some  
player we've got a whole video out about it but 
in general what you want to do is learn to step  
away and reset at the right time if you're not 
thinking clearly take a break now if you're not  
on gorilla tilt but you're just kind of you've 
sense that you've lost Focus maybe you feel  
like you just got too oued and you can feel the 
anxiety flaring up what you can do is something  
called a little micro reset these are things 
like a deep breath a quick break uh just the  
way to kind of mentally reframe and get back to 
your standard State you don't want to let that  
pressure kind of build up and up and up and just 
sit there and fester what you want to do is kind
of okay I'm back right little Motions like this 
can help your session out and will prevent small  
mistakes from snowballing and avalanching 
into like terrible sessions don't suppress  
your emotions a lot of poker players will go 
into kind of a zombie like States in order to  
prevent the anxiety from becoming overwhelming 
or or just because maybe maybe they've played  
a lots and they're trying to multiable and 
autopilot the truth is that with tilt it's  
much better to allow yourself to feel the 
Tilt allow yourself to feel the emotion and  
then let it go than it is to try and not feel 
the emotion at all so let the let the feeling  
come in and then let it subside rather than 
pushing it away right because that's that's not  
going to help remember guys emotions are data 
not threats emotions are information that you  
can use to identify what needs fixing in your 
game um so acknowledge the emotion process it  
and then move on everyone will experience these 
but you don't have to let it control your play  
lastly reduce decision fatigue so poker is kind 
of like an endurance sport similar to let's say  
Esports or golf or chess where you're making a 
lot of like mental decisions very often and that  
is fatiguing it's actually quite tiring even like 
ESPN proof that like world champion chess players  
burn a bunch of calories because it's like a 
really high mental energy thing so what your  
mind will naturally do is find ways to reduce 
decision fatigue by autop piloting by zombieing  
by button- clicking what I recommend is that 
you you allow yourself to play automatically  
in most standard spots but you got to be able to 
like bring it in and really focus when you're in  
important spots right so it's okay to reduce 
decision fatigued but don't let that autopilot  
your game level up your lifestyle your mind 
is your most valuable asset so invest into it  
like you would your Edge and protect it like you 
would your bankroll things like sleep diet and  
exercise directly affect your ability to make good 
decisions at the poker table at the end of the day  
poker is a mental game and you need to optimize 
your mind as you would your strategy generally  
energy management is greater than time management 
when it comes to poker your focus endurance and  
tilt resistance come from how well you take care 
of yourself off the table a balanced life leads  
to balanced play as they say anecdotally I don't 
know if you guys have seen that ESPN article about  
highle chess players there was something in there 
about like World Championship level chess burning  
6,000 calories a day or something absurd like 
that people don't understand how taxing it is  
to play a highle mental game for many many hours 
continuously it takes a lot of energy it takes a  
lot of effort so there is some level to you can 
call it like a thinking stamina if you would but  
it just goes to show like many of the highlevel 
Esports players high level chess players high  
level poker players they are actively investing 
in their health because they understand that  
good health leads to better decisions leads 
to healthier brain and therefore sharper play  
leave ego out of it ego is the enemy of 
improvement it makes you justify bad plays instead  
of learning from them when frustration hits follow 
this process feel it process it then detach from  
it your emotions are real but they don't have to 
change the EV of your decisions remember you're  
not entitled to win variance doesn't care how well 
you played and I don't care if you have a range  
advantage that doesn't entitle you to the pot 
generally poker tends to punish ego and rewards  
adaptable players if you can stay objective while 
other players would tilt in your shoes you'll have  
an edge even before the cards are dealt that was 
a lot of material and if you guys are still here  
I'm proud of you if you skip to the end because 
you wanted the Keynotes well here they are play  
dynamically and bravely you need to adapt exploit 
and make Fearless High e plays and you can't be  
afraid to change your style or get exploited you 
have to be willing to change in order to improve  
study smarter not harder memorization doesn't make 
you a great player understanding why plays work  
understanding how to use solvers correctly and 
how to make study engaging is what accelerates  
your growth as a player and lastly Mastery mental 
game tilt fear and ego are your biggest enemies  
you need to stay composed detach from the results 
and focus on execution and making the best best  
decision every time rather than obsessing over 
the outcomes of the hand this video was adapted
