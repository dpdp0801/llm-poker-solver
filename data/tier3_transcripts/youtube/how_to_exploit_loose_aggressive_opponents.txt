### TOPIC: how to exploit loose aggressive opponents
have you ever had a player at your table 
who was so aggressive you knew that they  
couldn't possibly always have a 
strong hand but you weren't sure  
how to actually fight back we've all 
been in that situation at some point  
so if you want to know how to react next 
time it happens this video is for [Music]
you hi Wizards I'm Matt hunt and this video is 
all about battling The Maniacs those players  
at your table who give you nightmares with 
their continued insistence on always playing  
aggressively no matter what and seemingly never 
backing down when you do fight back we're going  
to focus primarily on mtts but the principles 
we're discussing will also be relevant for cash  
games especially when we look at some deeper 
stacked adjustments let's start by defining  
what we mean by a maniac at least in strategic 
terms what we're really focusing on is Players  
whose overall aggression levels are far too high 
across all parts of the game tree and who will  
generally be putting in far too much betting 
volume as a whole this means not only betting  
too often but also betting too big in certain 
spots where small bets are much more effective  
in addition we're also going to assume that our 
Maniac is prone to underfolding to our aggression  
on the earlier streets in other words we're going 
to assume that they're not just automatically  
backing down as soon as we show any aggression 
ourselves after all if they were betting at a  
high frequency but then overfolded to raises they 
wouldn't be anywhere near as difficult to play  
against finally we're also going to assume that 
their bething ranges are somewhat too merged in  
many situations this essentially means they'll be 
taking a lot of middle strength hands and beting  
them in situations where they're not functioning 
clearly as value bets or Bluffs now one caveat  
here is that while GTO wizard AI will give us 
a great level of insight into how we should  
approach these players we're not easily going to 
be able to account for predicting our opponent's  
aggression levels on future streets for the most 
part we're going to stick to exploring our options  
in ways which we can do quickly and efficiently 
using the AI as opposed to to running Sims which  
might take hours or even days to complete so let's 
meet our subject for this video our archetypal  
Maniac player profile Wizards this is Steve Steve 
is 25 years old although this photo maybe looks a  
little older than that from the USA and Steve is 
what we would call a trust fun kid Steve's parents  
are billionaires and he loves gambling with his 
parents' Money Steve doesn't care about winning  
and losing he knows he's probably not a winning 
poker player but that doesn't bother him Steve  
loves the game and he particularly loves winning 
big pots showing down big Bluffs and putting his  
opponents in Nightmare spots for this reason he 
will always bet if you check to him no matter what  
and he never bets less than half pot Steve's least 
favorite thing to do at the poker table is folding  
it takes a lot of effort to make Steve fold any 
kind of draw and if he has a pair he's not going  
to fold it unless you're betting at least two 
times the pot so what's our Pathway to maximizing  
our against thieve well it all starts pre flop 
and we can explore it using GTO wizard AI heads up  
pre- flop solver even though we're not necessarily 
going to be playing heads up against Steve  
simplifying the game can help us get a pretty good 
idea of the general principles we'll need to obey  
if we're going to maximize our EV against him the 
general approach we're going to take when heads up  
against Steve is designed to help us figure out 
our overall exploitative framework for playing  
against him and establish where our additional 
EV is coming from when playing against him in a  
full ring or six Max environment we're obviously 
not going to be able to use the same ranges as we  
would when heads up but we will be able to use 
the same overall approach to extracting more EV  
from Steve so our strategies will translate fairly 
well we'll Begin by assuming we're deep stacked at  
around 200 big blinds we're not incorporating 
an anti but that doesn't matter since we're  
just looking at the principles here we'll imagine 
Steve is the in position player pre flop and he's  
going to open to three big blinds on the button 
let's see how our three bet strategy from Outer  
position is going to change depending on exactly 
how wide Steve's opening range is this will give  
us a sense of how the width of an opening range 
is going to alter our defense strategy even when  
villain is opening larger and wider than what 
would be optimal I've allowed us a set of six  
potential three bet sizes here everywhere from 
three times the open size all the way up to  
eight times our goal here is to look at how the 
width of the opening range affects our three bet  
strategy against this large open size so that 
we can get a baseline idea of what we should do  
at Deep Stacks when our opponent is both opening 
wider and larger than what would be optimal this  
graphic shows us how our use of each of the sizes 
Alters as the width of the opening range changes  
with the opening frequency on the left from 25 up 
to 100% and our total 3 Bet frequency in the last  
column on the right with the distribution in each 
of the other columns it's obvious that our three  
bet frequency is going to go up as the opening 
range gets wider but the most interesting part  
of this graphic is that there's a heavy shift 
toward the smaller sizings as well now here's  
the same information in chart form you can see the 
changes in the distribution of our sizes a little  
better here against the tighter opening range 
the no clear Trend in three bet sizing but as  
the range gets wider there's a clear preference 
for the smaller sizes of nine big blinds and 12  
big blinds since villain has a lot more very weak 
hands which can't continue even versus a smaller  
three bet so it would seem that against players 
who open two wide we should three bet slightly  
smaller right well actually it's not that simple 
because the player profile we're talking about  
here isn't just opening too wide they're also 
underfolding versus our three bets and probably  
four betting too much as well so let's step by 
step and figure out what the best course of action  
is versus that specific type of player first let's 
look at an extreme example what if our opponent  
Steve never folds to a three bet at all we can 
simulate this by simply removing the folding  
option from his side of the game tree and doing 
the same calculations we did before that gives  
us this grid which looks very different to the 
earlier one you'll notice that there's no point  
in showing this Grid in chart form because if we 
know our opponent isn't folding there's no reason  
to three bet to any size other than the biggest 
one available every frequency between nine big  
blinds and 21 big blinds is zero here at 200 big 
blinds we're probably too deep to just simply Jam  
all in but later on we'll look at the 50 big blind 
stack size and things will be very different there  
I did the same thing for an inos spot with the 
game tree tweak to have us limp 100% of hands and  
villain raise 100% and got more or less the same 
results here are the two strategies side by side  
as you can see if villain opens any two cards and 
never folds to three bat not only are we choosing  
the biggest three betat size available but our 
three bet range also becomes entirely linear  
there are no Bluffs in this range at all or at 
least there's no element of polarization to it  
we're essentially three betting so wide for Value 
that even some of the hands which would usually be  
classed as Bluffs are now value raises like pocket 
3s jack8 suited or ace7 off why does this strategy  
look the way it does to answer that question we 
have to look at Steve's response here which is  
going to lead us down another rabbit hole as you 
can see here when we force Steve to open any two  
cards and never fold to a three bet his response 
is extremely passive What's Happening Here is that  
most of the hands which Steve should be folding 
are weak enough that they can't ever justify for  
betting so he has to just call with them but if 
he calls all those hands the eveve of his entire  
calling range will be much lower so the solver is 
trying to compensate by adding more strong hands  
to his calling range essentially forcing him to 
trap at a much higher rate this is a phenomenon  
I like to refer to as the please don't make me 
play Bad effect we're forcing the solver to do  
something which is clearly a bad idea opening 
any two cards and never folding to a three bet  
so it's going to try to compensate in any way it 
can in order to minimize losses in this case the  
best way for it to do that is to rarely forit and 
trap with most of the strong hands to strengthen  
the flatting range the only hands that do have the 
incentive to for bet here are now the middling to  
strong ones which want to get more money in the 
pot pre- flop but aren't very good at realizing  
Equity post flop mostly the middle and lower 
pocket Pairs and the strongest offit Aces those  
hands simply want to jam all in to put as many 
of our hands in a tough spot as possible since  
a lot of our range is flipping against those 
hands here so in the end Steve's best response  
if he's not allowed to fold is to almost always 
call but sometimes just shove all in for 200 big  
blinds the fact that he's never for betting to 
a smaller size here is directly allowing us to  
three bet a completely linear range this is why 
our strategy of three betting larger and more  
linear looks the way it does we get maximum value 
from his extremely weak calling range and we don't  
get four bet much at all but what if Steve plays a 
completely different strategy what if Steve plays  
a strategy where he never shoves all in but for 
bets to something like three times our three bet  
size would we still prefer our strategy of three 
betting to a large size with a linear range well  
the short answer is yes as this graphic shows 
the main reason for this is because even when  
Steve is not allowed to shove all in his strategy 
of never folding still requires him to trap a lot  
and rarely for bet so his calling frequency versus 
the 3 Bet is still around 95% and we don't have to  
worry about being put in an awkward position 
versus a foret our next step therefore is to  
think about what our strategy will look like if 
Steve is going to forb bet more frequently which  
since he's a maniac we should probably expect to 
happen in practice GTO wizard ai's node loocking  
feature allows us to do this very needly since we 
can simply use the sliders to increase Steve's for  
bet frequency and the solver will automatically 
pick the best hands for him to do it with based  
on the EV of those hands as forb bets this next 
graphic shows how our 3 Bet frequency changes as  
we alter Steve's 4 bet frequency with our 3 Bet 
frequency on the Y AIS and His Four bets on the  
x-axis interestingly there's not a massive change 
one way or the other only a few per either way  
with some slight increases and decreases based on 
how wide Steve's for bet for Value range becomes  
even if Steve is for betting 40% of the time which 
is almost 10 times as often as he's supposed to  
we're still only decreasing our 3 Bet frequency 
by about 3% why is this well it has to do with the  
construction of Steve's forb bet range as you'll 
see in a moment but first let's take a glance at  
our strategy versus the forb BET itself evidently 
we're doing a lot of shoving all in versus this  
for bet which makes a lot of sense given that 
he's for betting to a large size of three times  
our three bet and we're getting a good price to 
be all in and realize our Equity but the other  
interesting thing here is that as soon as Steve is 
for beding more often than the optimal frequency  
of around 5% here we no longer have any folds 
against that forbet this could be a very important  
part of our strategy against Maniacs it's telling 
us that if we already know a player is likely  
to forb bet too aggressively it might be a big 
mistake to have any three bet folds at all however  
the big factor here is the construction of Steve's 
forb bet range as I mentioned a moment ago this  
next image shows us an example of how Steve's forb 
bet range was constructed when I used the slider  
to give him a 40% forb bet frequency it obviously 
looks pretty weird but in a general sense you can  
see that it's a polarized range it has a lot of 
pocket Pairs and strong offsuit ASX hands for  
Value while the bluffing region is anchored around 
a lot of the very weakest offsuit hands with the  
queen de off to eight de off region for betting 
in pure the fact that our three bet frequency  
didn't change very much overall is largely down 
to this Factor when Steve is forb betting a polar  
range he still mostly has fairly clear decisions 
against our for bet Jam calling with his value and  
folding his Bluffs and we still have some fairly 
awkward spots with the in value portion of our  
three betting range which doesn't really want to 
get it in but also doesn't want to fold to a four  
bet in general four betting a polar range from in 
position especially for the big size that Steve  
has chosen would be a fairly good decision for 
Steve here even though the fact that he's never  
folding is obviously already costing him a lot of 
EV but the difficult thing for us here is that a  
lot of these Maniacs don't for bet with polar 
ranges they tend to take an approach primarily  
based on the strength of their hand and don't 
often consider the possibility of a difficult  
spot against future aggression or what happens if 
their opponent shoves all in they simply tend to  
put more money in the pot when they think there's 
a good chance they have the best hand so with that  
in mind let's examine what happens if we make 
Steve's forbat range a much more linear one  
instead this is what it looks like when we have 
Steve for betting more linearly this is the most  
extreme version where he's forb betting the top 
40% of the deck and calling everything else I had  
to select these hands manually since the slider in 
the node lock menu makes decisions according to EV  
as opposed to basic hand strength and here's what 
it does to our frequencies there's a much more  
obvious change in our three bet strategy here to 
begin with the less often Steve is for betting the  
more often we can three bet with a slight reversal 
once his four bet frequency becomes extremely high  
there's about a 14% gap between our aggression 
when he forb bets 5% of the time and when he forb  
bets 40% of the time which is far more significant 
than what we saw before to figure out why this is  
happening we also have to look at our responses to 
the for bet once it does occur now looking at the  
distribution of our frequencies here this is where 
things get really interesting when Steve is for  
betting a very tight and strong top five% range 
we respond with no calls and purely an Allin or  
fold strategy our hand is either strong enough 
to get it all in against this full bet range  
or it doesn't benefit from putting any more 
chips in the pot at all remember also that we  
were three betting more often in this scenario 
to begin with as well on the other end of the  
scale when he's for beding extremely aggressively 
in a linear fashion we already know our initial  
3B frequency has decreased by about 14% from the 
previous graph and now we're seeing that we never  
fold to the 4 bet at all in fact we mostly shove 
all in with only certain specific hands benefiting  
from calling given the awkward price that we're 
getting and the low post flop SP so before we go  
any further let's just take a beat to recap where 
we're at and summarize what we've figured out so  
far we've established that Steve never folds to 
our three bet which means we have a significant  
incentive to three bet larger and more linear in 
our Construction in order to compensate for never  
folding to our three bet Steve should be four 
betting very rarely and protecting his extremely  
wide flatting range by trapping with his strong 
hands but it's probably reasonable to assume he's  
not doing that depending on our exact read on 
what Steve is doing we might have more than one  
plausible option in how we adjust to exploit him 
if he's for betting too much which we've already  
established is likely since he's a maniac but he's 
doing it with a polarized 4 bet range then our  
initial three bet strategy doesn't really change 
we still have a big incentive to three larger  
and more linear to take advantage of his lack of 
folding depending on our exact read on what Steve  
is doing we might have more than one plausible 
option in how we adjust to exploit him if he's for  
beding too much which we've already established is 
likely since he's a maniac but he's doing it with  
a polarized 4 bet range then our initial three 
bet strategy doesn't really change very much we  
still have a big incentive to three bet larger 
and more linear to take advantage of his lack  
of folding but the main difference now is that 
we simply stop folding in to his for bet since  
it contains a lot of extremely weak Bluffs which 
are doing very poorly against our linear three  
bet range however if Steve is for betting too 
aggressively and doing it with a linear range we  
would have to start three betting a tighter range 
but five bet jamming more often when we do three  
bet the goal of this being to put Steve in as many 
difficult spots as possible when he forb Bets with  
a thin value type hand which would usually just 
call our three bet eventually our strategy will  
reach a point where we have no incentive to ever 
fold to his forb bet will e be five bet jamming  
or simply peeling the four bet given the price 
we're getting the reason for this is that as his  
linear 4 bet range expands wider and wider it 
becomes so wide that it becomes a little easier  
for us to sometimes call the forbat and play post 
flop against a tight linear range though we would  
have very little reason to call the four bet and 
try to navigate on future streets but all this is  
making the assumption that Steve never folds to 
the three bet at all and that might be a little  
unrealistic what if he does fold sometimes there 
are a few questions which we need to answer here  
the first one is do our linear three bets gain 
anything from him folding after all a linear  
three bet range is three betting for thin value 
and if we're getting folds we're losing a little  
bit of that value although we're also denying 
him the ability to realize Equity at the same  
rate so the trade-off could be worth it the next 
question is how does his folding frequency affect  
our three bet range do we start altering our 
construction as he begins folding more or does  
our range simply expand and contract well in 
order to answer any of these these questions  
we have to start normalizing his forb frequency 
because if we don't the solver will want him to  
compensate for folding more by altering his 
forb range and frequency and that will throw  
off all of our results this graphic shows us the 
results of tweaking Steve's folding frequency with  
a consistent linear 10% for bet frequency and a 
shifting calling frequency it's worth noting in  
this instance that we had Steve for betting to 
a sizing much larger than what GTO would prefer  
which is why you can see in the right hand column 
that our GTO frequency for calling the forb bet  
in this case would be only around 1% these numbers 
are much more easily interpreted in graph form  
though so let's view them that way this is what 
our graph looks like for this spot on the far left  
we have our strategy for if Steve is only folding 
10% of the time and on the far right we have the  
GTO strategy where Steve is folding at the optimal 
frequency for a three big blind any two cards open  
which would be around 77% given the large sizing 
of our 3 Bet as you can tell from the graph our  
strategy on the left is more evenly distributed 
with more three betting and more folding  
while as we get closer and closer to Steve playing 
a GTO strategy we start three betting less calling  
more and folding slightly less as well this might 
all be difficult to interpret so what's actually  
happening here well it's a few things first we 
know Steve is underfolding to three bets so we  
know he's folding less than the 77% of the time he 
should be in GTO given that he opened with any two  
cards for three big blinds the more Steve starts 
to fold to our three bet the less we have to gain  
by three betting for thin value with certain hands 
which are on on the edge of our value range this  
causes these hands to shift towards calling 
instead this in turn actually strengthens our  
calling range because we're adding in some hands 
at the top of the range consequently this actually  
allows us to start calling slightly wider at the 
bottom of the range because those weaker hands are  
now slightly more protected as we start three Bing 
more for thin value we also have to now fold the  
bottom of our calling range because the fact that 
our calling range is weaker overall means that the  
weakest hands in this range can no no longer 
call profitably when it comes to our response  
against a forbat nothing is changing there Steve's 
forbat strategy stayed consistent throughout these  
examples so the exact hands which call or five bet 
against a four bet have not changed either if he's  
playing a fixed strategy then we should also play 
a fixed strategy so let's develop a full picture  
of Steve's overall pre- flop game and allow us 
to arrive at a final conclusion we think Steve  
is Raising to three big blinds with any two cards 
pre- flop we also believe he's forting a linear  
10% range consisting of the top 10% of hands we 
also think that he's probably only folding to  
three bets around 20% of the time and we don't 
think he's ever going to fold to a shove after  
he for bets obviously we don't have any proof of 
any of this but these are our reads based on what  
we've seen of Steve at our table what do we think 
our final strategy is going to look like feel free  
to pause the video and take a guess or write 
down some aspects of our strategy if you like  
well this is our first snapshot of our 200 big 
blind strategy against Steve from out of position  
with three Bing to that very large 8X size with 
the range you can see on the left and calling  
quite wide as well although not quite every suited 
hand in the deck against Steve's four bet range  
you can see our strategy on the right with five 
bet jamming with nines plus an ace Queen and  
calling with a few other hands but because he's 
forbidding to a large sizing with a fairly linear  
and strong range we're not peeling very often here 
if we switch the positions and create a game tree  
which allows us to be in position things look 
much the same except now our thin value range  
has become much wider and we're now never folding 
a suited hand to a raise obviously this is because  
we're playing in position heads up we shouldn't 
do this in a full ring context from in position  
versus the forb bet we're calling more or less 
the same range with some very slight tweaks to  
our approach based on the slightly different price 
we're getting which is a product of me needing to  
manufacture a heads up in position spot for us you 
can see that our 5 bet Jam range is basically the  
same though which is highlighting the fact that 
when it comes to heads up Allin ranges position  
isn't really relevant because we're not going to 
make any post flop decisions after we're already  
all in to look at things by the Numbers we can 
see on the left here the two strategies versus  
the initial open we're going much wider from in 
position as you can see 48.6% compared to 28.7  
with our three bet frequency and we're folding a 
lot less often from in position which of course is  
very natural on the right we have our strategies 
versus the forb itself since we're three betting a  
lot wider to begin with we're going to be folding 
a lot more often in relative terms and you can see  
that that we're 3 Bet folding around 550 combos 
instead of only 280 combos note however that our  
5 bet Jam range is almost exactly the same in 
each case 66.0 combos compared to 66.8 one once  
again this is because Steve's strategy is fixed 
he's calling off with the same hands and four  
betting with the same hands so we're five bet 
jamming the same hands our calling range does  
shift slightly but it's not easy to establish 
exactly why we would be calling less often from  
in position most likely caused by the slightly 
different prices on offer in the game tree that  
I had to construct to mimic an inos spot our next 
area of Investigation is to think about what we  
might do if the effective Stacks in play are much 
shallower for example at 50 big blinds instead  
of 200 big blinds at this depth it's a lot more 
difficult for us to use a larger three bet size  
since we're much closer to Simply being forced all 
in and it might not be feasible to three bet a big  
chunk of our stack we're also now at a depth where 
Steve's four bets will always be all in we're not  
going to have to think about a five bet jamming 
range here this might affect our strategy in some  
interesting ways Steve's approach is also going to 
change slightly we think he would now be willing  
to forb bet jam with 20% of hands instead of 10 
giving that he's risking fewer chips and we think  
his range for calling an Allin would be more or 
less the same set of hands he's figured out what  
range he's willing to play for Stacks with and 
he's determined to play for Stacks with those  
hands this is what our GTO strategy looks like 
against his any two cards three big blinds open  
at 50 big blinds again in a heads up context and 
this this time with a 12 big blind three bet size  
so four times the open we're doing a surprising 
amount of jamming with low pairs offsuit Aces  
and even some middling suited hands in fact this 
range looks a lot like a range for jamming 25 to  
30 big blinds over a button open in an MTT which 
is not a coincidence this spot is actually very  
similar to that one if you look at the amount that 
we're risking relative to the pop our non Allin 3  
Bet range is very polar with a fairly wide value 
region and a mostly offsuit high card low card  
Bluff region against this four bet Jam we're 
calling off as wide as Jack n suited 65 suited  
King jack off suit and we're obviously folding 
all of our three bet Bluffs if we engineer the  
same spot from in position everything looks very 
similar except for the fact that our value three  
bet region is narrower and we're no longer jamming 
anything since calling has so much more value when  
we're in position post flop our three bet call 
off region is not quite as wide since we're now  
preferring to call and realize equity in position 
with many hands which were previously preferred  
to just get it in Pre flop these are the numbers 
we're obviously folding much less often if we're  
in position although that's partially a product 
of the game tree parameters we had to use as I  
mentioned our call-off range versus the jam 
is staying relatively consistent although  
it is reducing by about 30 combos again for the 
reasons we've already stated if we apply what we  
already know about Steve's overall pre flop 
game to the shallowest stack size these are  
the strategies we end up with a very aggressive 
outer position approach which contains a lot of  
jams and a very wide three bet call off range to 
counter the fact that Steve is four bet jamming  
20% of hands we actually have very few three 
bet folds here as you can see on the right and  
only a few of those are taking that line at 
full frequency from in position the fact that  
Steve's pre- flop range is any two cards gives 
us a relatively straightforward response we're  
almost never jamming anything except for pocket 
threes about half the time and we're calling most  
of the deck with very rarely three bet folding 
and our three bet for Value range is very wide  
since we're extracting so much thin value from 
all the time Steve Rays calls the three bet in  
terms of the numbers it's much the same as what 
you'd expect much more calling from in position  
with no jamming and less three betting while the 
only reason our three bet call off range goes from  
around 280 combos from out of position to roughly 
230 from in position is because certain hands are  
no longer three betting they prefer to call and 
play in position as we saw before hands like  
pocket fors Queen n suited and King 10 off a three 
betting pre flop with the intent to call off when  
they're out of position but when in position they 
have a big incentive to just call and keep all of  
Steve's worst hands in his range so to summarize 
our overall pre flop approach against Steve in  
a way which would be applicable even in a full 
ring environment we know for sure that we have a  
significant incentive to three bet much larger 
and much more linearly for thin value if he's  
not going to be folding much that's our primary 
adjustment when we're very deep stacked there are  
many hands which like to three bet pre- flop from 
in position as part of our wider linear range but  
then simply fold if we get for bet if Steve's four 
bet remains relatively static and he's playing a  
fixed strategy where he doesn't adapt to our 
frequencies then we can do the same and simply  
three bet for thin value against his calls while 
folding a bit more against his forb bets however  
if he forb bets a very high frequency we may start 
to Simply five bet Jam a lot more as we saw before  
once we get a little shallower we're going to be 
more inclined to start jamming pre flop from out  
of position since we aren't going to be able to 
realize Equity very easily from out of position  
even when his opening range is extremely 
wide the hands which are at the top of our  
potential flatting range against this open will 
actually start to prefer to three bet call off  
instead of just calling and having to play out of 
position against a very wide range which can check  
back a lot of flops and realize some Equity from 
in position we're going to be a lot more content  
to call at shallower Stacks while still continuing 
to three bet fairly wide and linearly being very  
willing to call it off if we get jammed on 
since Steve's four bet jamming range will be  
wider finally if we were playing short stacked 
against Steve for example in an MTT scenario we  
would be shoving a lot more often both from out 
of position and in position however it's a little  
more difficult to estimate exactly how wide our 
ranges would get since ICM would most likely be  
a factor at various stages of the tournament and 
we would have to balance our desire to exploit  
Steve specifically against our priorities in the 
overall event that we're playing so now that we've  
taken a thorough look at how we might adjust 
the Steve pre flop let's see what kinds of post  
flop adjustments we might consider making first 
let's consider a somewhat deep stacked three bet  
pot scenario where we three bet a linear range 
from the blinds against a middle position open  
from Steve and he calls so here is our setup on 
GTO wizard AI if we want to look at the setup  
briefly I've got a situation with about 100 big 
blind effective Stacks Steve opens we threw that  
quite large about 5x the open size here and we get 
a flop of Queen Jack 4 I've given us a completely  
linear three bet range here as you can see just 
a lot of Broadway hands good Pairs and some good  
Aces and I've given Steve a very very wide range 
if we look at all these hands over here here it's  
a range that is basically just completely capped 
pre flop low pairs offit Aces every single suited  
hand and then maybe you know he's for betting a 
lot of these strong hands at very high frequencies  
so clearly when we get this queen Jack for flop 
we have a massive nut Advantage best hands 50.3%  
good hands 44.3 2.1 10.4 our overall Equity is 
72% roughly so it's a great spot for us here  
this is extremely favorable considering how wide 
Steve's range is and of course as a byproduct of  
that it's going to become a range bet spot for us 
solver wants to bet 100% of the time here however  
range betting would be fine here but it might not 
necessarily be the highest EV option for us if we  
look at what happens after we check Steve's range 
is so weak that he is actually only supposed to  
bet about 5% of the time but that's not happening 
we've already established that Steve is likely  
going to bet every single hand when we check to 
him so what we can do is we can actually delete  
the checking option from his side of the tree 
which I think is always kind of an interesting  
thing to do and say okay well what happens if 
we force him to bet we're not necessarily going  
to decide on his size for him we're just going 
to give him let's say four different bet sizing  
options plus an Allin and to give him the option 
to just jam and we're not going to say what size  
he has to bet we're just going to tell him you 
cannot check he does not have the option to check  
anymore and as you can see there's kind of a split 
between all in with certain hands mostly I think  
flush draws and straight draws and then basically 
betting 50% half PO with the rest of the range and  
as a result our frequency for betting on the Flop 
here has gone all the way down to zero so we've  
gone from range bet to range check and that's 
simply a byproduct of a baseline understanding  
of the fact that Steve is making so many errors 
when we check the Flop the EV of us checking  
the Flop has gone astronomically up and we are 
massively benefiting now from just allowing him  
to make that significant mistake on top of that 
not only are we now checking our entire range but  
if he bets this half pot size of 18 we are now 
literally check jamming our entire range here  
if we look at what the EVS are of some of these 
hands even check jamming a hand like Ace eight of  
spades here which has such little Equity doesn't 
really have any way to improve very easily here  
we're going to have so much fold Equity here that 
we're actually making about 35 to 40% of the pot  
here maybe even more than that depending on which 
exact combo we have uh by check jamming ace8 here  
so it's just a byproduct of him putting in so much 
money with so many trashy hands here it's actually  
very easy and plausible for us to just check Jam 
every single hand now we haven't locked what he's  
calling off with and maybe we should because 
this solver is going to want him to fold a lot  
of hands here because he's not going to be getting 
a good price but let's say he Bets with any pair  
and let's say he's never going to fold any pair 
or Draw so we've tweaked the game tree here just  
to make it easy for us to check and then him to 
range bet and against the check Jam we're going  
to have him call with any pair and any basically 
any let's say eight out straight draw or better  
so we're just going to put all of that on zero and 
then I'm going to go through the categor sets two  
pairs top pairs second pairs third pairs low pairs 
combo draws flush draws and open Enders and that's  
going to be the range of hands that he's going to 
call off with so we're going to hit lock all force  
him to play this way with everything and let's 
see if our strategy changes at all here we are  
now nope we're still check jamming everything and 
we're not going back to the Flop and deciding to  
bet everything again either we're not going to 
shift our strategy around really there EV wise  
we're losing a tiny bit well actually we we're 
losing a fair amount compared to before when he  
never folds any of these draws and never folds 
a pair uh with you know hands like Ace 8 we're  
now only making about 20% of the pot 22% of the 
pot but we're now absolutely just printing to a  
ridiculous degree even with hands like King Jack 
King Jack of Spades here just wins almost 90% of  
the pot or 80 86% of the pot so absolutely massive 
massive profit margins with these hands so just  
getting it in on the earlier streats with a higher 
Equity range than he has is really helping us here  
massive spot for us very interesting spot but a 
good guideline to even if a spot is a range bet in  
theory the mistakes he's making from in position 
make it such that we probably don't want to do  
that to summarize the spot we just looked at it 
was a spot where we could easily range bet if we  
wanted given how much Equity we had however that 
doesn't fully capture all the EV available to us  
after all we know that Steve never checks back 
to flop if we check to him and he always bets  
at least half pot so it benefits us a lot to let 
him do that this adjustment causes us to want to  
range check the Flop and based on Steve's overall 
Tendencies facing a potential check Jam from our  
range here at this low spr our best approach 
is actually to check Jam our entire range it  
seems like a bit of a crazy adjustment here but if 
your opponent really does bet the Flop with every  
single hand in their range here and their range 
is that wide then this is the best adjustment to  
make especially when their range is as wide wider 
Steves our next spot is going to be an in-position  
single Ray pot where we open pre flop and Steve 
defends the big blind we'll be a little shallower  
here at around 50 big blinds so this might be 
very applicable to a lot of MTT spots so this  
is the spot we're looking at 50 big blinds MTT 
spot I have given Steve a very very wide range  
where he is three betting that top 20 25 perish 
and then just never folding any other hand so  
he's he's literally ever folding to our raay pre 
flop clearly on this 109 for two Spades board we  
have a massive n Advantage now which of course 
is really favorable for us and it's resulted  
in a strategy where if I give us three bet size 
options here just to see if there's any kind of  
mixed strategy going on we basically are favoring 
a catchall size of 75% and there is a tiny bit of  
200% here but we're not really going to need 
to use that very much now of course we haven't  
made any assumptions yet about Steve's strategy 
so let's now take the node locking function and  
double his check raising frequency in every spot 
we're just going to instead of 14 we're going to  
put 28 versus the small bet here so we're going to 
lock everything there and then we're going to look  
at the frequency Against The Catch All Size the 
75% size and we're going to take that frequency  
and lock it at 18% instead of 9% so once again he 
is check raising twice as much as he should and  
then we're going to take this 200% size which of 
course is a huge overb bet and instead of having  
him get it in with 13% frequency we're going to 
have him get it in 26% of the time let's see what  
that does to our overall strategy and bear in mind 
we haven't tweaked his ranges very specifically  
here we haven't tweaked his continuance through 
a call all we've done is just accounted for the  
fact that he's raising a lot more let's take a 
look now things have changed quite dramatically  
we're getting to a point where with our value 
region we are betting big we are shoveling money  
in our value region of this portion of hands 
our strongest combo drawers the the Broadway  
Spades over pairs any strong 10 nines fours all 
of that stuff wants to shovel money into this pot  
by contrast a lot of other hands want to get a bit 
of money in there because they have pretty decent  
equity and maybe they want to call a raise maybe 
they want to three bet versus arays but they're  
not necessarily looking to just immediately shovel 
that money in also noteworthy that 109 is in there  
which is kind of interesting it could be a blocker 
Factor that's creating that possibly but the other  
interesting thing is the 75% size has disappeared 
now because it's not necessarily favoring the top  
of our range it's not necessarily favoring the 
bottom of our range top of our range just wants  
to bet really big everything else wants to either 
bet small or as you can see now check there's  
about 38% check frequency here which is quite 
high and it is putting us in a spot where a lot  
of of these 9x hands are going to want to check 
back the Flop a lot of Ace highs a lot of pocket  
pairs so quite obviously there are quite a lot of 
hands now which are benefiting from the fact that  
we now have the option to check behind in position 
instead of facing a check raise twice as often as  
we're supposed to so against a player like Steve 
who is a complete Maniac check raising way too  
often in position we really benefit from Simply 
checking back and realizing Equity here as opposed  
to Growing the pot and having to decide what to do 
against the check race of course the flip side of  
that is when we actually have value we want to get 
money in when we have high Equity draws we want to  
get big money in and of course Steve is playing a 
fixed strategy he's not going to exploit us he's  
not going to adapt to us so we're just looking 
to get him to shov all in and create the biggest  
pot that we possibly can so we saw here that the 
Flop is a range bet at equilibrium considering the  
very wide range that Steve is defending here but 
Steve's overall tendency to check raise too often  
increases the value of checking back for us now 
while we can't account for Steve potentially  
over bluffing the turn after we check we can 
make some broad assumptions that most of our  
middle strength hands are going to realize Equity 
more effectively after checking back than after  
betting and calling arrays from Steve however it's 
not easy to establish exactly where our threshold  
should be here since depending on the exact flop 
bet and raise sizings we use for our game tree the  
ideal response from Steve is going to shift around 
and the extent to which certain hands increase or  
decrease in EV as a bet will also change in 
order to make this spot a little simpler and  
make sure we capture the most EV possible we can 
start by focusing on the top of our range since  
that's where the majority of our EV comes from in 
any given spot in this case our strongest hands  
wanted to shovel as much money in as possible 
and take advantage of Steve's overall level of  
aggression the hands which do prioritize checking 
back or betting smaller will be the ones which  
really don't want to get raised or create bigger 
parts and that's going to be a lot of middling and  
weaker hands and again if Steve is playing a fixed 
strategy he's not adapting to us we're not going  
to get exploited for that lastly now let's look 
at a spot when we're defending against Steve's  
open and this time we're going to be the one out 
of position at the same 50 big blind stack size  
so this is our last spot in this case we've got 
a 654 rainbow flop and as you can see I've given  
very wide range or very wide range to Steve I've 
given him any two cards and our range is a little  
bit wider than what you might expect against the 
3x open here but I've kind of tried to hedge a  
little bit between a tighter range because of 
the larger open versus also a range that looks  
a little bit more like a traditional defending 
range except we are three betting a very linear  
range against Steve here so I've taken out a lot 
of the strongest hands now this would be a spot  
that would create some leading at equilibrium 
and when I ran this completely unlocked we did  
see about 40% donk Bing here from the big blind 
but I've forced big blind to check and I've also  
forced button to C bet any two cards with 50% 
size so we can tell that you know Steve is still  
range betting he's still doing exactly what he did 
before in response I've given us two check raise  
sizes and what's really interesting is that we 
do use both of them quite a lot we actually have  
a very very split response here but in particular 
there's something noteworthy about the difference  
between the two sizes if we hone in on the Allin 
size we can see that it's a lot of top pair it's  
a lot of pair plus gutshot it's a lot of pair 
Plus open Ender and if we hone in on the smaller  
Ray size the non Allin Ray size you can see that 
sets 87 and maybe some some gut shots some weaker  
Bluffs some Straits like the dece 3 those hands 
are populating this range a little bit more if we  
look at the breakdown to see the Manhattan graph 
you can kind of see this a little bit better you  
can see to some degree up here that the very very 
top of the range is populated a little bit more  
if I just highlight it here with populated a 
little bit more with the very very strongest  
stuff and the bulk of the stuff just below that 
is vulnerable enough that it doesn't really want  
to play more streets but it also does have enough 
equity to check Jam then you've got chunks like  
this over here you've got this chunk over here and 
you've got little bits and pieces of some pretty  
weak hands actually down here but in general you 
can kind of see that there's two very distinct  
raay sizes emerging here as part of our strategy 
and if we lock in what we think Steve is going to  
do against each of these sizes hopefully we will 
see it become an even more pronounced difference  
between the two approaches so if we lock in by 
saying well Steve is never folding let's say top  
pair plus maybe we don't really know what he'll 
do with second pair so we'll keep that open we'll  
also say we know he's never folding an open Ender 
but beyond that uh we're just going to kind of let  
him make his own decisions at this point we're 
not going to lock every single hand but we are  
going to lock a lot of them and then when it comes 
to the more moderate check rise size we're going  
to Lo his response there by saying we think that 
he's going to raise all in with let's say all of  
his top pair plus and all of his open Enders same 
sort of a thing and then from that point onwards  
we're going to once again keep things unlocked 
and we're not going to necessarily force him to  
play a certain way we're just going to say we 
have a pretty decent idea that he's going to  
be willing to get it in very wide and let's see 
what strategy looks like as a byproduct so we're  
now going to lock Steve's response against the 
more moderate raise size and in this case what  
we're going to do is assume that he gets it in 
with a lot of hands of course gets it in with  
his top pair plus and all of that stuff and then 
we're also going to assume that he has a certain  
region where he responds very passively third 
pair second pair low pair he's just going to call  
Gut shots he's going to call and so on so that I 
think is going to alter our response a little bit  
just put the ray back in there in the overpair 
and top pair categories so now we've got this  
response where he's actually being quite passive 
uh in a lot of ways and if I just put all of this  
stuff over here on fold because the Sim does want 
him to actually call at least a little bit with  
some of these back door hands we now have all of 
his range locked in and if we have two different  
responses against these two different sizes for 
him here let's see how our range is distributed we  
actually prefer the small size so this is what's 
really interesting here that in theory originally  
we now came to a point of we really wanted to 
just check Jam but because he's making a lot  
of passive mistakes against the non Allin size 
here we actually benefit from that and when he  
does Jam against this size we now just basically 
call it off with every single hand so we're never  
folding to the jam if he does Jam but because the 
smaller size generates additional calls from him  
that shouldn't call so he's calling with any 
Deuce any gutshot he's calling with any four  
he's never folding a pair here because we're now 
getting additional value out of that it's going to  
incentivize us to use this size we don't want to 
necessarily stop him from making those mistakes by  
being passive here we could still Jam the jam is 
still going to have value attached to it and you  
we haven't locked his range in full here so maybe 
if we had him never folding a pair he uh he we  
might be able to gain more value from the Allin 
but this is greater than a 2X pot all in and we  
did say before he never folds a pair to less than 
2x pot but above 2x pot we don't really know so  
in general here even if we kind of attribute some 
frequency to calling off with bottom pair here the  
Allin is not as valuable as the small raise the 
67% raise here so we're definitely prioritizing  
that as one of our main tools to exploit Steve and 
his overall passiveness against that raise size  
so in this spot we saw that there were some flop 
donk bets existing at equilibrium against Steve's  
wide opening range however if Steve is always 
SE betting this board we should check and let  
him make this mistake our check raise frequency if 
Steve range bets half pot is extremely high mostly  
because our calls are going to under realize 
their equity on a highly Dynamic board texture  
and a lot of our potential check raising hands 
are simply going to shov all in if they get three  
bet or call off against the three bet shove 
if we're a little bit shallower a little bit  
deeper there's going to be some slight variations 
there one downside of check raising a lot here  
and taking advantage of Steve's continues is that 
since the board is highly Dynamic it's definitely  
going to be pretty tricky to play the turn here 
after we check raise and we could consider using  
that larger check raise or the check Jam as a 
counter to this but of course there is going to  
be a little bit of an EV sacrifice that comes 
along with forcing ourselves to check Jam some  
hands which might do better as a smaller raise to 
get value from that passiveness of Steve's so this  
may not be an optimal approach it might just be 
a practical simplification and of course if you  
are looking at getting better at these spots I 
would recommend practicing them run them through  
GTO wizard AI run some node locks put some trainer 
drills together and give yourself a chance to get  
better at playing these spots so this brings us 
back around to establishing an overall strategic  
framework for how we're going to crush Steve even 
in a full ring environment against a maniac like  
Steve the bulk of R comes from the earlier streets 
and from the fact that he's putting in far too  
much money with far too many hands our goal is 
to build pots with higher Equity hands even if  
those are some fairly thin value hands and extract 
the maximum value at the top of our range this is  
going to mean we use larger sizes and more linear 
ranges overall to maximize the amount of money we  
can get into the pot on the earlier streets 
while our Equity is still high our goal here  
is to realize our own Equity as much as possible 
being all in pre- flop or on the Flop if necessary  
while denying Steve the chance to realize his 
Equity since a big part of the reason why his  
Maniac style is a losing strategy is because most 
of the hands he plays aren't strong enough to  
realize enough equity against our range if we play 
too passively against Steve and don't get enough  
money into the pot on the earlier streets then 
we allow him to realize his Equity more easily  
we end up with more spots where he unexpectedly 
sucks out on the turno river or more spots where  
we simply can't get any value from a very good 
hand because he lands on the river with nothing  
which can pay us off the exception here is when 
our hands Equity is highly robust for example  
if we flop a full house or another hand which is 
virtually Invincible in those instances we might  
benefit from allowing Steve's extremely weak 
range to realize some more equity and pick up  
a hand which can pay us off to some extent finally 
when it comes to post flop play if Steve is always  
going to bet when we check to him we should not 
bet from out of position check raising should  
be a huge part of our strategy against him when 
we're in position we may want to have more check  
in order to neutralize his ability to check Rays 
at a higher frequency but from out of position  
our main source of EV is to allow him to put 
far too much money into the pot with too many  
hands that about does it for this video thanks for
