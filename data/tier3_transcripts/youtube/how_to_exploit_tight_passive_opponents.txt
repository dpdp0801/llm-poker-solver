### TOPIC: how to exploit tight passive opponents
have you ever had trouble winning hands 
against the tightest player in your game  
the one who always seems to have it every 
time they're in a pot who never seems to  
Bluff but who manages to win anyway if you're 
having difficulty beating the nits this video  
is for you nit is a term that has been around 
in poker for a number of years and seems to  
have stood the test of time even as 
other poker terminology has changed  
significantly I'm Matt hunt and today we're 
going to be discussing how to beat the nits
[Music]
to me it comes down to four primary 
characteristics the first thing is that the player  
is highly risk averse they don't like to gamble 
and they're looking to get their money in with the  
best hand whenever possible we've all encountered 
players like this they probably even take level of  
pride in never taking the worst of it when they're 
all in the second characteristic we'll often  
observe is that they'll be overfolded most nodes 
of the game tree simply due to their unwillingness  
to invest chips in the pot without confidence 
that they have the best hand the only exception  
to this will be in situations where they already 
massively overfolded one node of the game Tree on  
a certain Street meaning their range on the next 
street might contain exclusively very strong hands  
which aren't likely to fold in addition to this 
their overall aggression frequencies are likely  
to be very low they'll do a lot of checking when 
they should be be betting and very little raising  
needless to say when they do take aggressive lines 
they're extremely unlikely to be bluffing in fact  
many of them will adopt a strategy of essentially 
never bluffing this means all of their aggressive  
ranges will be very value heavy and their pre- 
flop ranges will of course be tighter than average  
in virtually every spot all of these factors will 
combine to create the type of table image that is  
usually relatively quickly identifiable as your 
classic knit profile with this in mind I want  
you all to meet our opponent for this video 
the embodiment of the NIT archetype his name  
is Joe and he's an 85-year-old recreational poker 
player from the USA Joe's defining characteristic  
is that he does not like to gamble he enjoys 
poker as a game but he's not interested in the  
big pots or big action much in fact that he only 
three bets pre- flop with pocket aces even kings  
are a calling hand for Joe he will call hands pre- 
flop but mostly with hands in the top 10 to 15% of  
the deck his overall vpip is going to be very low 
he never check raises Bluffs in any way after all  
when Joe first started playing poker in the late 
1950s check raising wasn't even allowed in most  
games finally Joe's other defining characteristic 
is that he will only raise when he has the nuts on  
the river he won't even raise with the nuts on the 
Flop or turn because there's still a possibility  
he could lose the hand on the river obviously he's 
leaving a lot of money on the table by doing this  
but Joe's not there for the money he doesn't mind 
now many players who encounter Joe in tournaments  
or who play against him in cash games have a 
variety of complaints about playing with him  
you'll frequently hear variations of the following 
quotes Joe just always has it if Joe gets to the  
river he already has a strong hand he's probably 
not going to fold you can't get value from Joe  
because he never pays you off or when Joe raises 
you should just fold everything there are elements  
of Truth in all of these statements particularly 
the last one but they reveal a lot of common  
misconceptions with regard to how we actually 
make money from playing against typ players  
which we'll explore in a second but first let's 
take a macro level view of how we actually make  
money against players like Joe because we can all 
readily identify that these players aren't playing  
well but it can be hard to figure out exactly 
where our money is coming from let's take a  
look at a few obvious ways in which we make money 
from Joe before we look at the less obvious ways  
first one fairly trivial aspect of playing against 
Joe is that he gives us very little incentive to  
invest chips in a pot once he's already in there 
his ranges are all very tight which reduces the  
equity of all our hands and he doesn't Bluff at 
all we have very limited incentive to Bluff catch  
or call down in other words spots in which we 
would usually be forced to continue with middle  
strength hands in order to avoid over folding now 
become very comfortable folds and Joe never Bluffs  
us off of a good hand obviously this helps us to 
make money secondly Joe folds too much pre flop  
when facing a raise which means our open raises 
are going to print a lot more money than they  
usually would especially when he's on the button 
or in the big blind since those are spots where  
players would usually be fighting back against 
our opens relatively aggressively we're going to  
take down a lot more pots pre flop against Joe 
and generally face less pre- flop resistance  
finally we're never going to get denied our Equity 
when we're in position we're always going to have  
the option to either bet and face a call or fold 
or simply check and see the next street this is  
because Joe never check raises and he only raises 
with the nuts on the river meaning the only time  
we ever end up folding to a raise from Joe is when 
we have no equity anyway because he has the nuts  
this means our overall post flop Equity 
realization will almost always be fairly High  
since even though we're up against a tighter range 
than we usually would be we're going to see all  
three streets a lot more often as well and we will 
still have the opportunity to win the occasional  
pot without Showdown when the board runs out 
unfavorably for Joe's range however one of the  
key ways in which we make money against Joe is not 
obvious at all in fact it's an example of what I  
refer to as invisible EV in other words it's EV 
that we gain from that's not happening as opposed  
to that is and we don't even have to change our 
strategy at all in order to benefit from it here's  
what I mean I ran an experiment to Showcase this 
phenomenon where I used a pre-f flop to set up a  
four-handed 30 big blind scenario with a big blind 
anti to replicate a tournament spot in this spot  
we're going to imagine that we're on the button 
and Joe is in the cut off and we're just playing  
pure chipe in this spot to keep it simpler the two 
scenarios I tested here were a basic GTO scenario  
with standard Ray sizings and no locked ranges 
and then a scenario where Joe is in the cut off  
and he's only open raising with 10% of hands as 
you can see dropping the opening range of the cuto  
off from almost 37% to only 10% massively reduces 
the cut offs win rate from 35.8 big blinds per 100  
to only 19.3 big blinds per 100 interestingly 
though even though Joe is opening much tighter  
than he's supposed to he's still capturing more 
than half of his expected win rate here however  
the real magic takes place when we look at at our 
own strategy and win rate on the button here in  
the third column you can see that our overall 
vpip once Joe opens is much tighter than it  
is versus a GTO opponent we're only putting money 
in the pot about 17% of the time compared to more  
than 27% this is because Joe is openings tightly 
obviously and you can see that our win rate after  
Joe opens is significantly reduced as well we're 
only winning around 15 big blinds per 100 once Joe  
opens the pot instead of almost 35 big blinds per 
100 against the GTO opponent so if we're forced  
to play tighter once Joe opens and we're making 
less money once he opens shouldn't that mean we're  
making less money overall well in fact it doesn't 
because as you can see in the fifth column our  
overall win rate in this four-handed scenario 
actually jumps from 44.6 big blinds per 100 to  
46.4 big blinds per 100 how is this possible the 
answer lies in what happens after Joe doesn't open  
even though we're forced to play titter versus 
his opens and we're not making as much money  
against his opens as we previously were he's now 
open folding the cut off 90% of the time instead  
of only around 63% this means we get a lot more 
opportunities to open the button once he folds  
which is a very profitable situation for us if 
it's not clear how this works imagine we have a  
hand like Jack n off suit on the button and Joe is 
dealt a hand like King 5 suited Joe is supposed to  
open raise this hand and force us to fold our Jack 
n and lose the hand but when he elects to fold  
instead we now have the Unity to profitably open 
Jack n off on the button and play the pot against  
the blinds all the occasions where this happens 
add up quite significantly meaning that even  
though we're forced to play much tighter against 
Joe's opens and we make less money in those spots  
we're compensated by having more opportunities 
to play in position versus the blinds which is  
a high EV spot for us even if the blinds are still 
playing GTO this is a big part of how making money  
from type players Works some of our EV simply 
comes from the fact that we are getting a greater  
number of later position open Raise opportunities 
when they're folding hands that they should be  
raising we can see even further evidence of this 
from the fact that the small blind and big blind  
win rates are both a lot higher as well all 
three players are making more money from Joe  
folding the cut off March even though they are 
forced to fold a lot more often once he actually  
does open let's now look at a similar situation 
except where Joe is in the big blind I've run a  
three-handed 50 big blinds big blind anti scenario 
to illustrate this one in this spot we can expect  
Joe to defend a lot tighter than the nearly 
80% frequency he's supposed to call from the  
big blind against the Min rays in fact because 
this hand is only three-handed with no players  
acting before the button the lack of bunching 
effect means the big blind is supposed to almost  
never fold versus an open in addition to knowing 
that Joe defends his big blind a lot tighter in  
this case we've gone with around 27% of hands 
we'll know that Joe only three bets with pocket  
aces which makes our response to a three bet 
fairly simple we won't worry about that for now  
another crucial element is the fact that we can 
expect Joe to significantly overfall to a small  
cab bet on the Flop we've been able to account 
for that in our calculations as well assigning  
him a roughly 20% overfall as well as a 0% check 
raise frequency as you can see all these factors  
take our button opening range from 56% all 
the way up to any two cards and our overall  
win rate on the button has skyrocketed from 
53.4 big blinds per 100 up to a massive 98.8  
big blinds per 100 we're winning almost one big 
blind per hand obviously this is another way in  
which we massively profit from Joe's mistakes 
we can freely open any two cards on his big  
blind from the button and substantially wider in 
other positions as well between his tendency to
overfolded to players a lot of the money you make 
comes from spots that you don't see as opposed to  
the ones you do you don't get to see when your 
opponent makes an incredibly tight fold but you  
make money every single time it happens now that 
we've established how we're going to adapt our  
opening ranges to Joe's tightness in the big 
blind let's a look at how we might adapt on  
the rare occasions where Joe is the one opening 
there's actually a fairly simple hack I like to  
use when defending against players who are tighter 
than usual we just scale back our response to what  
it would be if they opened one two or even three 
position earlier for a scenario where a knit opens  
the button we treat it like a high Jack or a 
low Jack open when they open the low Jack we  
might treat it like they're opening under the 
gun but what do we do when they open under the  
gun after all in this spot it's very possible 
Joe might be even tighter with his opens than  
a normal n-h handed under the gun range which is 
very tight to begin with in this graphic you can  
see the results of another experiment I ran where 
we're defending the big blind at 50 big blinds  
effective versus A Min raise open from Joe with a 
big blind anti in play positions aren't relevant  
here only the actual range that Joe is opening and 
the game tree is the same in all examples you can  
see that the first three columns look relatively 
standard as big blind defense spots go but since  
15% is pretty close to being the tightest opening 
range we'll see in a GTO scenario with a big blind  
anti in play the next two columns are where it 
gets very interesting if Joe is only opening 10%  
of hands a folding frequency shoots all the way 
up to almost 50% and if he's tight enough to only  
open the top five 5% it tops 65% interestingly if 
he's opening exactly Aces and Aces only we get to  
fold slightly less often but that's understandable 
considering that post flop play gets a lot easier  
when we know our opponent's exact hand as you can 
tell our response to Joe's opens is going to look  
significantly tighter than GTO and it would be 
a pretty big mistake for us to continue calling  
with the GTO big blind defense range if Joe is 
opening extremely tightly we can't account for  
all the mistakes Joe might make post flop but it's 
ult for him to play a very strong range of hands  
badly that it offsets how strong his range is to 
begin with now the next part of our process is  
to begin figuring out what we're actually going 
to do Post flop on the occasions where Joe does  
defend against our open the major problem we 
have to deal with here is that Joe's calling  
range is extremely condensed to the point where 
it's going to be very strong and uncapped on a  
large number of flops when you combine this with 
the fact that we're opening wide to capitalize on  
his tight defending it's going to compound and 
create a scenario where we're at a big equity  
disadvantage on a lot of boards however one 
potential Lifesaver for us is that while Joe  
is supposed to do a lot of Don betting on account 
of his overall Equity Advantage it's unlikely he  
actually will meaning that there will be plenty 
of boards where if he plays a pure check strategy  
and has no donk bets we actually should play a 
pure check strategy as well and simply never bet  
any hand when checked to the only thing that might 
allow us to start betting these boards is the fact  
that Joe is never check raising us it means we can 
be very confident of realizing a good portion of  
our equity on future streets obviously our Equity 
isn't very good though we have to be cautious in  
evaluating how much of a benefit this really is 
let's establish what Joe's potential pre- flop  
defending range might look like you can see it 
here on the left without any two button opening  
range on the right we have Joe defending all pairs 
up to Kings all Broadways suited gappers since Joe  
likes to flop streets and flushes and a few other 
stronger suited hands it's about 27% of hands  
overall and it's much much tighter than an optimal 
big blind defense range with a big blind anti in  
play it actually looks a lot more like a high 
rake cash game defending range perhaps against  
a larger open size I used this pair of ranges to 
run a variety of different flops on GTO wizard AI  
at 50 big blind stack sizes here you can see the 
results measured in terms of our overall betting  
volume which if you're not familiar is simply 
our sizing multiplied by our frequency it's a  
good measurement of how aggressively we play a 
spot overall I compared our approach against the  
GTO opponent with a GTO opening range to what we 
would do against Joe without any two range you can  
see that the first five boards on our list of 10 
all the ones which have any Broadway card on them  
have virtually no betting from us at all with the 
slight exception of the queen 96 rainbow however  
the boards which are nine high or lower have 
us putting in a lot more volume especially the  
paired boards the 996 rainbow and 733 rainbow why 
is this happening well you might be able to guess  
it's because these are the few boards on which 
Joe actually can't have very many strong hands  
at all if he's not defending any offsuit 9x hands 
pre flop or very many suited 3x hands at all then  
it makes sense that he would very rarely have 
strong hands on those boards with the exception  
of pocket pairs that flop full houses his range 
is going to include very few hands with trips or  
better while ours includes the entire deck which 
obviously means we can have every possible combo  
of trips plus the loward straight boards have the 
same effect he's not flopping a lot of Straits or  
two pairs on these boards but we have all of The 
Straits and two pairs even the offsuit ones and  
both players can have all the sets this means our 
usual approach of attacking higher boards against  
the big blind and playing cautiously on Lower 
boards is completely reversed we're essentially  
range checking the higher boards against Joe 
and attacking the lower ones where we know it's  
very difficult for him to have better than one 
pair these Concepts can be tricky to internalize  
let's take a look at a few node locked examples 
that I've prepared first two examples of our  
cat strategy from in position versus Joe and 
then one where we've defended the big blind  
and we're trying to fight back against Joe's very 
tight and strong seab betting range first we're  
going to look at this Ace King 7 rainbow board in 
the button versus big blind formation at 50 big  
blinds as you can see here with the original Sim 
using GTO ranges this is a board where in position  
as the button is going to be able to basically 
range bet for a small size if we were using a  
large sizing here we would obviously have checks 
and these Ace King X boards can be fine for large  
sizes as well but in a fairly simple way a GTO 
strategy here where we just range bet is going  
to be quite effective now you'll notice that 
there's no donk betting from the big blind this  
is a very favorable Ward for in position even on 
the button as you can see in position has a huge  
nut Advantage here and big blind really doesn't 
have any to do any dong Bing now if I switch to  
using a version of The Sim where we are employing 
the ranges that I gave Joe and ourselves our any  
two cards button opening range and Joe's big 
blind defending range you can see it actually  
completely flips this spot around and it becomes 
a range donk bet for Joe and it's not relevant  
to look at what happens once Joe checks because 
that check is never happening the check is a 0%  
frequency the fact that our strategy looks really 
weird and randomized here is not really we have to  
actually pay attention to but of course it's 
probably relatively likely that Joe does not  
have this 25 5% donk bet in his range if we remove 
this option then it should give us a better sense  
of what our actual strategy should look like 
and what you'll what you'll find is that if  
Joe does check his entire range it now becomes a 
spot where we don't bet anything we purely check  
we really are never betting anything here simply 
because look at the massive not disadvantage that  
we're at here there's very very few hands in 
our range that can actually tolerate betting  
Joe's Equity is much higher than than ours if you 
look at the equity graph across all parts of the  
range and most of our range here is just hoping to 
realize Equity it's really not a good spot for us  
Joe has 65% Equity we're just really struggling 
with this incredibly wide range here part of the  
why we're not actually betting here is because 
if we did we'd be very vulnerable against the  
check Rays if we actually nod loock ourselves to 
range bet in this case and we just hit node loock  
we hit lock all and continue then we'll get to 
see how often would be able to check raise us if  
we continued range betting in this spot and it 
might honestly be a range check raise it might  
be that if we range bet here we get punished hard 
that theoretically he can just check raise every  
single hand yeah he can he he every single hand 
in his range has enough equity to check raise here  
right clearly he's not actually doing this but it 
is entirely viable that we would consider simply  
that it would be very very difficult for us to get 
our CET through often enough that we can get away  
with just range betting here the question becomes 
how extreme does Joe's strategy have to become  
before we can start range betting again and if we 
do think that perhaps 20% is the margin by which  
he might overfolded that we could still be able to 
bet a lot or maybe just bet hands let's keep this  
25% size we're going to unlock our strategy again 
we're going to go back to a baseline approach of  
checking everything and we're then going to lock 
Joe's strategy we're going to have him first of  
all not check raise anything because we've already 
said he doesn't check raise unless he has the nuts  
on the river we're going to get rid of any check 
raise option that he might have and it's already  
warning me that this is not part of GTO but that's 
fine and then we're going to nolock this strategy  
that instead of folding almost never here he's 
going to be folding like 50 to 60% it's going  
to be a lot higher than what he should be but 
we're going to lock that in there what I like  
to do with node locking is just put everything on 
fold to begin with and then manually paint in the  
stuff that we can be very confident that he's 
not going to fold in this case I don't think we  
can realistically expect him to fold a king here 
don't think we can expect him to fold a straight  
draw don't think we can expect him to fold a 
set but beyond that I don't know he might uh  
he might make big folds he might fold a seven 
here not sure bottom pair is going to be good  
enough for Joe here let's go with that we're going 
to lock that in as his response and we're going to  
see if this very significant overfolded more here 
in fact it is we go back to range betting this is  
kind of the premise on which we employed that 
any two cards raising range pre flop that we  
ran that pre flop assuming that Joe was going to 
significantly overfolded and if that's the case  
then even on a board where he's supposed to lead 
his entire range and if we are range betting he's  
supposed to check raise everything if he doesn't 
if he plays pure call or fold and he starts  
folding a seven to a small bet we can now range 
bet everything if he doesn't fold a seven let's  
see if that affects anything here bearing in mind 
that he doesn't have a lot of hands containing a  
seven in his actual range nope nothing changes in 
the end even if he's not folding a seven here we  
actually still can quite easily range bet and if 
we look at the hands that benefit the most from  
this by using the EV tool you can see that the 
hands that are benef fitting the most in terms  
of EV between betting and checking are going to be 
all of the weaker hands in our range the very very  
bottom of our range the stuff that can't really 
realize Equity very well by checking like Queen  
five off here if we bet this we're now making 
20% of the pot compared to if we check we're  
making 15% about a third of our EV on top of 
what we're making by checking we're actually  
gaining by betting Queen five off here essentially 
Joe's tightness is going to turn a lot of boards  
that should not be range bets against a very 
tight range into range bets even when our range  
is extremely wide simply because we realize much 
Equity now the caveat here is what we have to do  
on the turn if we do range bet here if we go with 
the range bet strategy and then Joe calls we are  
going to see that our turn strategy is going to 
have to revolve around slowing down a lot let's  
say the turn is a brick the dece of clubs one of 
the biggest bricks we can imagine here obviously  
not a card that affects Joe's range very much his 
range is strong that once again he's now supposed  
to donk bed again from out of position but let's 
say he doesn't do that now once once more we're  
up against an extremely strong range we're no 
longer able to overb this turn because we just  
don't have enough nut hands and we still are very 
disincentivized from betting we have few bets here  
only the top basically sets and two pair but even 
the two pair we're still kind of worried about the  
fact that he can have a set of Kings or a set 
of sevens here right there really aren't very  
many hands that want to bet here we're bluffing 
with a lot of 9x I would imagine that has to do  
with interacting with of his most likely folds but 
you can see here that the optimal range that he's  
supposed to fold here based on the Range that he 
gets here with is going to look a bit different  
to reality he's supposed to continue with a king 
and then fold an ace that's probably realistic  
let's nolock him again let's now have him only 
continue with top pair plus he's never going to  
fold an ace but he's never going to continue with 
anything worse top pair Plus on the turn against  
this 2/3 pop bet and now we're actually betting at 
a very high rate right we're almost range betting  
the turn and this is again what happens when 
egregiously overfolded if we follow this through  
to the river another brick maybe a five let's say 
once again we're up against this very very tight  
range but even though he gets here with nothing 
that is worse than top pair he's probably still  
going to have to make relatively big call Downs in 
order to stop us from profitably bluffing even if  
we simplify to a two-thirds pot or a check on this 
River and have no allins we know that Joe doesn't  
raise without the nuts considering he can't have 
34 here he can never raise which is great and if  
we delete his raising option from the tree we see 
that immediately we're starting to be able to bet  
most of our two PA plus and then let's say he only 
calls the river with two PA or better now we're  
actually still ending up in a spot where we're 
able to go for a triple barrel with basically  
everything and we're printing here because of 
how much he's overfolded if he's not willing to  
call down with top pair really at all we're still 
going to be able to just blast off pretty happily  
against Joe's range in this spot however note that 
our two pairs and our Ace Jacks and Ace queens  
that might normally become hands that would go for 
Value here are slowing down however a hand like  
ace10 is actually bluffing here believe it or not 
because he's folding Ace Jack and Ace Queen Ace 10  
is now turning itself into a bluff it doesn't have 
enough Showdown value to justify just checking it  
can actually profitably Bluff and the same goes 
for the rest of those ASX hands this is a really  
interesting run out OB obviously it's a pretty 
blank one which gives Joe a lot of one pair hands  
but it's showing us that even when we think that 
Joe's range is really really tight for continuing  
across each Street we are still going to reach 
the river in spots where Joe can actually find  
over folds we can still Barrel off in instances 
now the second board that we're going to look at  
is this 733 rainbow that I mentioned earlier on 
now in the GTO version you can see that this is  
a board where in position is going to once again 
use a small size because it's a paired board it's  
a rainbow however it's not quite a range betting 
board because the big Blan does possess a lot of  
3x if we look at how often the big blind has trips 
here it's about 6.2% it's not a frequency that's  
going to be particularly for the inos player but 
they are going to have to take it into account  
especially since in position has trips only 2.7% 
of the time it's certainly it's going to influence  
the strategies here however if we flip this around 
and we look at the ranges that Joe is going to  
have we'll see it's going to look very different 
this is the scenario with the two ranges that  
apply when we're playing against Joe we're opening 
any2 Joe's defending with 27% you can see that Joe  
still has more best hands than we do however 
if we focus on the trips region specifically  
Joe only has trips 1.8% of the time but we have 
it 7.5% even though our range is any two cards  
the actual frequency we have trips has gone up 
and even though Joe has a lot of overpays we  
can actually put those over pairs in tough spots 
across multiple streets here in this version of  
the spot instead of actually being a board where 
we're using a small size once Joe checks again  
we're assuming no donk betting from Joe here this 
is now actually going to become a big bet board a  
slightly unexpected development perhaps but it's a 
little bit more in keeping with how paired boards  
play when we're the outer position pre- flop Razer 
and our opponent can't really flop very many trips  
you do see big bets on those boards and this is no 
different this is a spot where a lot of our trip  
wants to bet big and a lot of our other hands can 
bet big in order to apply a lot of pressure to  
those overpays across multiple streets if we now 
look at progressing through what Joe's response  
to this bet might be well we know he's not going 
to check raise because we know he has no check  
raisers let's immediately get rid of that and that 
might influence our our frequency even more we're  
at 55% now and now we can see that there's quite a 
lot of hands here that Joe is supposed to continue  
against any two cards or against our wide range 
but once again he's probably not let's see how  
far this takes us when it comes to our range let's 
say Joe is continuing with basically any one pair  
or better here and maybe we'll be generous and say 
he's continuing with any straight draw and any ace  
high with two overcards and he's now overfolded 
only by about 9% but that's enough to allow us to  
bet 91% of the time here we're almost able to 
range bet with a big size here simply because  
Joe is not check raising at all and it becomes 
very favorable for us to just realize Equity  
our remaining streets now we could possibly 
make an argument for splitting our sizes here  
and potentially going smaller with of our Bluffs 
and just going bigger for Value against Joe but  
realistically maybe that's complicating things 
a little bit too much it might be quite simple  
to just go ahead with a strategy like this check 
back a lot of our strongest Ace highs check back  
a couple of hands for deception and maybe a 
little bit of protection of our range on the  
turn but we don't really have to worry that much 
about about that here because uh Joe is not going  
to show a ton of turn aggression ultimately this 
might actually be a very viable strategy here on  
the Flop now we've kind of seen how the Dynamics 
develop here across the latest streets I don't  
think we need to go into turn and River again for 
this scenario but it does illustrate here the EV  
that we gained from Joe never check raising 
the Flop and how that's going to filter into  
our strategy allowing us to bet the Flop a lot 
more aggressively especially when it's a board  
like this where we can have those big hands that 
he can't and we're now able to use a big size on  
a board where a small size might otherwise make a 
lot more sense our last nolock spot here is going  
to be one where we're defending the big blind 
against Joe and it's going to be this king queen  
8 rainbow board now in the GTO version of this 
spot we're obviously defending quite wide even  
though Joe is opening under the gun in this case 
and it's at 50 big blinds we're still defending  
a lot of suited hands we're folding a lot more 
offit stuff and that creates a circumstance where  
this board is very good for the opening range and 
of course that's going to mean that opening range  
gets to bet quite a lot where they're betting big 
here about 80% of the time pretty high aggression  
board High betting volume from in position here 
if we look at the version of this spot where Joe  
is the opener obviously his range is going to be 
even tighter that's going to be we have to keep in  
mind but in addition to that maybe Joe isn't going 
to bet quite as big we'll see if that offsets it  
here now I do want to look at our response here 
because it's going to be interesting to see just  
how much defending we're going to have to do even 
against this 3/4 pot bet here we're folding quite  
a lot but we are raising 7.4% of the time we still 
have plenty of hands that want to raise we still  
have hands that can raise for Value we've got 
the Jack NES the 10 NES raising as a bluff rate  
there's plenty of hands here that can raise and 
we have about 41 combos total of raises which  
of course makes a lot of sense we'll keep that in 
mind as we go and look at the version here where  
Joe is opening super tight and we are defending 
quite a bit tighter as well this is going to be  
what that spot looks like as you can see I've 
tightened up our range quite a bit it's hard  
to know exactly whether this is the appropriate 
range here considering how tight Joe's range is on  
the right I would imagine that if we did run this 
through a pre flops it might allow us to fold even  
more pre flop simply because the pre-flop solver 
would be assuming that Joe plays perfect perfectly  
across all the streets in practice maybe calling 
with a range like this is going to work pretty  
well we're folding the weakest offs suit Broadways 
because they have a lot of uh reverse implied odds  
on a lot of boards but we are still three betting 
Kings plus Ace King off etc for value and we're  
not really three bet bluffing much here if we do 
it's going to come mostly from our blocker region  
we're not going to worry about that for now this 
is our range and we're going to carry it forward  
to this flop now I've assigned Joe just a half pop 
bet size here and you can see that because it's  
such a good board for him it wants him to just 
range bet that's pretty trivial that's not that we  
should be particularly surprised about however we 
don't necessarily think Joe is actually going to  
do this we will tweak this in a second but to look 
at our response you can see that it does want us  
to still have check raises in fact the check raise 
frequency goes slightly up and we're still folding  
a lot but we're raising now 8.8% and again that's 
because the BET size is now only 50% if we look at  
what Joe is supposed to do versus the check 
rise he's going to continue at a high rate but  
he's betting hands like Jax and then folding 
he's betting Ace Queen and then mixing we can  
expect him to have hands that fold however 
again in practice Joe is a huge nit let's  
nolock his range here to where he only bets for 
Value we've already said he doesn't Bluff let's  
put everything on check like I did before and we 
will say top pair or better is his value range and  
that's it he has no Bluffs he's not betting his 
Ace Jacks his Jack 10s anything like that we're  
just locking everything right there and based on 
this we are now going to see a pretty big change  
in our strategy take a look at this we're now 
folding a massive frequency and it does still  
have us raising a little bit with maybe blockers 
hands that do have implied odds on later streets  
like our Jack 10s but that's on the assumption 
that this is Joe's response and he actually folds  
Ace King and r well what if he doesn't do that 
I don't think he's ever going to Rea here but I  
don't think he's ever going to fold let's put call 
at 100% And when that happens we're now going to  
see we're actually playing check raise or fold 
which is very interesting and we're really only  
check raising with value and then hands that have 
a little bit of that implied odds possibility on  
latest streets the Jack 10 is in there presumably 
because we do get paid a lot when we make a  
straight and then a little bit of the 109 and the 
Jack n for the same little bit of the ace 10 and  
the ace Jack for the same tiny bit of the queen 
Jack I would assume that's just partially because  
of blocking power and those backo flush and 
straight outs that we have but other than that it  
is pure value eights Queens Queen eight King eight 
king queen that is it we are never calling here we  
have no to call because Joe's range is tight that 
we're not going to realize Equity through calling  
his range is only strong hands which means 
he's almost always going to be able to bet  
turns we're just not going to realize equity and 
we should just fold a ton on the Flop here we're  
not even calling top pair because he's not betting 
enough of those Jack 10s Ace Jacks Etc if we did  
add the straight draws to his range here let's see 
what effect that has it might have effect but it  
might not be that significant if he bets all of 
his open Enders and his gut shots here now this  
is a little bit more of an aggressive version of 
Joe here maybe a little bit more ambitious if he  
does bet those hands and then we still maybe would 
say he doesn't fold to the raise we go up a little  
bit with our frequencies here we're now it's kind 
of unusual that we're raising stuff like 85 as a  
bluff but this would most likely be yeah uh we we 
still have him pretty much never folding uh let's  
just actually put it at call 100 here if he calls 
every single time there's now going to be a small  
amount of value that we can get from those Jack 
10s there's going to probably be yeah there's a  
tiny bit of like there's King 10 like Queen six 
is in there it's a little surprising Queen six  
with a back door 87 85 might be implied odds when 
we turn two pair plus we have that set blocker  
but generally speaking still just never calling 
it's all just going to be a question of how much  
opportunity do we have to raise for thinner value 
or for implied odds purposes and ultimately it's  
a very very tight strategy one way or the other a 
very interesting response but quite obvious when  
you think about how how tight Joe's range actually 
is as a whole that is going to do it for this  
video thank you everybody for following with me 
as you can see Joe is making a lot of mistakes and  
there's a lot of money to be made playing against 
him if we understand how to do it if you guys have  
any further questions please feel free to reach 
out to me via Discord and ask questions there or  
leave a comment on this video and we'll try to get 
to as many of them as we can in the meantime thank  
you for watching Everybody I'll be back again 
with more videos good luck everyone [Music]
