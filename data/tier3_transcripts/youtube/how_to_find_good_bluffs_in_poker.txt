### TOPIC: how to find good bluffs in poker
Today we'll be discussing blockers.
Definitely a very tricky topic and I'm sure
many of you guys have had the experience of
staring at a sim for hours and hours trying
to figure out why the solver bluffs with JT
of hearts but not JT of spades.
And just when you think you finally figured
it out, you pulled up a slightly different
board, and now the solver is bluffing with
Spades instead.
if that sounds like you, then definitely stay
till the end because I'm going to cover two
simple concepts that will help you find the
right bluffs in any situation.
Let's talk a little bit about how NOT to think
about blockers.
So I want you guys to imagine that we're barreling
down on an ace-high board against a range
of mostly ace-x bluff-catchers.
In terms of our own range, we have AK, which
is the main hand we're batting for value.
To balance our AK we have a bunch of bluffs
like JT and 98.
A very common approach here is to try to choose
the bluffs that block our opponent's best
calls.
So in this case, a certain player might argue
that we should be bluffing with JT because
we block AJ and AT, which are the most likely
calls in villain's range.
But of course, the problem with this is that
villain's strategy is actually dynamic - meaning
if we choose to bluff with JT all the time
what villain can do to take advantage of that
is just to fold with AJ/AT and prefer calling
with A9/A8 instead since AJ/AT would now block
our main bluff.
Once he starts doing this it actually becomes
pretty bad for us to bluff JT since we no
longer block that many calls in his range.
So now we would start preferring to bluff
with 98 instead, and once again villain can
just adjust by folding A9/A8 and preferring
to call with AJ/AT, and that, in turn, would
make us want to start bluffing with JT again.
So we end up stuck in this sort of endless
cycle where we can't really identify any kind
of good bluff in our range because the fact
is there isn't any specific hand in our range
that has good properties for bluffing.
If you run this toy game in the solver, you'll
see that it wants to bluff JT and 98 at exactly
the same frequency because once we fail to
do this and once we start bluffing one of
these hands more than the other, then it's
going to create a situation where our opponent
can exploit us by calling more often with
some bluff-catchers and folding more often
with others.
And he's actually going to gain a little bit
of EV by doing so.
So what we end up with is a situation where
neither JT nor 98 are particularly good bluffs.
This brings us back to the question of what
exactly does make a good bluff?
One possible way that we can approach this
question is to understand that if we can bluff
a certain hand, without making villain adjust
in a way that makes our blockers bad, then
and only then would our hand be a good bluff.
So, going along with the same example, JT
would not qualify as a good bluff because
if we were to bluff this hand, most or all
of the time villain would adjust in a way
that makes our blockers bad.
He would just be folding AJ/AT and calling
A9/A8 instead.
So what we need is a situation where we bluff
with JT, but villain still continues to call
with AJ/AT.
This sounds almost impossible because why
would he continue calling with AJ/AT knowing
that he's blocking all of this JT and that
we are bluffing with?
It turns out that there are actually two main
scenarios where this is possible and the first
one is when our bluffs share cards without
value range.
Here I've made one small change to our toy
game.
I've added in a couple of combos of J3/T3
into the aggressor's range, and these hands
are full houses, so they actually are part
of our value range.
The idea is that the presence of these hands
in our range makes our opponent a little more
inclined to call down with AJ/AT, so it's
actually possible to have a situation where
we're bluffing with JT, and our opponent doesn't
get to adjust in the way that makes our blockers
bad.
He doesn't just get to fold AJ/AT all the
time and call A9/A8 because there's actually
something going for AJ/AT in this situation
which is that they block our nut heads.
So he's kind of in a difficult spot where
on one hand, he wants to call AJ/AT since
they remove a lot of strong hands in our range.
But on the other hand they also block a whole
lot of bluffs which is generally not a good
thing when you're bluff-catching.
So there are a lot of situations where you'll
see that the solver actually prefers to bluff
with hands that share cards with its value
range.
And the reason why it does this is because
any other strategy would leave it exploitable.
For example in this case, if we were to bluff
with 98 more often than JT our opponent would
have a really easy counter-strategy of calling
with AJ/AT all the time and folding with A9/A8
all the time.
AJ/AT these hands, they're just going to block
a whole bunch of value and block zero bluffs
in our range.
And similarly, A9/A8 are going to be terrible
calls because they only block bluffs and zero
value.
Once our opponent starts to adjust in this
way - now when you look at it from our perspective,
naturally JT is going to be an excellent bluff.
No matter what kind of strategy we start off
with, our opponent will always adjust in a
way that makes the equilibrium shift back
towards JT being a much better bluff than
98.
And once again the reason for that is that
it shares cards with our value range.
Here's a question to test your understanding:
Button open BB call.
After big blind check-calls the flop and the
turn goes check-check he (BB) likes to check-jam
8x and 9x on the river because:
A) We block the nuts. B)
We share cards with our value range.
C) All of the above
if your answer was C then you are, unfortunately,
incorrect.
The correct answer is B)
We share cards with our value range.
And the reason why A) is not a factor is because
button has actually bet all of the straights
on the turn.
This is quite a high SPR situation so that's
there's quite a big opportunity cost of checking
back the nuts.
Generally speaking, when the stacks are quite
deep you just want to fast-play your strong
hands.
Especially in position instead of checking
behind and just playing like such a small
pot on the river you basically lose all hope
of stacking your opponent.
That's why when we look at button's range
on the river, we see that he really doesn't
have like any significant amount of straights.
But still 8x and 9x make pretty good hands
to check-raise.
In fact, they are the main bluffs that we're
choosing when you look at what our check-jamming
range is made up of.
So this once again has to do with trying to
choose bluffs that share cards with our value.
Since the bulk of our value range is 98 it
makes sense to choose hands that contain an
eight or nine, since our opponent is going
to be quite inclined to call with hands like
Ace 9 as well as Ace 8 you can see that these
hands are actually some of his best bluff-catchers.
He's much more inclined to call something
like Ace 9 as opposed to Ace King or Ace Queen
simply because Ace 9 blocks a good chunk of
our value range.
I want to take this chance to introduce some
of the new features that got released in the
latest update.
If you click on the summary tab, you'll see
a couple of new columns that say value removal
as well as trash removal.
What these numbers really signify is, for
example,
if we look at it from big blinds perspective,
a high value removal score simply means that
you block lots of your opponent's value bets.
A low value removal score means that you do
not block any value bets in your opponent's
range.
So this works on a scale from 1 to 10, and
if we take a look at some of these T9 and
T8 hands, you can see that they really do
not have great value removal.
That's because when you look at button's value
batting range, you can see that the bulk of
his value range is really Ace-x.
Once again the turn has gone check-check so
it's really not going to have that many straights
and sets and two pairs.
Many of the two pair hands that he has actually
do contain an Ace.
That's the reason why from the BB's perspective,
it's so powerful to have a hand that contains
an Ace.
Looking at the value removal scores you can
see that most of these Ace-x hands they have
a score of 9 to 10.
And there's a certain threshold where you
go down to somewhere around A6 you can see
that the value removal score drops drastically.
So basically, any hand with an ace is going
to remove a big part of your opponent's value
betting range.
Any hand without an ace it's just not going
to do a great job of blocking your opponent's
value.
And so the same goes with hands like T9 and
T8 - you can see they really do not have a
great value removal score - but still they
make excellent bluff check-raises because
they share cards with our value range.
Since the bulk of our value check-jamming
range is 98 it kind of makes our opponent
more inclined to call with hands like Ace
8 and Ace 9.
You can kind of tell from Ace 9's high value
removal score that it does a good job of blocking
all of these straights in the big blind's
range.
Whereas a hand like Ace King by comparison
it's really not going to remove that much
of our opponent's value.
There's also one more new feature that I want
to show and that's this tab called BLOCKERS.
So when you hover over the Ace of clubs for
example it says if your opponent holds the
Ace of clubs your fold frequency will increase
by 0.63%.
And what this means is that if the big blind
holds the Ace of clubs button will end up
folding by an extra 0.63% which makes a lot
of sense because the bulk of button's calling
range actually contains an ace, so naturally
if the big blind holds an ace he's going to
make the button fold a little bit more.
And we can also sort by folding frequency
and you'll see that all of the cards that
have the best removal effect are the cards
that make the button fold more often - they're
basically all pairs to the board.
So Ax Tx 7x 6x you can see they have a positive
removal effect where if you have one of these
pairs or you you're going to get a little
bit more folds than if you don't.
So this also explains why the big blind is
so interested in turning lots of these one-pair
hands into a bluff such as T9 and T8.
Of course we would ideally want to have like
two pairs in our hand, but in that case our
hand would just be a value check-raise instead
of a bluff.
So the best we can do is to use some kind
of one-pair hand without that much showdown
value.
Basically, anything Tx and below is not going
to have that much showdown value in the sense
that it's really just a pure bluff-catcher.
We've already seen how button's betting range
is polarized between Ace-x and bluffs so it
doesn't really matter that much whether we
have a T or 6 or 7 or even some kind of King
High, for that matter.
These hands are really all just pure bluff-catchers.
So once again, the best that we can do is
to choose some kind of one-pair hand with
a kicker that doesn't remove too much of our
opponent's folding range.
If we scroll down the order what we see is
that the best unpaired cards to check-raise
with are more or less the eights and the nines.
So for example, when we hold the nine of spades
our opponent's folding frequency will increase
by 0.04% which is pretty much nothing at all.
So 8x and 9x they're more or less neutral
cards and that's really the best that we can
hope for.
So with T9 for example the 10 would have a
pretty good removal effect in terms of getting
more folds.
The 9 would be somewhat neutral.
But that's way better than choosing something
like uh you know KT or QT for example.
You can see as we scroll further down some
of these higher card hands that don't share
cards with our value range they actually have
a pretty poor removal.
And you can kind of tell from the hand grid
as well uh button this folding like AK/AQ/AJ
almost all the time, so naturally it's going
to make these cards much worse to bluff with
(as BB).
Let's do a quick recap.
So far what we've seen is that in order for
a hand to qualify as a good bluff it needs
to have this fundamental property whereby
we can bluff it all the time and it doesn't
make villain adjust in a way that makes our
blockers bad.
We've seen that one of the ways that this
is possible is when our bluffs share cards
with our value range.
But the second way that we can satisfy this
criterion is when our bluffs are scarce.
Here we have a second toy game, and once again
I've just made one very small change to the
aggressor's range.
Instead of having JTs and 98s as bluffs, I've
given him JTs and I've replaced 98s with 98o.
So everything else remains the same - our
value range is still AK and our opponent still
has a bunch of Ace-x bluff catchers.
Only different lies in the relative weights
of JT and 98.
98 being an offsuit combo we're definitely
going to have much more of that, and just
to make the effect a little bit more pronounced,
I've actually further decreased the weight
of JTs so we end up with a range that has
a huge amount of 98 and very little JT.
And you can see that the solver just wants
to bluff with JT all the time
The reason why our opponent doesn't get to
adjust in a way that makes our blockers bad
is because even though we're bluffing with
JT at 100% frequency, it doesn't necessarily
mean that JT will be a big part of our bluffing
range.
Because the fact is we just have so many more
combos of 98 that even if you're bluffing
it relatively infrequently when you look at
the composition of our bluffing range it's
still going to have way more 98 than JT, and
this actually allows for a situation where
we're bluffing with JT all the time but our
opponent still prefers to call with a AJ and
AT.
And this is why there are lots of situations
where the solver will prefer bluffing combos
that are more scarce.
It's kind of like in real life where if you
have a scarce item it's naturally going to
be worth more.
And our opponent isn't really going to adjust
in the way that makes our blockers bad because
he would actually have to call A9 and A8 in
order to fold more AJ and AT.
It just doesn't make sense at all for him
to do that when we have more 98 in our range
compared to JT.
So in lines where it gets checked to the river,
emphasis on "check to the river", how should
we choose our bluffs?
A) We want to bluff with hands that block
the missed flush draw.
B)
We want to bluff with hands that unblock the
missed flush draw.
C) it doesn't matter.
The correct answer is A) We want to bluff
with hands that block the missed flush draw.
At first this sounds a little strange because
we're all so used to hearing that we don't
want to bluff with the missed flush draw since
we block our opponents missed flush draw that
are folding but that's usually true in lines
where we are barreling down and our opponent
is calling twice with his flush draws and
folding all of them on the (brick) river.
So in that case yes we wouldn't really want
to interfere with his folding range but in
this example we actually have a check-down
line so this is the complete opposite of a
triple-barrel line.
Our flush draws have a lot of equity and a
lot of potential to improve, they usually
want to bet the flop and the turn.
So for every additional street that we check
we remove more and more flush draws from both
player's ranges, so by the time we get to
the river you can see that the big blind for
example really does not have very many two
spade hands in his range.
Whereas if I exclude hands that have a spade
you can see there's just a ton of these hands.
Stuff like Jack eight of Hearts 96 of clubs.
And if you hover over any one of these boxes
you'll see that there's way more combos of
hearts and clubs and diamonds relative to
spades.
And as a result, we once again have this situation
where we prefer bluffing with spades all the
time because spades are much more scarce and
we can actually bet them at full frequency
without making our opponent adjust in a way
that's bad for us.
So when we bluff with jack-x or spades for
example it doesn't make our opponent react
by folding more often with his bluff-catchers
that contain the Jack of spades.
In fact when you look at Jack 10 you can see
that we he actually calls Jack 10 with the
Jack of speeds more often than Jack 10 without
the Jack of spades.
If we look at the blocker scores of these
hands what we should see is that if we have
the spade we actually have slightly better
trash removal.
So remember that a low trash removal score
means that you do not block as many any trash
hands and as many bluffs in your opponent's
range.
Whereas a higher trash removal score means
that you block more trash in your opponent's
range.
So even though the big blind is bluffing more
often with the Jack of spades it doesn't mean
that Jack-X of spades is a big part of his
bluffing range.
And this is very clearly reflected in the
trash removal scores.
So there was a question earlier on in the
chat where someone asked why Ace-5 is checking
so much more often compared to the rest of
our trips, and this is where the blocker's
tab can really come in handy.
So let's say you are looking at the Sim and
you're trying to figure out why A5 specifically
is checking so often.
What you can do is go to the line where big
blind checks to the button and click on this
Blockers Tab.
When we sort by checking frequency, what we
see is that the cards that make our opponent
check back the most are actually mostly Ace-x
hands.
When we (BB) have the ace of diamonds for
example, we end up (decreasing) button's check
behind by 1.7%.
Which is quite significant.
And that's a great thing when we are trapping
with a very strong hand, because the last
thing we want to see is for our opponent to
check back a ton.
Whereas if we have a kicker that reduces this
check back frequency, then he actually ends
up betting more often, and that in turn allows
us to put in a check-raise that much more
often.
So that's the reason why Ace-5 specifically
is very interested in checking, whereas if
you compare it to something like T5 on the
other hand you can see that when we hold the
10 in our hand we we actually increase our
opponent's checking frequency.
And this is presumably because a big chunk
of his value betting range in this line is
10x so you don't really want to remove a 10
because that's going to make him check back
much more often and again that's not a great
thing when you are looking to trap with some
kind of strong hand.
So we can make a prediction here which is
that: if we have a hand like T5 we (BB) should
be much more inclined to just go ahead and
bet for value - checking wouldn't make quite
as much sense knowing that our opponent is
going to check back an extra 1.5 or 1.6 percent
more.
And that is in fact what we do see, T5 is
betting pretty much all the time because it
doesn't have quite as good properties for
slow-play compared to Ace 5.
We can also use the blockers tab to visualize
the best bluffs in the big blind's range.
So in this case we would have to go to the
betting line.
When we look at the various cards in the big
blind's range and how they affect the buttons
folding frequencies, you can actually see
that there is quite a big difference between
spade bluffs compared to other suits.
For example, when we hold the Ace of Spades
we actually make the button fold an extra
0.39% compared to ace of hearts or diamonds
or clubs where these cards are more or less
neutral and in fact they even have like a
slight negative effect because we make our
opponent fold a little bit less, this folding
frequency decreases by 0.18% which is not
a great thing when we are bluffing.
Same goes with the Jack of Spades as well,
very noticeably a good blocker.
We make our opponent fold an extra 0.6% more
whereas the other suits have a pretty bad
impact in the sense that they make the button
call a little bit more often.
So far we've seen that one of the reasons
why this is happening is because spades are
scarce hands with respect to our own range,
so we can bluff them all the time and our
opponent will still be quite inclined to call
with bluff-catchers that contain a spade.
But I can already see some questions in the
chat asking whether this also has something
to do with the fact that our opponent has
less spades, because just like how we are
betting most of our flush draws on the Flop
and the turn, the same thing applies to the
button as well.
He's going to be betting most of
his high equity draws on earlier streets
so when it gets checked to the river, button
also naturally has less spades in his range.
And it would seem like this makes the big
blind spades much better to buff with.
Maybe it even seems like a more important
factor than scarcity, and certainly you know
unblocking your opponent's missed draws - that's
the sort of thing that people typically put
a lot of weight to.
But there is a reason why I personally don't
think that unblocking missed draws is as important
as bluffing hands that are scarce.
And this reason is probably best explained
using a toy game.
So let's make a few changes to our baseline
toy game.
I'm going to keep the aggressor's range the
same, and just make a few changes to the defender's
range.
I'm going to add in a bunch of 94 and 84.
So these hands represent missed draws that
are always folding because they don't have
any showdown value.
They're losing to all of the aggressors bluffs.
So let's run this new toy game and see what
we get.
Before we take a look at the solution I encourage
you guys to make a guess in terms of what
we expect to see you know probably most people
would imagine that we would just stop dumping
with 98 now since we we block a bunch of hands
that are always folding but in take a minute
to think about it because the solution is
really not what you would probably expect.
So it turns out that even after we include
all of these missed draws in our opponent's range 
98 is still bluffing at the exact same
frequency as JT 
and is doing this in spite of the fact that it's blocking a whole bunch of folds.
The reason why the solver doesn't mind
bluffing with 98 is because the defender is
actually compensating for all of these missed
draws that are folding by calling A9 and A8 more often.
Because once he fails to do this, and let's
say he calls every single Ace-x at the same
frequency, now when you look at it from the
aggressor's perspective it's gonna to be much
better for us to bluff with a hand like JT.
So we would basically adjust by bluffing JT
all the time and giving up with 98 all the time.
And in that case, there would no longer be
any reason for our opponent to continue calling
with AJ and AT.
So what he needs to do is call with A9 and
A8 a little bit more often such that we are
indifferent to bluffing with both JT and 98.
Basically he's just playing a strategy that
makes our blockers a little bit less powerful
so that we cannot increase our EV by choosing
certain specific bluffs that have very good
removal and then just giving up the ones with
bad removal.
Of course, all of this is only possible if
our opponent is able to compensate for the
fact that he's folding all of these missed
draws.
So, for example, if we take away all these
combos of a AJ through A8 that interact with
the missed draws in some way, and we replace
them with bluff-catchers that don't share
cards with his missed draws, then of course
from the aggressors perspective, JT is just
going to make a much better bluff.
In this case we can see JT is bluffing almost
all the time and 98 is giving up all the time
because 98 blocks a bunch of folds and our
opponent isn't able to compensate for that
by calling A9 and A8 more often for example. 
So the takeaway here is that whether or
not you block folds in your opponent's range
that's something that is going to it's definitely
going to be important in certain situations
such as this one but at the same time there's
also going to be a lot of other situations
where your opponent is actually able to compensate
for the fact that he's folding these missed 
draws.
And let's say if you're playing online and you're playing four or five tables you already have a very limited amount of time for every decision that you make.
So in my opinion, it's not very practical to be trying to figure out stuff like "when is my born unable to compensate for the fact that he has missed draws?"
And same thing for blocking nut hands as well.
We can run a very similar toy game. So let's go back to our
baseline toy game where the defender has AJ-A8
and I'm also going to add in a bunch
of J3/T3 to our opponent's range.
Most players are going to think that this would make us more inclined to buff with JT since we now block the nuts.
but once again this is something our opponent can
compensate for.
you can see out of position is buffing JT at exactly the same frequency as 98, because 
even though JT blocks some portion of nut hands in our opponent's range, ultimately he's able to
compensate for that by folding AJ/AT a little bit more often. So when it comes to unblocking missed draws,
or blocking nut hands, these are things that only apply in certain specific situations
And it's actually pretty difficult to figure out like when it applies and when it doesn't.
So I think a much more practical approach is just to focus on the first two concepts that we've covered so far which are:
choosing bluffs that share cards with your value range as well as choosing bluffs that are scarce. 
because these two things will always apply in any situation.
Here's an actual example
of a situation where it's not that important
whether or not we block the missed flush draw.
So this is button versus big blind. 
Button is barreling down on a two-tone board, and
the flush doesn't get there on the river.
So if we filter for all of buttons unpaired hands, we do see
a preference for bluffing with hands that unblock the missed flush draw. 
But then again, there's also plenty of combos such as JT and QJs 
We don't really see any kind of preference for preference for not having spades.
JT is still bluffing at a healthy frequency, in spite of the fact that we do block quite a few missed flush draws.
You can tell from the blocker score of your hand
When we have specifically JT of spades we have a trash removal score of 6 
Which means that we block a whole lot of junk in our opponent's range that will always fold vs our bet.
whereas if we have JT of hearts or diamonds or clubs
we have a really good thrash removal score.
Because we don't interfere with as much of 
our opponent's folding range.
but despite this, you can see that all of these hands have identical EV.
Regardless of our suits, all of these hands are indifferent between betting and checking.
and the reason for this is that if you look at the big blind's response vs our bet he's actually able to compensate for the fact
that he's folding a bunch of extra missed flush
draws by calling with hands such as king Jack
with the Jack of Spades more often and once
again he's designing his strategy in a way
that makes our blockers less powerful because
if he didn't do this and let's say if he call
all of his King Jack at the same frequency
then of course we will just always give up
with JT of spades and bluff with hearts
and diamonds and clubs. 
And we would actually be able to gain a little bit of EV that way.
By making sure that he's calling KJ with the Jack of spades at a slightly higher frequency he puts us in a much tougher spot.
And this is the reason why the solver 
really doesn't mind bluffing with hands like
JT of spades or QJ of spades.
So if we look at how the various cards in
buttons range affect big blinds frequencies,
you actually see that - let's say when we look
at the Jack or the 10 it really doesn't matter
that much whether we have the Jack of spades
or the Jack of hearts. All of these cards have
a slightly negative removal effect. 
Same goes with the T of Spades, really not that different
from T of hearts or T of diamonds because
even though the T of Spades is blocking some
extra missed flush draws, our opponent is also
more inclined to call with KT with the
10 of spades. So these two factors tend to cancel each other out.
So let's take a look at one more example this time where it actually does make a difference whether or not we block
the missed flush draws. 
So here we have a slightly different situation where the ranges are much tighter, so small blind is three betting against
early position but the board is exactly the
same. We're barreling down on the two-tone
board and the flush draw also bricks out. So let's
take a look at some of the small blinds' potential bluffs.
If we filter for ace high or worse
now we actually see quite a big difference
in terms of whether or not we prefer to bluff
with spades. Here you can see that spades are
almost pure checking with the exception
of some lower combos that don't block as much
of our opponent's range. And if we exclude
spades a these hands are betting at a much higher
frequency - almost slightly more than three
quarters of the time. And this is because compared
to the previous example, you can see that having
a spade in our hand actually reduces our opponent's
folding frequency by quite a bit more so the
Jack of spades in this case actually causes
us to get almost two percent less folds compared
to hearts and diamonds and clubs that still
have a slight negative effect but not quite
as pronounced as the Jack of spades or the
10 of spades as well. And just like in the
previous toy game that we looked at this
is happening because the defender is unable
to compensate for the fact that he's folding
all of these extra missed flush draws. In the
previous sim where ranges were slightly wider
he had a bunch of KJ and KT with
a spade that he could call a little bit more often
but because this is small blind versus
utg, utg doesn't have any King-x off suit 
So this straight-up makes it pretty bad
for the small blind to be bluffing with spades.
In conclusion, when we're choosing bluffs we
want to be looking out for two main things:
We want to choose Bluffs that are scarce.
We want to choose Bluffs to share cards with our value range. 
and what we've seen is that
these are the two main ways that we can continue
bluffing our hand and not have our opponent
adjust in a way that makes our blockers bad.
When it comes to blocking the nuts or unblocking
missed draws, these are things that are sometimes
important but not always, so it makes a little
bit more sense to focus on scarcity as well
as card sharing, since we are going to have
limited time for every decision that we're making.
It's just a little bit more practical
to focus on the things that are always true.
If you can achieve 80% of the accuracy with
20% of the effort, then that's definitely a good result in my book.
But if you want to be a little bit more precise then when you're
thinking about blocking the nuts or unblocking
missed draws, just make sure that it's not a situation
where your opponent can compensate for these
things by calling or folding some of his bluff-catchers a little bit more often.
