### TOPIC: how to punish passive poker players
have you ever played against an opponent 
who you knew was making a lot of passive  
mistakes but you weren't sure how to actually 
adapt against them if you're playing in soft  
games this will be a very common scenario so 
it's important to know your exploits in this  
video we'll use GTO wizard ai's node locking 
feature to build some high value exploitive
strategies before we get started with the video

thank you hi Wizards I'm Matt hunt and today 
we're going to be talking about exploiting  
passive opponents first let's clarify what we 
mean by passive opponents since that's a fairly  
broad term there are two main criteria we're 
applying here we're going to define a passive  
opponent as one who is both underfolding and 
under aggressing that means that when facing  
a bet they're calling with hands which should 
fold and they're also calling with hands which  
should raise when not facing a bet they're 
checking too much in general and missing both  
value bets and bluffing opportunities they're 
not really capable of value betting thinly and  
they have virtually no outright Bluffs in their 
range in most spots they might bet or raise some  
of their very strongest draws on the earlier 
streets but even that isn't always the case in  
general they're exactly the kind of player you 
would want to play against but it might not be  
that easy to actually figure out the best way to 
exploit them that's what we're going to figure  
out today looking at how we should play various 
spots against a stereotypical passive opponent  
to maximize our but before we proceed let's 
also establish the two main kinds of exploits  
that we're thinking about here retroactive and 
preemptive exploits a retroactive exploit is one  
where we're adapting to a mistake an opponent 
already made on an earlier Street or with an  
earlier action on the current Street for example 
if we believe our opponent was underfolding the  
previous Street their range for arriving at 
the turn will be wider than it should be and  
we can build a strategy for the turn based on 
that assumption importantly this approach does  
not make any assumptions about how they'll 
play on the current street so in the above  
scenario we would be assuming that they would 
play the turn correctly even after making flop  
mistakes obviously this is unrealistic so we 
have to combine this type of exploit with the  
other type preemptive exploits are aimed at 
anticipating the mistakes our opponent will  
make with future actions either on the current 
Street or future streets this type of exploit  
will usually be the most effective way to maximize 
our EV but it does carry with it a bigger downside  
if our assumptions are wrong for example if we 
think they're overfolded the river but they're  
actually underfolding or vice versa it's also 
very difficult to use solvers to estimate the EV  
we gain through our opponent's mistakes on future 
streets which is why both types of exploits are  
useful even though it's very likely that an 
opponent who underfold the Flop will end up
overfolded estimate the future value of those 
turn and River over folds since GTO wizard Ai  
and other solvers don't really work that way and 
node locking every possible turn and river run out  
would be very timec consuming anyway our goal 
is to combine both these types of exploits to  
build our strategies but we always have to start 
with a retroactive approach taking into account  
the mistakes our opponent already made and then 
subsequently anticipating the ones they're going  
to make from this point onwards so with all of 
this in mind let me introduce our opponent for  
the duration of this video who's going to serve 
as our example of the classic highly passive  
player Wizards this is Mike now you might look 
at this picture and think hey I think I played  
with this guy but Mike is actually not real 
he's AI generated he's 60 years old American  
a recreational poker player and as you might 
imagine Mike plays poker very passively he  
only bets and raises for Value he doesn't like 
to fold pairs or draws and he's definitely not  
a winning player let's learn how to crush Mike by 
the way apologies to everyone out there whose name  
is Mike I just picked the most common American 
name for men born in the 1960s I'm sure there  
are plenty of miks out there who play great poker 
let's start by figuring out how to play against  
Mike on the Flop retroactively exploiting the 
fact that he likes to call a lot pre flop we're  
going to stick with using Mt ranges and scenarios 
for these analyses given that GTO wizard AI can't  
yet account for rate considerations in cash game 
spots and we're going to keep everything focused  
on the 50 big blind stack depth which gives us a 
flop spr of around seven or eight this spr would  
also be fairly applicable to certain highly 
passive cash game environments so it serves  
pretty well for our purposes we're going to start 
with a spot where we're in position post flop in  
the hijack versus Mike's big blind call and then 
move to out of position where we're once again in  
the hijack but this time Mike is calling on the 
button first let's look at how Mike's big blind  
defense range against the highjack open differs 
from the GTO approach on the left here you can  
see that the GTO range doesn't call Pure with 
a a lot of the middling suited hands and weaker  
offsuit hands it's three betting those at a good 
rate pre- flop Mike on the other hand never three  
bet Bluffs at only three bets 10 plus Ace Queen 
suited plus and Ace King off for value and he  
calls with almost the entire rest of the deck 
except for the absolute worst off suit hands  
after all he's only facing a small open Raise 
so he wants to call and try to flop a big hand  
in order to analyze the changes in our strategies 
in these spots we're going to use a metric called  
betting volume betting volume is essentially 
a combination of cat frequency and Cat size  
it takes all of the cats that we use in a given 
spot or bets in a given spot and multiplies the  
frequencies together to get an overall sense of 
how much money we're putting into the pot we're  
doing this because the changes in ranges from 
the GTO approach to Mike's approach are going  
to cause both changes in frequencies and changes 
in sizing to our cets and the nuances of that are  
not necessarily something we need to go into in 
depth right now we're mostly just looking at how  
much money are we willing to put into the pot on 
the flop in various scenarios so we're going to  
use betting volume as our metric here and monitor 
how it changes from one spot to another so this  
graphic right here gives us a good sense of 
how our cat volume changes across a variety  
of different flops I've got eight different 
flops here starting with Ace King 5 rainbow  
Ace a 6 rainbow King 106 flush draw Queen 76 
rainbow Jack 75 monotone 1096 flush draw 883  
rainbow and 654 flush draw those eight boards are 
a pretty good cross-section of the overall nature  
of flop textures and as you can see here from 
the average at the bottom our betting volume is  
going up when Mike is in the hand we're going 
from 32% in GTO to 37% against Mike so this is  
our retroactive exploit for Mike's wide pre- flop 
calling range and there's a couple of noteworthy  
things about these eight boards there are some 
boards that don't really change and those are  
the ones where we were already range betting the 
Flop anyway so for example the A6 rainbow and the  
King 106 flush drawer we were already betting at 
100% frequency with a certain sizing 25% or 39%  
and we simply continue doing that against Mike the 
queen 76 is very interesting because our betting  
volume goes up massively on that board we're 
actually switching from small bets to over bets  
on that board here which is partially why that 
frequency's gone up so high Mike has a lot of  
gut shots that we're able to put pressure on and 
we're getting a lot more value from our over pairs  
there with those big bets conversely on the 1096 
flush draw Mike's range now contains more combos  
of two pairs straights and hands that contain a 
lot of equity pair plus gutshot type hands flush  
draw type hands those types of things Mike now 
has a lot of those hands on this texture that he  
previously didn't have because as you remember the 
middle card suited hands were actually doing a lot  
of three betting in GTO here when Mike doesn't 
three bet those hands he now has a lot more gut  
shots on the queen 76 but he has a lot more pairs 
two pairs and straights on the 1096 another board  
that's changing slightly is the 654 flush draw you 
can see that it was previously the lowest betting  
volume Board of all the eight now it's going 
up slightly because Mike has more overcards and  
hands that don't interact with this texture that 
in GTO he's supposed to three bet pre flop but  
now he doesn't and he just has to check fold them 
on this board so overall our frequency's going up  
by about 5% it's not massively altering some of 
our sizes are changing but as a whole as as you  
can see we're exploiting Mike's range by going 
with more cats higher volume and just generally  
being more willing to put money into the pot 
on the Flop here so I'm going to do a short  
experiment just to wrap up this section I'm going 
to go over to GTO wizard Ai and run five random  
boards against Mike's big blind range just to give 
you a snapshot of how some of these strategies are  
looking and show you that across the board here 
we're really going to be looking at some fairly  
High aggression levels just based on how wide 
Mike's range is so this right here is our first  
board in the same spot it's the 84 Deuce with two 
clubs and as you can see the solver actually wants  
to go with a half pot size here and it's going 
to be at a high frequency almost 90% frequency  
so it's actually pretty close to being a range bet 
for half pot on this low card board Mike just has  
a lot of random overcards here that we can deny 
Equity to our over pairs are very strong and if  
we look at the range breakdown he still has 37% 
trash hands so it's still a very good spot for  
us even though it's low cards he just has so many 
hands that are weak on this board and as you can  
see we have a very significant nut advantage 
17.6% to 1.7% best hands so pretty good spot  
for us here if we flip the board we now get a 975 
rainbow let's see what we get as a strategy for  
this one I have disallowed Mike from dong betting 
here so we're not going to see any leads because I  
imagine Mike's not going to do much leading and 
in this spot we actually are using a full pot  
size but about half the time so again still a fair 
amount of aggression it's just bigger sizing being  
used again our over pairs are very strong and even 
though Mike can have all the Straits still a good  
spot for us to put some money in let's look at 
Board number three this one's going to be ace 832  
diamonds this one I expect to probably be a small 
bet board but we shall see yep it is a small bet  
board and frequency wise we are going to probably 
come out as a range bet yeah it's a range bet so  
range bet for quarter pot here on a83 it's going 
to work very well not really too much need to do  
anything particularly Innovative there lots of 
trash hands Queen 10 4 all clubs this is going to  
be an interesting one we'll probably see a small 
bet here maybe at a fairly high frequency oh okay  
so we are going medium bet we're going about half 
pot 87% of the time so this is it's not too common  
to see half pot Plus on monotone boards but it 
does make sense here given that obviously Mike has  
a lot of offsuit hands potentially even a lot of 
offsuit hands that he shouldn't actually have so  
we're kind of giving a bad price to some of those 
low card single Club hands and obviously we're  
getting a lot of value from some of our stronger 
hands and then finally we will go to the last  
board here which is 1098 rainbow so this is Board 
number five and here we're going with the half pot  
size once again just because we have a lot of good 
hands here and again it's a high frequency so a  
lot of high frequencies here some range bets 
some range bets even for half pot or bigger  
some bigger Bets with maybe a 50% frequency or so 
but there's not going to be too many boards which  
come out at low betting frequencies just because 
Mike's range is so wide that as you can see even  
on a board like this he has 40% trash hands so 
just going to be pretty easy to justify a lot of  
aggression against Mike here going to put him in 
a lot of tough spots with some some big bets and  
with some small range bets on certain boards but 
basically we're just going to play pretty aggro  
so to summarize our Baseline strategy from in 
position against Mike here we're retroactively  
exploiting the fact that he's calling too wide 
pre flop by SE betting more often and by being  
more willing to use larger sizings in the right 
spots a lot of boards are going to become range  
bet boards because our overall range Advantage is 
so significant and Mike has so much trash in his  
range while some boards are actually going to 
become range bets for a half po sizing or even  
bigger sometimes as opposed to just being range 
bets for quarter part or less so really we're  
going to be able to justify a lot more aggression 
bigger sizings on some boards range betting a lot  
of boards just going to be very favorable for us 
because Mike has so much garbage that he shouldn't  
be calling pre flop next let's let's shift into 
looking at our out of position approach if we once  
again compare Mike's approach to the GTO range 
we can see that the GTO range includes a lot of  
mixing with many different combos in fact very few 
hands are calling pure in this spot Mike however  
is calling pure with a ton of different hands 
including some which are pure folds at equilibrium  
like 85 suited or 43 suited he's also only three 
betting with Jax plus and Ace King so his range  
is relatively protected by some strong hands 
like tens and Ace Queen suited even though this  
obviously isn't a deliberate effort on his part 
it's just a product of his General passiveness if  
we look at our CET volume changes in this spot you 
can see that while there is an overall increase of  
about 5% just like there was in the in position 
spot there are actually quite a few spots here  
where our general level of aggression has not 
really changed very much and our betting volume  
has not really altered significantly there aren't 
really too many spots like the queen 76 where it  
went up massively or like the 1096 where it went 
down massively just small tweet tweaks here and  
there maybe the king 106 bit of a bigger tweak but 
even that is only a 9% difference here let's take  
a look at why this is happening this right here 
is the example from the 10962 tone board in the  
outer position spot in this case our CET frequency 
has stayed pretty much the same even decreasing  
a little bit here and the main reason for this is 
that widening our opponent's calling range hasn't  
actually altered the equity distributions of the 
spot very much at all the equity graphs here can  
show us what I mean by that on the left here is 
the graph for the equilibrium spot where we're  
up against the GTO range on the right is the 
graph for when we're playing against Mike as  
you can see the equity distributions are very 
very similar with only a few minor differences  
between the two the reason for this is that while 
adding a bunch more hands to Mike's range did make  
his range about 50% wider containing roughly 300 
combos compared to roughly 200 in the GTO range  
it didn't significantly alter the nature of the 
range we added more weak hands but we also added  
more strong hands as well in fact Mike actually 
has very slightly more strong hands than a GTO  
player would in this spot on this board the 
trade-off is that because he's flatting a lot  
more pre flop in the first place he's a lot more 
vulnerable to being squeezed by the players behind  
him this is a spot where the multi-way nature of 
pre- flop play can make the scope of an opponent's  
mistakes difficult to visualize it might be easy 
to think that Mike isn't making a lot of mistakes  
pre flop here when you see some of these numbers 
and these graphs but he actually is it's just that  
we're not the only one who gets to exploit those 
mistakes the blinds behind him get to exploit him  
by squeezing wider and putting us in tough spots 
with his dead money in the pot let's now do the  
same thing that we did before and run a sample 
of a few random flops just to see how our outer  
position strategy is altering against Mike as a 
whole we shouldn't see too many massive changes  
here based on these factors that we've identified 
first one that we have here is this king queen  
Jack two Spades in this spot we are using a 
39% or 40% really flop sizing here with about  
34% frequency so it's not becoming a drastically 
aggressive board for us we are doing some betting  
some checking we're really just targeting all of 
Mike's pocket pairs looking to put them in tough  
spots with some smallish to medium siiz bets here 
so nothing really too unexpected about this board  
if we look at the next one it's going to be 
a king five Deuce rainbow this board is once  
again going to be a 40% board except this time 
we're betting a little bit more often Mike has a  
little bit more of that trash in his range because 
of the high frequency that he's flatting a lot of  
those middle card hands a lot of those Broadways 
so this becomes a little bit better of a board for  
us to be able to not necessarily range bet but 
bet a little bit more often you can see that we  
do have a decent chunk of Advantage here in the 
upper middle portion of the range and Mike still  
does have about 28% trash in his range if we go to 
the next board this one's going to be a king 103  
with two hearts this one is now going to be a big 
bet board full pop bet but only a 25% frequency so  
we're really applying MAX Pressure here to some 
of those gut shots and peir type hands that Mike  
has and for the most part we are doing a lot of 
checking again because he has a lot of hands that  
interact with this board fairly well and if we go 
with the next board we are doing Ace king deuce  
with two Spades this one is going to be a very 
good board for our range in terms of nut hands  
as you can see where using a big bet again 100% 
pot we are quite polarized here and we're not  
able to bet that often because Mike does still 
have plenty of acex hands and King X hands that  
can continue here but we are able to really apply 
some pressure there leveraging this nut advantage  
that we have we have 22% or so best hands compared 
to 14% for him and finally if we go with one more  
board here it's going to be a king Jack 7 rainbow 
this is actually going to be a very interesting  
board because this is an overbet board now this 
becomes a a board where there's so many back doors  
so many gut shots here that Mike can have that 
this actually becomes now a really good board  
for a very big bet which is a little unusual here 
but we're not doing it that often we're doing it  
about a third of the time and range wise you can 
see that we're just leveraging this significant  
not advantage that we have here about 22% to 8% so 
there are some unusual strategies coming up here  
but we're not able to go with these range bets 
we're not able to go with these high frequency  
High aggression spots necessarily because as we 
identified before even though the frequency that  
Mike is calling pre flop is changing the overall 
makeup of his range is not altering massively and  
there's obviously going to be a lot of boards 
where he still has plenty of hands that have  
decent Equity so that's why we're not necessarily 
ramping up the aggression that much from out of  
position against Mike here so to summarize here 
the changes in our strategy when out of position  
against Mike are a little unpredictable overall 
we are going to be able to play slightly more  
aggressively against Mike but since his pre- FL 
range isn't quite quite as restricted to certain  
types of hands as it previously was we're going 
to see some of the boards which were previously  
really bad for our range become slightly better 
and some of the boards which were previously  
really good for our range become slightly worse in 
other words our CET strategy becomes a little bit  
less sensitive to the exact board and a bit more 
sensitive to the fact that Mike simply has a very  
wide range against which we can attack to some 
extent even from out of position next let's move  
on to looking at how we're going to exploit Mike 
on the flop in a preemptive fashion in other words  
is accounting for the mistakes which we expect 
him to make on The Flop itself from this point  
on there's going to be a lot less need for us to 
separate in position and out of position since  
Mike's Tendencies are going to be very similar 
regardless of position so we're just going to keep  
things simple for now and focus on in position 
spots one noteworthy point to make about playing  
outter position against Mike however is that 
his General tendency to very rarely bet when  
checked to is going to give us much more reason 
to play our strong hands aggressively from out of  
position while being less afraid of checking with 
a capped or vulnerable range and doing a lot of  
folding when mik does bet or raise as a result our 
overall preemptive adaptation to mik from out of  
position is going to end up with us playing fairly 
face up in most cases and if we're looking to go  
beyond that to look for additional exploits the 
principles we explore in the inos spots will still  
be a solid foundation so let's start by figuring 
out a generalized overview of our preemptive flop  
adaptations against Mike we've already discussed 
how Mike is under aggressing and underfolding so  
we're going to assume those two basic parameters 
for how plays all flops and since we're only going  
to focus on in position play for this portion of 
the video we're just going to look at a standard  
50 big blind hijack versus big blind scenario 
where Mike defends his big blind against our  
open as we looked at before so the first thing to 
address here is whether or not Mike's tendency to  
underfold against seab bets could potentially lead 
us to stop seab betting so aggressively even once  
we take into account the wide nature of his pre- 
flop range best way to test that is if we start  
with a board where we're already range betting 
so I've got got this Ace A6 rainbow board here  
where we're range betting for quarter pot size 
and we're going to nolock Mike's response to see  
if it makes us want to stop doing that now the 
response that Mike has at equilibrium here is  
he's supposed to raise a lot about 20% of the time 
and call about 20% and he's actually supposed to  
fold 60% of the time and that's one of the reasons 
why range betting is so effective for us here what  
if we have him continue way more than the 40% or 
so that he's supposed to continue what if we ESS  
flip this around and we say he's never going to 
raise but maybe he's going to only fold 40% of the  
time right and the way to do this with the node 
loock the quickest way I like to do it is just  
to put everything on fold and then just establish 
that he's never folding anything in any of these  
categories of hands he's not going to fold third 
pair we're going to not have him we're going to  
have him not fold any back door any Broadway hands 
and then let's also have him call with all of his  
King 7 plus just because he has King High and two 
overcards to the six and that seems pretty good  
we've got a pretty decent frequency in there right 
now overall frequency is at 41% fold so we've got  
him calling 60% instead of folding 60% and he's 
never raising but that's pretty reasonable now the  
final thing we have to do is just lock everything 
hit node lock in this bottom right corner and we  
should get our result in just a few seconds and 
my expectation is we're still going to be range  
betting just simply because it's a board that's 
so good for us and if he does continue with all  
these trashy hands all that's actually going to 
happen is he's going to end up having to fold the  
turn a lot more often because he's continuing with 
a bunch of weak hands and most importantly we're  
not getting raised so we never get denied our 
Equity we never get put in tough spots against  
the Rays we always get to realize equity on 
the turn check back see the river whenever  
we want so definitely not going to have to slow 
down just purely because we're not getting too  
many folds here this is going to be a spot where 
Mike's tendency to peel really wide is going to  
hurt him but what about the boards that are not 
normally range bet boards let's take a look all  
right so this next board that I have here is a 974 
monotone All Hearts board so it's kind of a tricky  
board against a range that we know includes a lot 
of flushes and as you can see at equilibrium here  
or at least with the retroactive exploit of Mike 
calling pre flop we are betting this board about  
72% of the time we're using a half pot size and 
obviously we're going to have a robust kind of a  
checking back range here we're checking back a lot 
of 7x queen queen 7 87 pocket sixes fives Etc some  
ace high pretty predictable checking back range 
for a monotone flop here now I've already run  
the node loock here to save us some time so I'm 
just going to flip over to that and here on this  
board with the node lock in place we're actually 
range betting and the reason is because I have  
Mike here playing a strategy where he is actually 
raising all of his two pair plus but he's calling  
uh huge frequency here he's basically not willing 
to fold any decent heart and he's obviously not  
folding any kind of pair gutshot Etc either and 
once again his passiveness the fact that he's  
only folding 25% of the time is actually hurting 
him here substantially because it's simply meaning  
that he's going to end up putting money in the pot 
and then folding on later streets too much so even  
though he's actually putting money in the pot way 
too often if we flip over to the equilibrium here  
he's only supposed to continue 60% of the time 
here against half pot he's supposed to raise 7%  
of the time call 52% fold 41% or so if we go back 
to the nolock he's actually raising more than that  
7% he's raising 8.1% but it's exclusively value 
it's literally only value hands so we're going  
to fold a lot to that raise which we'll talk 
talk about later but generally speaking he's  
doing so much passive calling here with a lot of 
hands that actually aren't strong enough to call  
stuff like Jack five with the five of Hearts he 
just doesn't want to fold a heart here that stuff  
is getting heavily punished on latest streets and 
it's going to mean that we actually can bet more  
often here against Mike's very passive strategy so 
overall when we're not really going to get Bluff  
raised bluffing from in position is basically a 
free roll especially when we're not even betting  
that big we're betting in this case half pot in 
the previous case quarter pot we're either going  
to take the pot down right away or we're going to 
realize our Equity at a high rate anyway or we're  
just going to be able to take the pot down at a 
high frequency on a latest Street the only times  
we don't realize our Equity are when Mike does 
have a value hand such as some of those two pairs  
flushes Etc on this board or when he decides to 
show aggression on the turn or river in which case  
if we're very confident that he's not actually 
bluffing then we don't really have to care  
about realizing our Equity because our Equity is 
very low anyway if Mike is only raising two pair  
plus then not being able to realize our Equity 
against a range that's really strong doesn't  
matter because we probably have very low Equity 
one way or the other so that's a really important  
thing to keep in mind about the nature of this 
spot so in conclusion here we should actually  
see bet more versus Mike from in position not less 
because his lack of raises really fails to punish  
us at all for our aggression we realize a lot more 
equity in bigger pots on average and bluffing from  
in position here is basically a free rle because 
sometimes he folds and when he doesn't we get to  
realize whatever Equity we have which in a lot 
of these spots is going to be pretty decent so  
overall more aggression not only for the sake 
of retroactively exploiting the fact that he's  
flatting too wide pre- flop but also preemptively 
exploiting the fact that he's going to be too  
passive on the Flop and not going to raise enough 
the next question that we have to ask here which  
is a very important one is what do we do do 
when Mike raises now this is obviously a tricky  
question because we've established that Mike 
is not raising very much and a lot of the time  
we're not going to get particularly useful info 
from people that we don't see raise very often  
because you have to rely on a rare occurrence 
of them actually raising in order to see what  
they're raising with but if we have confidence 
that Mike is Raising pure value then our response  
to that is going to be very important it's going 
to have a big bearing on our overall EV so let's  
take a look this is the previous board here that 
we just looked at the 974 monotone board and as  
you can see we have that same node lock with mic 
only raising basically flushes sets in two pairs  
and let's take a look at what our response versus 
this raise is going to look like he raises to 50%  
pot basically 3x our bet size and take a look at 
that we have a strategy where we're jamming some  
hands which is basically mostly our nut flushes 
we are calling with our non-nut flushes in most  
cases we're never folding two pair here because 
we still have outs against flushes we're never  
folding a set for the same reason we are almost 
never folding the nut flush draw except looks  
like some combos are just about in that territory 
where they're thinking about folding Ace of Hearts  
King is like splitting between jamming and folding 
so it's pretty much exactly Break Even but if we  
look at what he's supposed to do against the jam 
here we haven't locked this node so in order to  
to really get the most accurate result here we 
actually have to lock his response to the Allin  
at this point because as you can see here the 
the response has him folding stuff like 97 to  
stay balanced it has him folding Jack High flushes 
that's not really very realistic so let's finalize  
the node lock here by making sure that we have an 
accurate idea of what he's doing we're going to  
put every everything on call here and then what 
we're actually going to do is have him call with  
all of his flushes he's going to fold his two 
pairs and let's actually have him folding his  
sets so he's only calling it off with a flush 
and he's folding a set let's see what that does  
so this is the output here from the results that 
we just gave and you can see that it's actually  
fairly straightforward and relatively intuitive in 
that we are folding a massive amount of the time  
which is pretty logical considering how strong his 
range is we are getting it in primarily with the  
nut flush and some of our other strongest flushes 
any Queen High flush or better basically we're  
getting it in with we are calling with some of our 
other flushes uh actually Queen six is not getting  
it in Queen six of of Hearts is just calling King 
six is actually calling a little bit too which is  
kind of interesting as well as Ace 3 and ace deuce 
presumably because they maybe benefit a little bit  
more from unblocking certain hands interesting 
anyway the uh pocket 9es pocket sevens pocket  
fours 97 all of that stuff is live against the 
flush so that stuff is never folding Aces and  
Kings with the flush draw they're live enough 
that they can continue even Jack's very small  
frequency I guess because it has that strape flush 
out is going to have some continuing frequency  
tens though does not which is kind of curious 
but bottom line here is it's a very very tight  
response if we get raised we should fold a lot 
here we're snap folding hands like Queens with  
no heart even Queens with a heart is folding here 
and it could be a real error to continue against  
this raise with a hand like let's say Aces with no 
heart if we look at the EVS here of the different  
options continuing with Ace is no heart is losing 
about four big blinds here which is a big error  
to make in a pot of only 15 big blinds 18 big 
blinds at this point yeah there's n once he  
puts nine out there there's about 18 big blinds 
in the pot and if we put that extra six bigs to  
call with Aces no heart we're getting crushed 
to the tune of losing four big blinds so very  
important variable there that his range just is 
so so strong that we should not be continuing at  
any significant rate and we should be very very 
cautious about how we call that raise we're only  
calling with stuff that's live against flushes 
and when we have strong flushes we're basically  
just wanting to get it in so the bottom line here 
when it comes to continuing against Mike's raises  
is fold a lot we only really need to continue 
here when we're drawing live against his value  
hands and sometimes that's not even enough you 
will find some spots here where even hands that  
have equity against the value are not going to 
necessarily have enough implied odds to continue  
or potentially the stack depth is not deep 
enough for us to win more when we actually do  
win the pot so in the end we're actually going to 
make some really big folds in certain spots there  
will be times where if there's enough flushes in 
their range for example even a strong flush draw  
might want to fold uh and things like that so in 
the end folding a lot is the only real exploit  
against these players who mostly just have when 
they raise it's boring it's not flashy but you  
have to be able to do it against these really 
passive players so the next question we want to  
ask is a very interesting one it's what if Mike is 
inelastic to our bet sizing on the Flop what if he  
continues the same range against a big bet that he 
would against a small bet this is going to produce  
some interesting results so let's take a look at 
a couple of examples here so we've gone back to  
the aa6 board here as our primary example or our 
first example and as you can see I have locked  
Mike strategy here against the 25% pot bet into 
raising any Ace or better and calling a lot of  
those other hands that he was calling before what 
I've also done in is I've added a 75% pot size so  
I've added a second bet sizing option for us here 
and I've locked Mike into responding the same way  
to that size as he is to the smaller bets so he's 
got a 3X raise he's got a call and he's got a fold  
and I've locked the ex act same response so he's 
completely inelastic to our sizing here pause the  
video for a second think about what you think the 
strategy might look like and what might be best in  
this case to respond to this completely inelastic 
[Music] strategy and now here's your answer as you  
can see we now are range betting for a big size 
on Ace A6 which is very counterintuitive but what  
this is is a very extreme version of what we saw 
earlier where Mike is continuing in a very passive  
way and if he's doing that against a big bet in 
the same way as he's doing that against a small  
bet it's now going to punish him further for 
us to be using a large size and then continuing  
on the later streets because the pot is going 
to be bigger he's still going to be forced to
overfolded here here we would rather use a bigger 
size with our whole range instead of the smaller  
one which is a very interesting development 
I also have one more board where I've done  
the same thing just to allow us to have a little 
bit of a different sample here we've got a jack  
105 two Spade board where Mike is Raising all 
of his two pair or better and he's not raising  
his combo drawers or anything like that he's 
just raising two pair plus so it's a very low  
raising frequency and in this case we've got a 
half pot size and a full pot size this is the  
inelastic strategy that I've locked Mike into 
here he's continuing with all of his gut shots  
all of his back doors all sorts of hands just 
not really very willing to fold just clicking  
that call button and he's doing the same thing 
Against full pot as he would against half pot  
and take a look at what our strategy is as you can 
see we're not using the half pot anymore there are  
some hands that are favoring check at a small rate 
there's a a 5% checking frequency here but we're  
favoring this big betat we're using this full 
pot bat and we're doing it with a lot of hands  
here so really we're focusing in on creating big 
pots against a very passive opponent who's going  
to continue with nowhere near enough equity and 
we're just looking to maximize the frequency that  
we can take down that big pot on later streets 
so again Mike is in elastic here we're using big  
bets we're forcing him to continue so that we 
can take down that bigger pot so to summarize  
this section Mike's in elasticity versus our 
sizings allows us to bet big a lot more than  
we usually would do we're creating bigger pots 
for later streets and we're forcing him into  
positions where he just can't defend his range 
because it's too weak we're going to force an
overfolded the value that we get from the top of 
our range too by simply getting more money into  
the pot on the earlier streets to compensate for 
the fact that Mike isn't going to do the betting  
for us he's not going to Bluff the latest streets 
enough and this strategy of bigger bets on the  
earlier streets helps us to grow the pot and get 
that money in there when we have two pair sets  
over pairs Etc so little bit of a counterintuitive 
response perhaps but the inelasticity to sizing is  
really helping us to size up so the next question 
that we have to answer after we've established  
that Mike's in elasticity on the Flop actually 
helps us is to figure out what we're going to  
do on the turn after Mike calls because we've 
talked a lot about the fact that we're forcing  
him to continue a wider range he's continuing way 
to too often without enough equity but what do we  
actually do once we get to the turn in a spot 
like that well what I've done is I've taken the  
Jack 105 flop that we just looked at and I've 
looked at that full pot bet and what we do on  
a few different turn cards let's take a look so 
this right here is our first turn card this is  
the dece of clubs this is basically a complete 
brick and as you can see we have a pretty robust  
betting strategy we have about a 63% frequency or 
so and our value betting region is a little bit  
surprising we're actually able to bet for value 
with some 10x here this is how wide and how weak  
Mike's range is we're betting stuff like Queen 
10 we're betting even 109 of Spades stuff like  
that is betting for Value because Mike's range 
is simply so wide and so weak at this point we  
have a massive nut Advantage we have 33% almost 
best hands so almost a third of our range is not  
hands at this point Mike only has 5% because 
he was was raising the Flop with all of his  
two pair plus remember and in this case he didn't 
raise the Flop so we're in such a good spot here  
we're able to Value bet any Jack a stronger 10 
particularly 10x with Spades obviously and we're  
also betting a good chunk of our draws a lot of 
our strongest combo draws are able to bet we're  
able to bet with a lot of flush draws we've got 
some open enders in there as well just a lot of  
our most robust drawing hands plus if we look at 
the weaker hands that are betting here we're able  
to actually just Blast Off with hands like King 
seven of Hearts King seven of diamonds Queen six  
of clubs 87 for the lowend gutshot seven six of 
Hearts you know seven high with no real Equity  
here we're able to blast off with these hands not 
just because we need to have blops but because  
Mike's range is so weak for getting to this spot 
that we're simply in a situation where he cannot  
defend very effectively he's going to be forced 
to fold a lot here so we're able to Value bet  
thinner and we're able to Bluff with quite 
a variety of hands including a lot of pretty  
weak hands that usually might not be very good 
bluff combos on this turn card if we look at a  
different turn card here maybe we put up a turn 
card that completes a lot of draws maybe we put  
up something like a nine of Spades which completes 
the straight and the flush this is going to be  
obviously a very different kind of a spot and in 
theory um we still have Mike checking everything  
here there's no real necessity for him to be donk 
betting here his range just isn't strong enough  
to Warrant doing that but if we look at what our 
strategy now is we actually have a smaller size  
so once again we're using a fairly aggressive 
approach we're just not necessarily polarizing  
in the same way that we would on a brick so 
we were using the 2/3 pot size on the dece  
turn we're now using 40% here the pot is already 
pretty big there's 18 bigs out there because we  
bet full pot on the Flop so we don't necessarily 
have to go with these overly polarizing sizes we  
can use these moderate 2/3 40% kind of sizes and 
as you can see here we're able to continue value  
betting pretty liberally we've got still some 
chunks of uh 10x that are value betting stuff  
like Queen 10 is value betting here we still 
have uh even some uh 9x that's betting which  
is sort of a a bit mergy here kind of a bluff 
but not really that much of a bluff I guess we  
are still doing pretty well with 9x and if we 
look at the bluffing region uh it is obviously  
going to be some pretty trashy stuff some ACE a 
with just an eight for an open Ender the low open  
Ender but then we've got some stuff like 86 which 
is even weaker than that uh we've got 76 65 again  
some pretty weak stuff and we're also turning some 
pocket pairs into a bluff as well so we're able to  
continue quite aggressively once again we're just 
not using quite the same kind of a size if we look  
at the range breakdown Mike does have a decent 
chunk of flushes now 12% best hands instead of  
the 3% that he had on the previous spot so we are 
a little bit more cautious but because his range  
is still very wide he still has 35% trash hands 
we still do get to play relatively aggressively  
so not a spot where we have to massively slow down 
if we now shift back to looking at the ac6 rainbow  
spot what I have here is a version of this Sim 
where I've locked Mike to always check Ray and  
Ace on the Flop and never call with anything an as 
or better so he's actually extraordinarily capped  
in the range that he continues versus the small 
betat here we've eliminated the large bat here  
just for Simplicity we're not necessarily going 
to worry about the an elasticity here we're just  
looking at what happens purely if he continues 
with that very capped range and as you can see  
on this dece turn he's so capped that we're now 
going with a big overb we're going with this 116%  
of pot and we're actually doing it with our entire 
range or virtually our entire range so this is a  
spot that is so favorable for us we have almost 
most 40% best hands and he has 0.7 he literally  
only has one full house which is Deuces so if he's 
raising every single Ace here we get to blast off  
with complete impunity with virtually everything 
this is an obviously very extreme example but this  
is a good sort of guideline here of if you really 
feel like when he calls here he just never has an  
ace maybe it's it's a live game and you have a 
live ta sort of a thing going on maybe you just  
feel like you know exactly how this guy plays and 
he just always raises the Flop if he has an Ace  
and you bet small this is what you can do you 
can pound in a big bet with every single hand  
so pretty extreme adaptation but a good guideline 
of what these exploits actually look like against  
these super passive players who only raise value 
so to wrap up this section as you could see from  
these examples on brick turns we get to blast off 
a lot we get to use some big sizes especially when  
Mike is extremely capped these turn cards allow us 
to put in a lot of money here the betting volume  
is going to be very high and even though the 
non bricks are going to require a little bit  
more Nuance we're going to have to be a bit more 
structured in how we bet and maybe we don't use  
quite such big sizes because he's going to be 
a little bit less capped we are still going to  
be able to show a good degree of aggression and 
no matter what here the overall weakness of his  
range even if it isn't that capped he's going to 
struggle to defend it you saw that even on the  
turnone card where he could have a lot of flushes 
and some Straits we still were able to show about  
63% or so aggression we were betting quite often 
there so it's not going to be that we're going to  
have to slow down a lot it's just really going to 
moderate our sizing a little bit more so than our  
actual frequency so the next question we're 
going to have to ask here is does the river  
function the same way as the turn what if Mike 
is continuing beyond the turn with way way too  
many hands what if he just doesn't want to fold 
a draw and maybe the only stuff that he folds on  
the turn is going to be the stuff that didn't get 
that back door drawer that he was looking for well  
let's find out so the example that we're going 
to use here is this Jack 10 5 once again in this  
case we bet full pot on the Flop and Mike calls 
we're going to get that Deuce of Clubs blank turn  
he's going to check we're going to use this 2/3 
pot sizing and I'm going to walk you through the  
node lock that we're going to implement here for 
Mike's range when we that we're going to have him  
pretty much Jam anything that still has or that 
has just turned two pair plus so we're going to  
go right here and we're going to first of all 
just set everything on fold just for Simplicity  
and then we're going to go straight to the jam and 
we're going to say if he has a set which is Deuces  
the only set he can have if he has two pair he's 
going to check Jam that's all we're going to do  
we're never going to have him check jamming with a 
bluff because as we've seen he's the most passive  
player ever we're going to have him always call 
his top pair always call his second pair always  
call his third pair cuz he doesn't like to fold 
pairs remember low pair he's even going to call  
fours and threes here because maybe he just 
thinks we have a draw and then we're going to  
have him call any combo draw any nut flush draw 
any flush draw although we're going to have to  
go back to that flush draw that also has two 
pair any open Ender and any gutshot so we're  
really only going to have him fold the stuff that 
has no pair no draw essentially and he's going to  
continue everything else so let's node lock and we 
will see what happens and this is our new strategy  
right here what you'll see is that it's become a 
little bit more linear if you focus your energy  
on this Equity buckets breakdown down here you 
can see that there's kind of a linear to where  
the edges of these categories are I like to use 
this as a pretty good guideline line here if we  
look at a polarized range a polarized range would 
be that we would have our best hands betting at a  
higher frequency our trash hands betting at 
ey frequency and our good hands and our weak  
hands betting a bit less often right we might see 
a bit more of a curve to it we might see something  
like that right but a less polarized range a more 
linear range is going to look a bit more like that  
it's obviously little bit there's a little bit of 
a trend there a little bit of a curve but for the  
most part our is a bit more linear and that's 
simply because we're not getting raised very  
much we don't have to fear the raise we don't have 
to worry about what do we do against a check Jam  
we're just able to bet a lot more linearly and as 
you can see almost any second pair now is a pure  
value bet we're betting 2/3 pot here with almost 
any 10x 107 109 108 although 108 is checking a  
fair amount depending on the combo but we're even 
betting for value with eights sevens sixes fives  
cuz those hands well fives is is a set actually 
so forget about fives but we're betting eights  
sevens and sixes here and we're getting value 
from worse hands we're getting call by any pair  
remember so we just have to be very very willing 
to Value bet super thinly in this spot this is the  
essence of these situations most of you if you 
are having trouble against these very passive  
players it's probably going to be because you're 
not appropriately adjusting your value ranges it's  
not possible for someone to be drastically under 
underfolding but also doing it with the right  
range of hands they have to be underfolding with 
specifically hands that are too weak to continue  
and that's what allows us here to get value from 
stuff like a 10 Queen 10 109 stuff like that we're  
going for Value every time here with stuff like 
Jack n jack8 even Jack s is kind of close Jack S  
A Hearts looks like it wants to check back here 
but we're really getting a ton of value from a  
lot of these hands and we're continuing to go for 
it with a lot of our drawers we're betting most of  
our combo drawers here most of our flush drawers 
most of our open Enders we're not checking that  
many of them we're just realizing Equity a lot 
of the time here because we get cold and then we  
see a river or we simply get a fold and we take 
the pot down right now this is the first part of  
the equation that we're betting the turn as a 
preemptive exploit here we're betting the turn  
with a much more linear range so the question was 
how does the river function what's the difference  
here and does it function the same way well let's 
take a look once Mike calls let's imagine we get  
another brick now on the river we get maybe we get 
another Deuce maybe we get the deuce of diamonds  
and we know Mike never has a full house cuz he 
always raises two pair Plus on the turn now it  
does want villain to lead out at some frequency 
it does want Mike to lead in this spot but let's  
assume that that's not going to happen let's 
actually get rid of his option to lead here  
because realistically probably pretty unlikely 
that he's going to find some of these weird  
Bluffs um or probably pretty unlikely he's going 
to find some of these blocker Bets with a Jack or  
anything like that so we're just going to have him 
check everything and now uh with about a 2/3 pot  
bet behind we actually have a very simple River 
strategy we're going for Pure value with every top  
pair plus right on a brick River we are jamming 
every single Jack or better it's clearly strong  
enough to bet here and we're also bluffing with 
pretty much all of our King High or Worse except  
for king queen specifically and a little bit of 
King n that we're checking back cuz we do have  
a tiny bit of Showdown value with those hands but 
in fact it's actually a very very simple strategy  
to execute here on a brick it's not difficult 
at all to employ this approach we can establish  
very clearly that Jack X is our value threshold 
we're betting everything Jack X or better and we  
are bluffing with pretty much everything king9 or 
worse and that's a really clear an easy blueprint  
and rubric that we can follow here not going to 
be difficult to employ that strategy we have no  
reason to bet 40% here because there's nothing in 
this range that has incentive to do that however  
even if we were to just get rid of that 40% here 
just for Simplicity what we will see when we come  
to look at Mike's Bluff catching protocols is that 
we might have to make some adaptations based on  
what he actually does on this River so this is 
a retroactive exploit on the River of this very  
straightforward polarized range where we bet all 
in for for two-thirds pot with a Jack or better  
and with Bluffs uh but we may find that we can do 
some preemptive exploiting here which we'll talk  
about in a second so to draw some conclusions here 
we saw that betting the turn linearly worked very  
well for us given that we can preemptively assume 
Mike is going to play the turn very passively we  
got a lot of thin value from our second pair hands 
here we weren't as Polar as we usually would be  
and from there the the river is actually going 
to function fairly simply we're mostly going to  
be able to go full value on a lot of brick runouts 
with top pair plus and on some non- brick runouts  
there is going to be some Nuance there but the 
fact that we are betting the turn fairly linearly  
is going to mean that for the most part on the 
non- Brick runouts we're still going to retain a  
lot of the draws that get there we obviously bet 
for value with those draws we have certain other  
hands that are going to usually be MISD draws that 
are going to be able to Bluff so in general our  
range selection processes are not going to be that 
much more complicated on bricks the general idea  
here is we're going linear on the turn and then 
as we move into the river the same principles are  
going to apply it's going to be very difficult for 
villain to defend on the river and as a result uh  
we're going to be able to employ these polarized 
River strategies in a fairly simple Way the final  
question for us to answer here when it comes to 
Mike's tendency to underfold is going to be what  
if he doesn't fold his bluff catches what if we 
get to the river it's a brick run out and he just  
simply refuses to fold anything that catches 
Bluffs well you might imagine that the result  
here might be a little bit self-explanatory that 
it might be a little bit simple but let's check in  
just in case okay so this is our spot that we were 
just looking at where we had that linear turn bet  
and we are then arriving at the river with this 
Deuce of diamonds brick and obviously both players  
have some Mis draws here both players have some 
decently strong hands but clearly we have a lot  
more strong hands than Mike does so let's take 
a look at what happens if Mike doesn't fold his  
bluff catchers we're going to go with this 2/3 pot 
all in range here this is the reason why I used 50  
big blinds because we're shoving the river for 
not that big of a bet size and you can see that  
Mike actually does have a couple of hands that 
make trips here because he was continuing beyond  
the turn with all of his Dux but the key question 
here is what happens if he doesn't fold his bluff  
catches so to figure that out we have to establish 
which hands actually count as Bluff catches here  
now theoretically as you can see ace high is 
actually supposed to call sometimes here ace high  
as you can look at here is going to call about 
half the time because ace high actually beats a  
lot of our Bluffs but probably pretty reasonable 
that Mike won't be able to identify that ace high  
might actually be good here so we're going to 
establish his bluff catches as being anything one  
pair or better basically here so that's going to 
be threes fours sixes sevens eights Etc all that  
stuff 10x Jacka Etc but he's going to fold his Ace 
highs he's going to fold Ace queen stuff like that  
so let's lock that in there uh this hopefully 
should be pretty easy once again the way I do  
these node locks is just put everything on fold 
and then just simply go to the hand categories  
we go trips top pair second pair third pair oops 
second pair didn't go there we go low pair and  
that is it right there so we're betting the river 
for 2/3 pot to finalize it we hit lock all once  
again and everything is in place in fact what's 
interesting here is that some of these hands  
are weak enough that he's actually calling with 
some of these trash hands right you can see there  
that he's calling you know decent chunk of his 
hands that are actually pretty weak he's calling  
two-thirds of the time folding the rest here and 
our strategy is going to shape up as follows take  
a look at that what do you notice hopefully if you 
just take a few seconds to look at this breakdown  
the outcome is becoming fairly apparent here we're 
not bluffing we're not bluffing at all we have no  
Bluffs whatsoever and not only that but take a 
look at 10x we're now jamming all of our 10x for  
Value 107 109 108 Etc there are simply so many 
hands that we beat that a hand like 107 if we  
look at the equity here 107 at this point has 68% 
equity and that is a very strong hand it's a hand  
that's strong enough to get called by worse at a 
decent rate so even if we are running into a deuce  
occasionally here because Mike can call the turn 
with any Deuce even if we're running into a jack  
we're getting enough value that we can jam 10x 
and EV wise it's not going to be especially close  
if we look at things EV wise here even though 
there is a fairly close margin between jamming  
and checking 10x is simply winning the pot such a 
high rate here that we're actually making 29 big  
blinds one way or the other so it's not mandatory 
to jam a 10 here but take a look at something like  
a Jack Jack seven Jack seven here there's about 
a 10 big blind difference between jamming and  
checking so the really important thing to identify 
here is it's not about really finding some kind of  
Bluffs here we don't have to have Bluffs as we 
saw Mike is underfolding to our River aggression  
so it's not important that we find Bluffs what is 
important is that we have to jam a jack for Value  
if you check back with a jack here you're missing 
so much value from these passive players and a lot  
of you that might be having trouble here could 
be having trouble because you're not jamming a  
jack for Value in this spot so very important 
to recognize how how strong a Jack is in this  
situation conversely part of the reason why we're 
not bluffing with certain hands is take a look at  
something like Ace 3 Ace 3 of diamonds let's say 
which is a busted gut shot here we missed the gut  
shot on the turn this hand is not bluffing not 
not only because Mike is underfolding here and  
the bluff is losing four big blinds but we win 
13 big blinds or so by checking here with ace3  
of diamonds because we have good Showdown value 
we win this pop quite a bit even Queen six here  
Queen six of Hearts Queen six of clubs we're 
winning about seven and a half big blinds or  
more by checking down because Mike's range is 
so weak that we don't need to Bluff with Queen  
High anymore in fact even 76 even seven High here 
is actually capturing one big blind from this pot  
because sometimes Mike just has four three of 
Spades or something like that and we actually  
win with seven high so that's another reason why 
we're not bluffing here it's not just because Mike  
refuses to fold it's because the hands that would 
usually Bluff because they have no Showdown value  
now have some Showdown value they have some Equity 
they win the part a small frequency the time at  
Showdown and it becomes very important to make 
sure that we capture that by just checking and  
taking that small portion of the pot here instead 
of turning our King highs Our Queen highs into a  
bluff and not only making an unprofitable Bluff 
but also wasting the opportunity to just check  
and realize that Equity that we do have especially 
hands like Ace King here I mean Ace King is making  
14 big blinds checking back right so we absolutely 
don't want to miss those check backs the same way  
we don't want to miss those value bets so that 
kind of sums it up for this River spot let's  
bring it back around and draw some conclusions 
so to summarize our approach here we have to be  
very willing to Value bet thinley on the river 
a 10 in this spot on Jack 105 du Duce would be a  
very good value candidate and we really don't have 
very much need to Bluff anymore if we're going to  
find our opponent underfolding it's going to turn 
our break even Bluff candidates into losing Bluff  
candidates and crucially our Bluff candidates 
are also going to have some Showdown value here  
a lot of our King highs and queen highs on this 
brick River are actually going to sometimes win  
and we don't want to waste that Showdown value by 
betting in a potentially unprofitable spot when we  
might actually be able to capture 5 10 15% of the 
part even by simply checking and hoping that Mike  
happens to have a worst draw that missed so that's 
a very important concept to keep in mind so with  
that said let's draw some overall conclusions 
from this video about how we're going to crush  
Mike and players like Mike going forward our EV 
versus these passive players is going to come  
from growing pots without our value hands it's 
going to come from linear range construction  
where we're betting our strongest hands our 
strongest drawers we're going for thin value in  
a lot of spots we're not going as Polar and we're 
recognizing that they're going to continue with a  
lot of hands that don't have enough equity which 
means that larger early Street sizings are going  
to be very effective especially in situations 
where they're very inelastic to our size but when  
they do raise or show some kind of aggression we 
have to be very very tight we have to be folding  
some pretty big hands and mostly just continuing 
with stuff that's actually live against the value  
portions of their range because their range is 
going to be mostly value and we don't want to  
be trying to Bluff catch against those ranges 
finally we don't really have to Bluff Rivers  
against them very much especially when our Bluffs 
sometimes win now if we did find a spot where a  
particular player was continuing to the river a 
lot and then folding or perhaps on some of those  
River cards that are not complete bricks like 
that Deuce that we looked at the opposite cards  
like a nine a an eight for example something like 
that those cards we might still have some Bluffs  
especially if we think that maybe they're going 
to be a bit more likely to fold some of the peir  
hands that get to that point but when rivers 
brick off and our Bluffs have some Equity to  
win at Showdown we we really don't often have to 
Bluff Rivers against these players especially if  
we just simply don't think they're going to fold 
so that's a really crucial adaptation to make as  
well in general you're going to find a lot of 
these players at all stake levels even up to  
high stakes these players do exist obviously 
Mike is a pretty extreme example we saw he was  
really unwilling to fold any of those gut shots 
or any Equity at all but this General principle  
of linear Equity growing pots on early streets 
that's going to be very useful against all of  
these passive opponents that you're going to come 
up against so keep that in mind going forward if
