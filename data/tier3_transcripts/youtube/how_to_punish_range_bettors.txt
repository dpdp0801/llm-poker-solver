### TOPIC: how to punish range bettors
hey everyone what's up this is Uri for GTO 
Wizard and in this video I'm going to show  
you how to crush people who range bet small but 
let's get into it [Music] so the key to beating  
any strategy is first of all to understand 
it and in order to understand the strategy  
of range betting small I'm going to ask you a 
simple question and that's you know if we're  
optimizing for a hand group say either big hands 
like ace8 or ace king on this board ace8 deuce or  
medium to small hands like pocket 9 pocket sixes 
king queen high which type of hands do you think  
the small bet optimizes for and the answer to 
this is very clearly the small hands right ace  
king and ace8 they want big pots i want to bet 
big something like nines would really kind of  
appreciate a smaller bet size so the first key 
bit to understand about the small bet strategy  
is that it's centered around small hands and in 
poker a lot of the the dance is how do I get a  
lot of money in with my big hands without leaving 
my little hands too face up so they get run over  
and one way to do this is just chunking everything 
together so betting everything here I forced the  
solver to bet everything and once your opponent 
calls and you get a turn card you now separate  
your range into two bits which I'll show you guys 
how to do and and it's very very straightforward  
and very particular to this kind of strategy where 
after the small flaw bet now anything like nines  
or a pair of eights or sevens there's a very 
clear-cut differentiation now we bet this is  
called a polarized bet so very very bigger check 
and all our medium strength hands get to the river  
so this is the idea of a small bet strategy now 
how do you beat people once you understand this  
idea there are actually a few different segments 
to beating and a few different types of mistakes  
that you might be making uh mistake number one 
is folding too much uh when your opponent bets  
small it's very important that you're aware of a 
concept called backdoor equity or backdoor draws  
just continuing with pairs and draws and maybe 
high card hands isn't enough and I'll show you  
guys this quickly on the solver where you can 
see a hand like pen n just continuing on a deuce  
rainbow this is three to a straight jack 10 is 
almost three to a straight but it it can make  
shots on both ends a hand like 97 is always 
continuing a hand like 67 can continue in a  
hand like 65 can even continue and this is due to 
the backdoor equity so these these hands can turn  
draws similarly all sorts of hands with backdoor 
flush draws even as weak as 95 suited or 74 suited  
get to continue versus a small bet now if you're 
not aware that you can continue with these types  
of hands there's a very high likelihood these 
small bets are running you over so first step  
to countering the small bets is to continue with 
a wide calling range second step to continuing  
versus a small bet is your raising range now I 
already said this is meant to optimize for your  
opponent's weak to medium strength hands and if 
we don't raise aggressively they get to see the  
river kind of cheap with any hand that they want 
so what the computer does to counter this is it  
has a very aggressive check raising strategy 
with both a lot of bluffs a lot of value hands  
a lot of backdoor draws not in addition to draws 
especially on these kinds of dry boards so this  
awareness of backdoor draws is important but there 
are also some hands that are not actually looking  
to put a stack in and here we would see something 
like A6 ace9 suited uh 89 suited of course pair  
of deuces is generally looking to bluff and and 
a pair of eight scisses at times too it depends  
on the runout but the idea with these hands is uh 
we can attack the weak to medium strength hands it  
doesn't have to be by putting our stack in it just 
needs to be by putting more money in with a better  
hand so something like A6 would go check race and 
then how do you play it later well just as though  
the pot is the size you got to and this is your 
hand strength so very likely check the turn and  
then maybe throw in a small value bet on the river 
of course if you turn a six things change and yeah  
that's part of the game constantly re-evaluating 
your hand so the number two thing is you want to  
be check raising aggressively including a bit 
merged and including back door draws and this  
denies your opponent the ability to see the river 
for free now I'll throw in a caveat that if you're  
going to check raise you better know how to play 
the turn and you can study this with GTO Wizard  
most hands tend to play rather intuitively but 
understanding which turn cards are good or bad  
for each player helps to manage your frequencies 
in these spots okay so third key to beating the  
guys who range bet is to recognize that 
these guys have kind of pulled the trick  
so they took their weak hands they bet them along 
with the strong hands on the flop but then once  
they checked the turn generally speaking they 
get to the river with a very weak range now the  
computer will actually check back stronger than 
most humans will but in practice most guys keep  
betting all their good hands check back you know a 
range that's very centered on threes through kings  
and 8x and king highs and the third key here is 
just to be extremely aggressive on the river um  
and here you see an example of the solver going 
for a pot-sized bet with most all pairs uh going  
for quite a few bluffs and if I were to input 
multiple sizes which I'll do right now you'll  
actually see that there's also this wide swath 
of middle pairs which are also betting small to  
punish your opponent for all the sevens and fives 
and fours and sixacks and king highs that he got  
to the river with so very wide very aggressive 
betting and the less your opponent is trapping  
the more you can actually size up these bets even 
bigger and even have over bets so the key thing  
is that you recognize that the weakness and the 
strategy is at two points number one when they bet  
the flop there are a lot of weak hands in there 
and number two once they check back the turn they  
get to the river with quite a lot of weak hands 
and these would be the pressure points where we  
we can try to take advantage of the strategy 
whereas when they bet the turn big that's just  
a very strong range and there's not much you 
can do there other than hope that you have a  
good hand and fold quite often the rest of the 
time so uh that's it for this video i hope that  
understanding the big picture idea behind range 
betting as well as three different counters to  
it is helpful for you guys i know a lot of people 
implement this strategy and encounter the strategy  
without really knowing the big picture and I 
always find that these kinds of things help so  
hope you enjoyed it like and subscribe to the
