### TOPIC: how to use equity buckets in poker
hey everyone and welcome in this video 
I'm going to explain how to use equity  
buckets to better understand flop strategies if 
you're looking to better your understanding of  
Game Theory and fundamentals this 
is going to be the video for you
first off we're going to take a look at two 
examples that will better illustrate how to  
use equity buckets in flop strategies we're 
going to open up Wizard and go to the study tab
from here we're going to select two 
different scenarios from the same positions  
first we open under the gun and call 
the big blinds you can use any flop  
that you're looking to study for this example 
I'm going to use Ace Jack 10 for the first one
and we're going to take a look at the 
equity buckets for this particular flop  
so to find the equity buckets 
you're going to go to the ranges tab  
and in the middle here you'll 
see a section for Equity buckets  
to explain what Equity buckets are you can go to 
the the drop down here and click the help Equity  
buckets are essentially hands that are separated 
by their Equity into categories so we have best  
hands good hands weak hands and trash hands trash 
ends are going to be any hands that have an equity  
threshold of zero to thirty three percent weekends 
are going to be 33 to 50 percent good hands are  
going to be 50 to 75 percent and best hands are 
going to be 75 to 100 percent so when people are  
talking about best hands Advantage they're 
talking about how much Equity our range has  
with a certain category of hands so our best hands 
are going to be in that 75 to 100 Equity category  
now how do we use these to help better understand 
flop strategies let's get into the first example
the first thing I like to do when studying a 
scenario is to look at the two different ranges  
and how they interact with the board 
so we can do that with the ranges tab  
you'll see here that on each side we have the 
under the gun position and the big blind position  
as the original razor we can typically understand 
that we're going to have a lot of strong hands  
some of these hands are not going to be in big 
blind's range immediately that draws my attention  
because this is a flop with high cards so if under 
the gun is going to have a strong range of high  
cards I'm going to assume that it's going to be 
the stronger range we can confirm this by looking  
into the equity buckets you can see here that the 
best hands if I click here will display the best  
hands in the category and it shows that the under 
the gun range in fact has 39.4 percent of best  
hands compared to the big blinds of 4.6 percent so 
that's a very small number of best hands for the  
big blind and it makes a lot of sense as I've 
mentioned before it does lack a lot of strong  
combos like Aces and kings ace king and a lot 
of Ace queen offsuit as well as Ace Queen Suited  
so whenever you have a range that is going to have 
more strong combinations than another the solver  
is going to want to bet at a higher frequency in 
this case it's so drastic that the solver likes to  
bet the entire range now this isn't only because 
of the best hands range but also because of the  
weekends and the trash ends so if we look at the 
weekends and trash ends the under the gun position  
doesn't really have too many of these combos 
compared to the big blind the big blind is going  
to have a lot of weekends and trash hands as we 
can see here so in combination with the best hands  
advantage and the lack of weak and trash hands we 
see the solver wants to bet at a high frequency  
because the entire range is going to interact 
with this board very well and instead of trying to  
balance a really large sizing and a small sizing 
it makes more sense to group the strategy into a  
sizing that the entire range doesn't mind betting 
so when we're looking at the strategy it's often  
going to be reflected by how the entire range 
wants to continue sometimes there's going to  
be a hybrid of these categories sometimes you'll 
have some best hands uh some good hands weekends  
and trash hands and the solver wants to split 
depending on the board texture because of how  
the opponent interacts with the board as well 
and in this case because the opponent does not  
interact with the board whale and we interact with 
the board very well the solver wants to bet at a  
high frequency this is going to change depending 
on the board texture so let's use another example
let's try something around the 765 range now 
this is going to hit the big blind much better  
than the previous Board of Ace Jack 10 and 
we can immediately see that reflected in the  
strategy of the under the gun position after 
the big blind checks you can see the amount  
that the under the gun position wants to check 
goes way up and if we look at the equity buckets  
we're going to find the reason why so here the 
amount of good hands and weekends is increased  
in the big blinds uh scenario also the best 
hands Advantage has shrunk significantly  
previously we saw that on an ace Jack 
10 board the best hands Advantage was  
40 compared to under five and now 
it's only 13 compared to almost six  
so this Advantage has shrunk a lot as well as the 
fact that the under the gun position is not going  
to interact with a lot of this board a lot of 
our hands are going to be categorized into the  
good hands category and whenever you have a good 
to medium strength hand if you click here you can  
see that it's going to consist of a lot of hands 
that don't typically want to be betting three  
streets of value so hands like queens and Jacks 
and tens are great but the problem is compared to  
the big blinds uh strong hands they're not going 
to be able to to bet and they're not going to be  
able to bet large across those three streets so 
looking at the stronger hands from the big blinds  
you can see that they're going to have a lot of 
the straights they're going to have a lot of the  
two pairs they're going to have a lot of the sets 
whereas under the gun is going to be mixing all  
of these suited combos around here while big blind 
is going to have a lot of these suited combos that  
interact with the 765 board here so this is going 
to lead to a high frequency of checking for the  
under the gun whenever you have less of a best 
hands advantage and the overall good hands are  
high in your range it's the perfect combination 
to have a high frequency check in your strategy
so when I'm studying and comparing two ranges I 
like to use the equity buckets feature to help  
myself better understand what's going on with the 
Flop strategy typically you'll see a lot of Trends  
with the equity buckets correlating to the range 
advantage to the best hands advantage to all the  
different categories here that you'll see they're 
going to affect your flop strategy and you can  
always go back and forth between the strategy and 
the ranges and the equity buckets to see where the  
trends lie and that's one of the most important 
things that you can do when you're studying using  
GTO wizard is to pull the heuristics out of the 
strategy so that you can apply them to any other  
situation that you might find yourself into so 
whether it's a single raised pot or if it's a  
four bed pot with the small blind and the big 
blind using the equity buckets and the strategy  
tool you can come up with an idea of what's going 
on and why why I hope you guys enjoyed this video
