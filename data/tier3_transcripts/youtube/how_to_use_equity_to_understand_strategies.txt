### TOPIC: how to use equity to understand strategies
what's up guys we at gto wizard just
released a brand new update
it's got a lot of exciting features that
are highly requested and should change
the way you study
i'm going to showcase some of these
features and go over a flop and go over
a certain formation and we're going to
show how this can change the way that
you
use gto wizard forever
[Music]
the first big feature of this update is
the equity tab
it works very similarly to the ev tab
it's basically just a
heat map of all of our different hands
in the range and how much equity each
one of those hands have
we also added this column here of the
equity column and the summary filter
that way if you're in any other tab like
the strategy tab and you
still want to be able to see how much
equity one hand has you can just tab
over to the summary tab and see
the how much equity that hand has the
next
most exciting part of this update is the
ranges tab
basically this is going to rework how we
see range versus range and how we
compare different
ranges in different positions in
different formations and whatnot
so we have the ranges side by side here
and we have all the different metrics in
the middle
basically we have the combos we have
that how much equity charing has how
much ev
each range has and then we have this new
thing called equity buckets
equity buckets are basically grouping
all of our all of the different hands in
our range
into specific equity buckets so
that's basically any hand that's between
100 and 75
is going into the best hands any hand
between 75 equity and 50
equity goes into the good hands and etc
what this allows us to do is break down
each different equity bucket and see how
much
um each range has so we're able to
compare okay so the button has 26.1
percent of best hands and the big blind
only has 13.1 percent
and then we can go down to the trash
hands the big blind has 30.9 percent of
trash hands the button has 15.1 percent
of trash hands
obviously the button has a pretty huge
advantage on this board it's also
also shown by the equity at 57 whereas
the big blind only has 43
the next way to compare ranges that
we've added is this equity graph
and so for anyone who isn't familiar
with equity graphs
basically the x-axis is all all the
combos
putting on and then the y-axis is all
the different equity
for the for those combos so the bottom
bottom left here
is the worst hands and the top top right
here is the best hands
so as we go down the line we just get
lower and lower equity
as we hover over it we also see this
specific combo and specific amount of
equity for that combo
there are also a number of different
filters that we can add in this
so we can filter by these equity buckets
if you click on it
so we can see best hands and then this
updates how
the overall betting strategies work here
we can also filter by these different
like
sets two pair over pair top pair and we
can see who has more top pair plus and
so
if we go up here we have this 19.8
percent 19.8 percent of the buttons
range is top pair plus whereas only
fourteen point three percent of the
big blinds range is top pair plus
another cool feature here
is being able to filter something on
this tab and be able to say okay
let's see what the best hands do but we
also want to see the strategy of the
best hand so we can go over to this
strategy tab
and see okay so for our best hands how
are
each different specific combo what is
its betting frequency what is its
checking frequency
and then finally um all of these
different things
work as well on mobile that this every
feature i've set here is completely
interactive with with the mobile apps as
well and so if you
are on the go or need a quick a quick
solve you can pull it up on your phone
so now i'm going to try to showcase how
we can use these new features
in order to actually lend money in poker
and the best way we can do this is
by using these new equity features we
can start to further understand how
we choose bet sizes and so here if we go
back over this is king jack 2 rainbow
button versus big blind singer is pot
and so a very standard spot
and so as we look at the strategy tab we
can see we're betting at a really high
frequency
betting 74 of the time and mostly for a
small size however we do use a little
bit of this
larger size and so when we go back and
look at this equity graph we can see
that we are allowed to bet this very
very very high frequency
because we have this very large equity
advantage
and so when we look over at the at
the overall betting range we basically
bet every single
hand at some frequency so if we go and
look at even the trash hands we can see
even the trash hands are able to bet
this
simply because the big blind has to
respect
this massive advantage that we have here
and so what's very interesting is once
we bet this 27 percent and then the big
blind
the big blind calls let's go to a turn
i'm gonna choose a brick turn with the
six of spades
the kind of turn that won't change a lot
there won't be any draws that are
completed and whatnot
and so now we can actually start to
compare how the ranges interact now
versus how they were on the flop and so
here now we can actually see the big
blind starts to have an advantage at
this low end hand even up to about 45
equity the big blind has more hands here
and then up here big line is still
at an advantage whereas the
top-end hands the button starts to is
still uncapped so the button still has
an advantage at the top end hands but as
we see the big blind is actually in much
better shape now than he was on the flop
and we can also see this by the equity
now the big the big blind
actually has an equity advantage and so
that's an interesting thing
why did that happen so if we go back we
were in and remember that the
button is betting all of these very
very low equity hands these hands like
nine six suited and eight six suited and
eight five suited
whereas when the big blind calls his bet
all of those same hands are end up
folding as well
all these all these very trash hands end
up folding
on almost none of these end up calling
some of them will bluff raise
but for the most part the big blind's
lowest equity hands folded
whereas the buttons lowest equity hands
are still in the buttons range they
ended up betting
and so now when we skip over back to the
turn that is how we end up with this
advantage at these top end of the range
because
or at the low end of the range because
the big blind still has all of these
very low equity hands in its range
however the button has the button also
gets to have this this
uncapped range because he has hands like
kings he has hands like jacks whereas
the big blind isn't going to have any of
those
and so if we look at if we actually
start looking at how the strategy for
the button is going to be betting here
the button is going to be mainly over
betting or checking and so
that is as a result of the button not
having an advantage at this lower end of
the range
and so now the button has to respect the
big blinds advantage
and so the when the button uses this
over bet he can basically cancel out
this entire advantage for the big blind
because all of these lower equity hands
have to fold
if we filter by the over bet range we
see it's an extremely polar strategy
we see that the best hands are betting
this at 47.1 percent of the
of the over betting range our best hands
while 47 are the trash hands basically
what that tells you
none of these marginal hands are going
to be put into this over bet range
they're going to end up being checked
but when we look at the strategy of this
it's all these high equity hands we can
see
that the the best hands here are hands
like kings hands like jacks
are being put into this range and so
it's an extremely polar range whereas
when we look at the good hands and the
weak hands
strategy is almost purely checking and
this is just because many of these hands
have really good showdown value hands
hands like ace jack really get to win
just a ton and if we look at the
equity of ice track it's when it's 73
equity
h jack is just going to check back the
turn and be able to win a ton
and so this is a very quick synopsis of
how we can actually use
these filters and use this equity graph
in order to
start to understand betting ranges start
to understand bet frequencies
and just quickly understand how the
ranges interact
