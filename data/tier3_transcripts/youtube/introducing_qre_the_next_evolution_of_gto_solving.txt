### TOPIC: introducing qre the next evolution of gto solving
[Music] the first commercial GTO solvers 
appeared on the market in 2015 and for the  
last decade Nash equilibrium has reign 
supreme as the gold standard of optimal  
poker strategy today we challenge that 
paradigm introducing quantal response  
equilibrium a groundbreaking new approach 
for solving optimal poker qre represents  
the next evolution of GTO solving and will soon 
become the state-of-the-art let me show you why
this is the Nash equilibrium strategy for 
a 30-bit blind heads up pot everything is  
optimized and finally balanced like the gears 
of a Swiss watch but what happens when your  
opponent takes that Swiss watch and smashes it 
into the ground what happens when they take a  
move that has a 0% frequency representing no hands 
whatsoever this is what happens a ghost line this  
is the fundamental problem with Nash equilibrium 
solvers is that they have very poor responses to  
nodes that aren't supposed to happen so what's 
going on here why is the solver calling 106  
and folding Ace9 what is this ridiculous strategy 
well what you're looking at is essentially a node  
in the game tree that has not converged the solver 
has not finished solving the strategy here you see  
very early on in the solving process small blind 
figured out hey I never have to shove here and as  
soon as that happened big blind stopped improving 
their response to the shove what we're left with  
is this barely converge strategy now here's the 
issue in reality your opponents will take non GTO  
lines in reality your opponents might just open 
shove here and it would be nice if we had a good  
strategy against that without having to node lock 
or force small blind to take some strategy without  
assuming what their range ought to look like that 
is the problem that quantile response equilibrium  
solves now I'll solve this spot using GTO wizard 
AI which uses quant response automatically you'll  
note that anytime you're doing any sort of custom 
solving from now on it's going to use QRE whereas  
the default solutions the pre-sold spots will 
continue to use Nash so I'll load up the quantal  
response equilibrium and the first thing you'll 
notice is that it looks basically the same in  
spots that are common in regular spots where QRE 
differs from Nash are in the uncommon spots in  
the ghost lines so when small blind shoves here 
instead of getting noise we get a nicely converged  
solution where every hand that calls is a plus 
call in addition if I click the ranges tab I can  
actually see what small blinds range ought to look 
like apparently it's a lot of vulnerable pocket  
pairs strong ASEXs and some trash with halfdeent 
blockers kind of what you might expect the range  
to look like in this spot now I didn't tell small 
blind that it should use this range where did this  
come from right i didn't know lock this i didn't 
force it to bet it came up with this on its own  
so how does QR determine what range to use in 
these ghost notes and what else is new in this  
update that affects you as a poker player stick 
around to find out nash equilibrium is ubiquitous  
with game theory optimal poker every professional 
player in the world knows what Nash equilibrium  
is so they're probably going to be confused as to 
why we're moving away from such a wellestablished  
principle but I think by the end of this video you 
will not only agree with us but you will welcome  
quantal response equilibrium as the next iteration 
of GTO strategies in this video I'm going to  
cover an introduction to QRE we'll cover its key 
benefits to you as a poker player we'll do some  
strategy comparisons before with Nash after with 
QRE we'll cover the benchmarks and just measure  
how well it performs and lastly for the nerds 
in the audience I'll go through a technical  
explanation about how QRE works on the back end 
okay let's get into it so what spots does this  
affect well going forward any spot you solve with 
GTO Wizard AI that is to say any custom solution  
now uses quant response equilibrium any pre-solved 
solutions that means spots solved as part of our  
pre-existing library of solutions still use Nash 
so those were solved before those haven't changed  
now if you want to custom solve a spot in GT 
Wizard you need an elite subscription however  
you can still try QRE for free by solving queen 
of spades 10 of spades seven of hearts this is  
the free flop we give out to people who would like 
to try before they buy one of the key shortcomings  
with Nash equilibrium is how it handles ghostlines 
you see a Nash strategy assumes that players never  
make mistakes it assumes people are perfectly 
rational and no one's ever going to take a non  
GTO action and so as a result it only optimizes 
your strategy in spots that are quote unquote  
supposed to happen in GTO but what about non 
GTO spots what happens when your opponent takes  
some ghost line some 0% frequency line well your 
strategy facing those ghost lines is suboptimal  
because they never happen in GTO and therefore it 
has not converged in the solver the problem here  
is a lack of a defined range if a player takes 
some action that represents nothing what's the  
best response against their nothing range how do 
you fight a ghost that's what quantal response  
equilibrium seeks to solve quri intentionally 
introduces mistakes into the solution at a low  
frequency and this allows it to optimize the 
strategy everywhere even in lines that aren't  
supposed to happen and to be clear it gives the 
same output as Nash in normal spots but it gives  
a significantly better output against these ghost 
lines what do you mean it makes mistakes all right  
so let me be clear because when we published this 
people were a little confused about what we meant  
by this when I say it makes mistakes I'm saying 
it is intentionally taking a minus AV action a  
fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a percent 
we're talking very very small amounts here so much  
so that they are essentially negligible when it 
comes to the accuracy of your strategy now the way  
we introduce mistakes is really cool you see it's 
done rationally in such a way that the larger the  
EV loss the less likely the mistake is to happen 
so mistakes that lose a lot of EV barely ever  
happen mistakes that lose less EV are more likely 
to happen and the result of this is that you can  
actually go and see what the range would look like 
and they kind of align with your intuition about  
like what you think their range might look like 
in this spot now to be clear the goal of QRE is  
not to model some donkey behavior the goal is to 
create a highly accurate strategy that is as good  
as an ash equilibrium by introducing the minimum 
amount of mistakes of the minimum pertubation  
needed in order to get good responses against 
ghost lines some of you will be asking about how  
accurate the strategy is well we've benched this 
and I'll get more into the benchmarks later but  
the exploitability is about 0.1% of the pot on 
average per street so it's pretty darn accurate  
to be clear guys we did not invent QR quantal 
response equilibrium was first published about  
in 1995 and since then it's been used in a wide 
array of fields like economics political science  
and behavioral analysis qre is essentially just a 
better model of human behavior because well let's  
face it we're somewhat irrational creatures aren't 
we what is new is applying QRE to poker gto Wizard  
AI is the very first poker solver to employ quant 
response equilibrium let's get down to brass tax  
how does this help me as a poker player and there 
are a number of key benefits so because quantal  
response equilibrium handles these ghost lines 
better it's going to capture more EV against real  
world mistakes without nodlocking to be clear you 
can node lock but you don't need to all of that  
is kind of captured within the rationality 
premise of QRE and because of this feature  
it's going to outperform Nash equilibrium against 
imperfect opponents imperfect opponents sometimes  
take non-GTO lines and well frankly all of your 
opponents are at least a little bit imperfect so  
that leads to better real world results another 
cool benefit is that you can see what rational  
mistakes look like and learn how to punish them 
and I'll show you guys how to do that in just a  
minute here it also leads to a better training 
experience in a regular GTO solver if you take  
someone that's not supposed to happen the solver 
just has no idea what to do it looks at you and  
how did you get here with ace queen man i don't 
it's not a line i don't know what to do quantal  
response on the other hand knows what to do it has 
some well- definfined strategy even in these ghost  
lines qre also tends to lead to faster solve times 
on large complicated game trees so if you're the  
type of person that likes to solve with a bunch of 
different bet sizes at the same time QR is going  
to be for you in general we've improved our neural 
network architecture to lead to sharper less  
exploitable strategies on earlier straits so it's 
about 25% less exploitable and we'll cover that in  
our benchmarks lastly the actual motivation behind 
cury is that it has this uh special quality of  
being like pertubation stable so you can kind of 
poke at the equilibrium and it's still going to be  
stable even in wildly complicated like multi-way 
spots where there's many different equilibriums  
to be honest guys I might be butchering this last 
explanation a bit because I don't understand it  
i'm not an engineer but suffice it to say our 
geniuses in the engine team seem very excited  
about the the use cases of CER and it seems to be 
a crucial ingredient for a bunch of like really  
cool upgrades we want to do in the future so CURE 
is going to act as kind of a crucial ingredient  
for multi-way solving and for a bunch of other 
stuff we want to add so hang in there because  
2025 is going to be a really exciting year let 
me give you a real world example seven months  
ago somebody posted this to the r/poker theory 
subreddit can't get GTO Wizard to give me an  
answer villain limp called a 4x phrase heads up 
they called a 70% bet then versus my check he  
rips it in i can't remotely figure it out what 
to do in these spots and GTO Wizard AI refuses  
to balance a realistic range so he's sitting here 
with king jack facing this 4x over bet on a flush  
completing turn thinking well what the hell am 
I supposed to do here and in the past there just  
wasn't a good solution to this because either you 
have to nod lock the opponent's strategy like you  
have to assume what they're shoving here or you 
have to just go into some ghost line and to this  
user remember I replied this was before quant 
response came out I said yeah this is going to  
be a problem with any solver to be honest the 
issue is the turn jam just does not happen in  
GTO and even if it's the only size available 
the solver would rather just check in the spot  
rather than go in forex the pot so essentially 
this means that the strategy facing the shove  
doesn't converge since this line is discarded so 
early in the holding process the class of game  
theory that deals with this is called trembling 
hand equilibria and it's not a thing with modern  
solvers here are some workarounds so I tried to 
give it the best answer that I could give you know  
knowing the limitations of the software at the 
time but now we actually have a proper solution  
to this so let me first show you what the Nash 
response looks like to this shove here we have a  
heads up spot and I'll walk you through the line 
so villain in the small blind calls we raise 4x  
they call flop is king jack deuce okay now here 
they bet 75% this is a spot where the solver like  
will mix between over bets and small bets mostly 
leaning towards small bets but okay 75 is not the  
most commonly used size here but whatever we bet 
this size they call turn is the seven of spades  
completing the spade draw here they're holding 
king jack they check and villain just rips it all  
in 450% pot it may come as a surprise to you that 
betting 450% of the pot is not an ideal strategy  
in this spot in fact when they shove here they 
have no hands so selected line is rarely used in  
GTO solution may be inaccurate we get this error 
right and if we go into what our opponent's range  
looks like we can see it is nothing so what is 
the best response against a nothing range well  
what we end up with is a strategy that's not very 
well converged first of all if I go look at the  
equity it says everything is 50% you know it's 
like the old saying goes it's either 50/50 he  
either he has it or he doesn't what are you 
going to do you know this is just a like an  
error based on the fact that small blind has 
no range in this spot furthermore it's just  
not a very good strategy like we're folding some 
flushes okay that's a little odd and then if we  
go look at the the two pair like you'd think if 
you have let's say the jack of spades you should  
call a little bit more often than let's say jack 
deuce maybe if you have let's say top pair and you  
have like the ace of spades like you would think 
this hand should pure call right or at least call  
more than the other top pair hands but again 
this spot just hasn't converged because small  
blind shouldn't be shoving here at all okay so 
this is the Nash response and it's not very good  
now let's go over to the quantal response and here 
again they should not be shoving right they just  
shouldn't shove at all this one is actually a much 
better strategy first of all we're not folding a  
flush facing this size right um and then if we 
take a look and compare let's say two pair we can  
see things like if you have the jack of spades you 
should call more than without and if we go over to  
like let's say top pair you can see that ace king 
with the ace of spades should call more than ace  
king without the ace of spades right like really 
obvious kind of like this is the first thing you  
would think of solutions to this spot we can also 
see that there's equity and expected value and so  
everything is nicely converged in this spot 
despite the fact that small blind should not  
be shoving here we still get a nice response to 
it and we can go and look at what their perceived  
range ought to look like so if I click ranges 
here we can actually see okay what are they  
supposed to be shoving here if they were to shove 
even though shoving is bad like even though this  
is like a bad strategy if they were to do it how 
should they do it and this is what it came up with  
so on the right hand side we can see it's shoving 
with bottom set pocket twos which is kind of an  
interesting one because like okay you're going to 
get called by a lot of flushes but you have outs  
against those flushes that call you pocket threes 
which is just a bluff and then if we go into here  
we can see like 30% flushes 16% sets and then 
for bluffs we've got stuff like uh queen nine  
with a spade so this is a combo draw and then 
like a whole lot of flushes at the top so we've  
got kind of like a realistic strategy that they're 
shoving with right and this is kind of the benefit  
of QRE it's not just that we get good responses 
against ghost lines it's that we can kind of see  
what the mistaken strategy ought to be next I'd 
like to show you what happens in a trainer so  
here's a hand that was played horribly right and 
you can see that in this spot the Nash equilibrium  
strategy is question mark it has no idea what 
to do the answer is not available because well  
small blind is never supposed to arrive at this 
spot with ace queen now in the exact same spot  
in quantal response equilibrium even though it's 
not really supposed to get you like this there  
is a well-con converged correct answer it is just 
supposed to ship it right even though you can see  
like it never takes this so on the side we can see 
bet 25% equals 0% of the time we're never supposed  
to take this action there is still a well-con 
converged strategy for it let's talk benchmarks  
so I've shown you the strategy comparisons i've 
explained to you what QRE is but realistically we  
just need to measure how good it is right we just 
need to put it under the microscope and get some  
numbers and the numbers were good so we're looking 
at a 25% more accurate strategy by which I mean  
it is 25% less exploitable on the flop compared 
to our last algorithm it is three times faster  
in big complicated pots and it is 38 times better 
if you consider a metric that uses equal weighted  
decisions and I'll get to that in just a second 
here we'll start with the flop exploitability  
this is kind of our standard method for benching 
our solver and you can see different iterations of  
our solver over the last couple years 2023 24 25 
it's been getting better and better and our latest  
iteration is a pretty big step up so right now it 
solves to an accuracy of about 0.12% of the pot  
give or take 06% so it's really good and again 
to be clear this isn't an inherent advantage of  
quantal response equilibrium it's just thanks 
to upgrades to our architecture in general  
but to anyone who's worried that introducing you 
know a tiny amount of mistakes into the strategy  
will make it too exploitable here i'm hoping I 
can convince you that that is not the case it  
is an extremely accurate algorithm another way to 
bench how good the solver is is to figure out how  
quickly it solves different spots so we solved 
a bunch of different spots and we measured the  
average solving time in seconds as well as the 
maximum solving time now Nash equilibrium is  
actually a hair faster so it is 40 milliseconds 
faster on average but the human mind is barely  
capable of recognizing a 40 millisecond delay 
what actually matters is the max solving time  
in practice right qi is up to three times faster 
on the max solving time so here you can see this  
graph that's the blue line representing the 
the Nash distance and then the max solving  
time on the y- ais and we solve our rivers to 0.1% 
accuracy that's why the the line stops there but  
uh in general QRE tends to have a much lower 
max than than Nash so what this means to you  
is that you can expect much faster solutions for 
big complicated spots let's talk about measuring  
performance in ghost lines normally if you want 
to measure how good a strategy is again you  
just take the Nash distance the exploitability 
sometimes we call this the accuracy it's just  
a way of asking if you were to max exploit the 
strategy how much money could you win against  
it now the problem with this particular metric is 
that Nash distance ignores performance in low or  
no frequency lines after all if a spot is never 
supposed to happen then it has no impact on the  
performance of your strategy but in practice 
people are imperfect and they do take these  
non-GTO lines so in practice these lines do have 
a direct effect on your EV therefore it would be  
very nice if we could measure the performance 
including these nonGTO lines so we've come up  
with a new metric which the team is calling a 
tree payoff weighted loss or TPWL for short we've  
put out an explanation in the patch notes that 
goes over this in detail but in short TPWL is  
just the average EV loss if every decision were 
equally valuable so regardless of how often you  
make that decision how often you get there with 
that hand how often that note occurs how big or  
small the pot is like we we normalize by the size 
of the pot take away all of that and just treat  
every single decision as equally valuable and then 
average the EV loss of all of those decisions and  
what you end up with is a metric that measures 
every node in the game tree and what we found  
is that quantile response equilibrium is far 
more accurate on this bench so it typically  
Nash equilibrium will converge to something like 
I don't know 4% EV loss whereas QR was closer to  
zero about 38 times more accurate according to 
this so pretty darn good now that said all this  
is really measuring is it's answering the question 
how good is the quality of the strategy at each  
individual node in the game train of all possible 
decisions of course in reality the exploitability  
of your strategy is still a far more important 
metric however having low exploitability does  
not guarantee good performance in all nodes and 
if two strategies have equal Nash distance and  
one of them has a better tree payoff weighted 
loss that will outperform in the real world  
where people make mistakes okay let's get into the 
technical explanation for the nerds remaining i'm  
going to explain how it works under the hood the 
first point I'd like to make is that there are  
multiple paths to achieve perfection you say we 
often talk about GTO as if it's this uh singular  
unexploitable strategy when the truth is that 
there are a bunch of strategies that satisfy  
even very stringent accuracy requirements so 
in practice we solve to some Nash distance  
let's say.1% of the pot that's an extremely good 
accuracy but even that tiny little bit of wiggle  
room means that there's many possible strategies 
that will fit inside this circle and so what that  
means is that both a classic Nash solver as well 
as our new quant equilibrium solver land in this  
territory of nearly unexplainable strategies and 
this isn't even a new concept like I actually  
covered this in a video that's 3 years old now 
efficient studying and there I demonstrate that  
when we took three classic solvers so not AI 
but like classic old school solvers and solve  
the exact same spot with the same bet sizes 
what ends up happening is that we get three  
completely different strategies and yet all three 
strategies had the exact same exploitability exact  
same accuracy uh so there's more than one path to 
perfection guys okay now that we understand that  
let's take a look under the hood of QRE so unlike 
Nash equilibrium which is perfectly rational QR  
has some kind of irrationality to it so we know 
it makes mistakes sometimes and the way we define  
that is through some constant we call lambda 
this is the irrationality constant and the higher  
lambda the more irrational it's going to be so the 
probability of making a mistake is chosen with a  
softmax function that uses lambda as an input 
now again Nash is a perfectly rational strategy  
so with classic Nash equilibrium it is equivalent 
to here just using a uh an irrationality of zero  
right so you are perfectly rational you never 
make mistakes with QRE it does make mistakes so  
generally when we're solving we start with like a 
higher value for lambda and then we slowly anneal  
down to make fewer and fewer mistakes to be clear 
you don't really need to do that per se it just  
makes it converge a lot faster but the point is 
that we start with mistakes and then we end with  
a strategy that is nearly mistake free but while 
it was solving it remembers all those mistakes  
along the way and it knows how to respond to them 
okay so in order to help you guys understand this  
I've built this interactive calculator and this 
is going to show you how QR will actually pick an  
action probabilistically so let's say that you're 
choosing between checking and betting and you can  
check behind and just always lose let's say you 
have some like give up hand on the river or you  
can bluff and maybe bluffing is worth 5% of the 
pot so your opponent's overfolding a little bit  
now here we can see that red bet that would be 
to bluff is the preferred strategy obviously  
right and in a Nash equilibrium silver it's 
just always going to bluff 100% of the time  
right and this is simply because well it's the 
higher review strategy but with QRE we actually  
value some mistakes so we want some small amount 
of mistakes to go in there and so we end up seeing  
is that sometimes it does check and how often 
it checks depends on our irrationality parameter  
lambda now at the extreme end let's say we are 
uh extremely irrational it's just going to do  
random stuff right like there's no rhyme or reason 
it's just going to button click but as we zoom in  
let's say like a 0.1 or something it's going to 
make mistakes less and less and less often now  
in practice we're starting very very low like 
we again you don't need much irrationality in  
order for this to work so in practice we're only 
introducing mistakes at a very low frequency and  
it gets lower and lower as we solve but again 
the solver remembers how to play against those  
mistakes so even though these are slowly cooked 
out or baked out of the solution as we solve the  
memory of how to play against them remains on the 
right hand side here we've got some equations this  
is just basically describing the soft max function 
that tells you how it's picking actions and I've  
also made a Desmos chart here if you like sliders 
personally I like the stacked area charts that  
describe a strategy but if you guys want you can 
like play around with this and see how it changes  
i thought this kind of like helped me understand 
what was going on with QRE okay so you might also  
ask yourself how it works when there's more than 
two actions so I've also built this one facing a  
bet and so in this case we have three choices we 
can either fold call or raise and right now I have  
it set at 000 so we're just going to take all 
actions equally so it's perfectly split for now  
but let's say that raising is somehow profitable 
and calling is unprofitable right so in this case  
again at the extreme always going to raise because 
it's the most profitable action right and that's  
where we end up but an irrational player will 
sometimes at some frequency they're going to call  
and at some frequency they're going to fault and 
as we solve we bake out all of these imperfections  
but the solver remembers these mistakes along 
the way the these are the formulas that kind of  
describe how QRE selects some action and I've 
also got a Desmos graph for this one but look  
guys there's way more that goes into this like 
this is just uh kind of a small part of solving  
there's a whole bunch more that goes well beyond 
my expertise and more that I can explain here uh  
but I still found it helpful to kind of get a 
feeling for how cury works uh how the mistake  
probabilities work and all that so if you're like 
a spreadsheet nerd like me I thought you might  
appreciate this quantal response equilibrium is 
the natural evolution of GTO strategies while Nash  
perfects normal lines QRE optimizes every decision 
including spots that aren't supposed to happen  
to put it simply this algorithm outperforms Nash 
against opponents who make mistakes which is by  
the way all of your opponents this upgrade isn't 
just about better responses to ghost lines though  
qre is a crucial step towards solving more 
complicated spots like Multi-way and several  
other projects that our engine team is working 
on so stay tuned guys there is so much more to
come
yeah yeah yeah yeah [Music]
