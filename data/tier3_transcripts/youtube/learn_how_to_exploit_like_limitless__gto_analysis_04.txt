### TOPIC: learn how to exploit
hey guys i'm money j2k with gta wizard
and i'm back with another high stakes
hand review
this one showcases some exploitative
play from limitless who is a
professional poker player and
consistently battles in the highest
stakes games online
so let's replay the hand and put in some
analysis
all right so this hand was played at
2550 on pokerstars
starts out with tough shark rfying the
small line to
dollars and limitless three betting the
big blind with queen eight
off tough shark calls and we see a flop
flop is 984 two diamonds we have second
pair
let me list that's about 40 a pot and
tough shark calls turn is a 7 bringing
in a double flush draw
tough shark checks limitless bets about
two thirds
tough shark jams and limitless calls
here
and when we see the river tough shark
has ace queen of hearts
so this is a really interesting hand
it's
really hard to believe that queen eight
off would be a call here in theory
and so i've kind of done some research
and tried to
try to understand why limitless made
this call and
why tough shark showed up here with ace
queen of hearts it's very interesting
ann
so let's jump into gta wizard let's get
the theoretical backing and then let's
try to understand some of the
exploitative reasons limitless would
have done this
so the first thing that's noteworthy in
this hand is understanding the small
blind range
the small blind range is going to vary a
lot from player to player
and stake to stake and just
all kinds of different variations can
come up with how is the big blind
playing and whatnot so
a lot of players have very drastically
different
um strategies in the small blind some
players only rfi
some players limp at 20 frequencies some
players raise
very high frequency because the big
blind's not three betting enough there's
just all kinds of different things you
can do blind versus blind it's very hard
to understand
is which one um tough shark is actually
doing now the biggest principle here in
theory at least
is that the higher the rake the less the
limps
and at 25.50 the rake is very low so
there will be
a pretty robust limping strategy it's
really just worth noting something to
think about as you move up stakes is at
what point are you going to put in a
limping strategy
i think it adds very little ev and it
makes the game tree much more complex so
i would be
i would put it very low on the priority
list i don't limp in small blind at 200
z and 500 in l reg
so i'm not sure if i'm not sure exactly
what stake
it's worth it i know some 5 10 and 10 20
guys that still
only raise from the small blind i don't
i don't think the ev
is very drastic i think there's probably
some exploitative bb to be gained
but really i think this should be pretty
low on the priority list i think
there is ev to be gained but i think
it's a pretty small amount so
here we have some a very low frequency
of limps
but now the big mine's going to be three
betting a lot here big blind's gonna be
three betting a
pretty merged range there's gonna be all
kinds of different hands that are bluffs
and
this is really just to make sure that
the small blind can't just rfi his whole
range and really
just crush the big blind because you
really don't want the ar the the small
of mine be it to be able to rfi
just a ton of different hands so you
really need to make sure that you're
three betting the big blind and really
making sure that you are punishing the
small blind
from and keeping him from just
horrifying a ton so
and the last thing to note about this
hand is ace queen suited just always
four bet
and it's very strange to me that ace
queen at 25 50 was
flatted i've looked at four or five
different small blind versus big blind
solves now
and i haven't seen a single one that ace
queen was uh
call at any frequency and it's actually
a pretty
notable amount of ev loss
from going from 4.37 for the 4 bet to
4.16 for the call
is is fairly significant i think it's
it's pretty bad when you're making .21
mistakes
um point two one of the big blind
mistakes i really
don't think you're gonna want to do that
because pre-flop is so common
that these somewhat small mistakes in
terms of big blinds
happen so often that they can have some
pretty drastic effects
i wouldn't say it's a punt to flat ace
queen but
i really it's very confusing to me why
it wouldn't just be a four bet i think
any i think it's just a really good hand
it just seems like it should just be
four bet
so for whatever reason tough shark
called maybe he has different solves
maybe it's some kind of exploit maybe
he's
not a reg i think from the way lemonlist
played this hand
i don't think limitless thinks he's very
good because queen eight off
is a pretty interesting call down and
we'll we'll see that going forward
but anyways when we move through we'll
go back and go up to the flop here
flop was nine eight four small mine's
just going to be checking range
here when we look at the ranges it's
just going to be
the big blinds at an advantage
especially when we look at over pairs if
we just look at over pairs
and we can see the big blind has 14.2
percent of over pairs
and the small blind only has point five
percent it's
just crushing in this part of the in in
this part of the ranges so
now it's pretty important to kind of
understand how some different board
types play and
i would say that a pretty good
simplification when you're in position
as the three better
is just to size up slightly
when you have an over pair advantage so
when you're in position
you want to slice size up to maybe 50 or
67 a pot like here we have 67
and 2 and 19 i usually simplify to just
using this like
marginal size maybe half pot maybe two
thirds just kind of depends
and i think this is pretty good simply
because
when you have this over pair advantage
you end up having a lot of hands that
have
pretty good um equity when they check
back hands like ace king
a lot of times aren't it's not really
it's kind of in a mixed spot where it
can get some value from some flush draws
but
it also just makes a lot of money when
it checks and wins at showdown and
whatnot so
you're going to have a lot of these
overcard hands that just make a lot of
money when they check so
you usually aren't going to want to like
range bet these kind of boards
but you have a pretty good advantage on
these boards so you want to bet
and because over pairs can just get a
lot of value from
hands like 9x and 8x you really can
size up another issue another reason
that over um boards that you have over
pair
advantages on end up using the slightly
larger sizes you have a lot of hands
like pocket tens and
jacks and whatnot that maybe need a
little bit of protection there's some
turn cards that could be pretty bad for
them and not only do they want
protection they also want the spr just
to get
lowered on the turn in the river so that
if one of these cards does come
the spr is so low that when it faces
aggression or
it needs um that when pocket jacks needs
to call a bet or something like that
it still can because you know maybe the
sbr is only 0.3 and it's only calling a
one-third bet so
that's pretty much one of the primary
reasons why we size up slightly when we
have an over pair advantage
if we were out of position like small
blind versus button it's pretty common
that like these
over pair advantage boards end up like
these nine high and lower boards end up
having
a a a 90 a pot size or a pot size or
sometimes even an over bet on the flop
and so
just to just to keep note you don't
really see that as much in position it
happens occasionally
but the main thing to note i would just
slice up slightly when you have no
repair advantage
um and that's that's what limitless does
he use 40 a pot we're we have 67
a pot i think the principles are going
to be pretty similar
so on the flop versus the c bet we are
going to get into our first spot that
we have some exploitative principles
coming into play
so ace queen suited is obviously not in
his pre-flop range
and so we can't understand how ace queen
suited is theoretically
supposed to play in this spot however
i tend to not look at spots like this i
tend to when i'm trying to exploit a
player
i want to understand the theoretical
under the theoretical principles of that
spot
first and then when i have a specific
read on that player i will exploit from
the theor
from the theoretical backing but i don't
want to just go straight to the
exploitative play
i think a big mistake a lot of players
make is
not is kind of ignoring the theory of a
spot and only looking
at these exploitative um these
exploitative things
i think your exploitative game will
become so much more advanced
when you understand the theoretical play
that you will gain
way more exploitative eb by
understanding the theoretical
principles of the spot and so while ace
queen suited
i really i like i said earlier i don't
think it's ever going to be a call in
any pre-flop solve
so i'm pretty sure that it's going to be
pretty difficult to find a pre-flop
solve that has ace queen suited flatting
here
but because of this this obviously
throws off our solve slightly
the problem is is we don't really know
what his actual range is
if we knew the exact frequencies of all
the different hands he has if we knew
well okay maybe he's not for betting ace
queen but he is four betting ace five a
ton and ace four a ton
maybe he's bluffing those a lot but he's
not bluffing he's or he's not raising
ace queen
maybe he's not raising jackson queens
maybe he's really nitty not forbidding a
lot at all maybe he's even flatting aces
maybe he's
we really like we just don't have enough
information here
and many times when you don't have
enough information to
make a correct exploit it's best to just
throw
to fall back on theoretical play and
just play that
so i i think that the best way that we
can analyze this
is to first understand the theoretical
play and then make some
assumptions and some some deviations
that could possibly be correct against
this specific player type
so anyways we're going to the turn
we have the seven of heart turn and
the small blind definitely is going to
have a dunk range here
and this is going to be extremely
important and probably
the pinpoint part of the hand where we
can start
understanding some exploitative
strategies so in our games
in in games where not everyone is just a
crusher
that i think it's best to take notes on
when
players donk and really attack their
check ranges
when you know that they have a donk
range so
the reason for this is a a little bit of
a toy game can explain this so if a
player only has 10 combos of value and
they're playing out of position
and they have a donk range some of that
value is going into the donk range so
we can say maybe two combos maybe maybe
maybe two combos go into the donk range
and now
his check range has eight combos and his
donk range only has two combos of value
and so obviously his check range is
weaker than if he just didn't have a
donk range because
now his check range has eight as a value
and his check range from before if he
just checked his entire range
had 10 commas of value and so what
happens when players donk
is it makes their check range weaker now
there are times in theory that that's
okay
because you're at such an advantage now
here we are
as the small blind we're at a huge
advantage we have 57 equity
we're way ahead in top end hands way
ahead in good hands we have more two
pair we have more sets we have more
straights
we're just way ahead on this board so we
are okay
with weakening our check range a little
bit because
we are just so ahead here but
most spots we aren't when we're playing
out of position and so
that's why we usually don't donk this is
a
exception to that rule now
the best thing to do when you start to
understand that this player okay this
player
is donking the best way to exploit it is
to attack his checks
with a ton of aggression because most
players especially if they're donking in
spots that aren't correct
if you see a player maybe he dunks a
flop that he's never supposed to donk
and we all know that he's not supposed
to donk
well now you know that that player at
least donks something on that flop maybe
it's all marginal hands
maybe it's all value maybe it's all
bluffs but somehow
his check range has adjusted in some way
most players i think at least in mid
stakes and and micro stakes
a lot of their donks are like weak top
pairs maybe some marginal hands maybe
some flush draws
their hands with equity they're not
total spaz hands but they're hands with
some marginal equity
i think this is going to vary
drastically from player to player so
the best things you can do is when you
see a player donk
take down what the pre-flop action was
try to understand is it a good dunk is
it a bad donk
and then two start to understand what
hands is he actually showing down with
and this is one of the best ways you can
explain especially in live poker
that a lot of live players don't even
understand what a donk is
and they just don't just willy-nilly
and they don't really care and they just
kind of go about it and they
they just uh they they don't really
think about that a player can
attack their check range very easily if
they understand
that they have a dunk range they don't
think about that and so
you could really exploit this live once
you start to play with a player and
start to understand what what he um what
he is and isn't donking
so here tough shark checks now with ace
jack of hearts we can see it
mainly donking but it is checking in 25
of the time we can we can filter for
some of his hard-ex flush draws
and we can see especially the higher
flush draws they're donking
at pretty high frequencies so it's
possible
that tough shark is not donking this
turn enough maybe he rolled low
maybe he is just not understanding that
the spot is a donk
we really don't know and so again this
isn't really enough information but it's
another thing that we can kind of be
suspicious about so he flatted queen ace
queen suited pre and then he also
didn't daunt this turn when he most
likely should just be donking the turn
so anyways when we when we go back and
look at the
the non-heart combos we can see the dunk
range is very merged there's all kinds
of different hands here
there's even some jams and a lot of this
is just
all just has to do with just how far
ahead we are
and so when the small blind does check
and the the the big blind is going to be
checking back a lot because again
he's at a pretty big disadvantage so
he's checking back about 54
and when he does bet he's not he's not
using a lot of these very small sizes
he's going to bet a lot some
like strong value hands and he's just
gonna put hands that basically want to
put a lot of money in the middle of the
hands he's going to be betting
and because of that queen eight really
isn't betting much
and when it bets it's using 43 a pot
and it the only hands that are betting
are hands that have some flush drop
blockers
and that's a pretty important thing to
note because when when you have these
flush draw blockers
you just have slightly more equity
because one when you get called by
flushes they have less outs
and two you don't get raised as much
because a lot of the a lot of the raises
are flush draws or pair plus flush draws
so it's pretty important in the suit
selection here
and we can see limitless exact hand
queen of clubs
eight of spades is just checking pure
and it's actually a pretty big ev
difference
we can see checking is 16 gigs of ev
and using any other sizes he's losing
about four big blinds of eb
and so that's quite interesting
i don't think queen eight is a very
intuitive um
intuitive barrel here i think limitless
did this on purpose
i think it's pretty far off from theory
and i think there was some exploitative
things going on here
it's possible that when we look at the
small blind range it's possible that
tough shark is not playing this properly
there's a lot of ways that this could be
messed up
it's possible that he's just over
raising some some flush draws
um maybe like ace check should only call
but he's raising too often maybe
a lot of these a lot of these other nut
flush draws are just
maybe they're just jams for him maybe
he's only jamming
not flush draws and he's not calling
much maybe he's calling too much of
of ace highs maybe he's calling ace ten
off too much and
limitless knows this and so he gets more
value when he bets
maybe limitless knows that he doesn't
donk his flush draws here
and now he has wait uh way too many
flush draws on this turn
and now queen eight gets some value from
these flush draws
limitless could have some pretty
advanced things limitless might even
know
that that tough shark is going to jam
too often and bet
queen eight fully fully with the plan to
call down a jam because tough shark is
just
extremely aggressive and queen eight is
just a value hand against this specific
player
and against the jam against the jam
these queen eight hands are still
folding and again
it's pretty big ev difference we're
looking at 14 to 20 big blinds of ev
calling this jam with queen eight so
limitless
is pretty far out in the weeds so it's
either limitless is just not very good
at poker which
i'm pretty sure that's not true and or
or
tough shark is pretty bad at poker and
limitless is exploiting him
i'm going to lean towards saying tough
shark is not a very good reg not a high
level pro
maybe he's beating lower stakes but 25
50 maybe he wasn't beating it maybe he
is now
it's very hard to tell i did do a little
bit of research i looked at his high
stakes database and
basically that that site has him down
about 160k
of course this is only 2550 hands and up
for the high stakes db hands
so it's possible that
maybe he's up in other stakes or lower
stakes or on different sites
it's pretty difficult to really know who
this player is i looked at some other
hand histories
that he just really blasted off he
really sent some bluffs that
definitely shouldn't have been sent and
i think it's
pretty interesting to look at that but
even knowing that little amount of
information
we have really just we just don't have
enough information
for a fully understanding strategy to be
just implemented here against his
specific player
but there are many different ways that
limitless could be exploiting here
but the point is is limitless is really
far out in the exploit land
now if a player was over bluffing
theoretically
you would just call a ton you would
barely ever
fold and you really don't need to add
that many bluffs for
the for the caller to end up calling a
ton
you only need to add a handful of combos
and queen eight off i'm sure will become
a call
and so it's not that unreasonable
that tough shark is just over bluffing
maybe he's way too aggressive
and limitless knows that and he's just
going to call down with
all kinds of stuff and here it obviously
worked and he obviously had a hand that
most likely shouldn't be jamming and
most likely should be for betting pre
and so looking at this spot i think it's
pretty important
to try to first get that theoretical
backing down
i think it's going to be really
interesting i might do some more
research and try to understand what kind
of player
tough shark is if anyone in comments
understands what kind of player this
this guy is that would be really helpful
as well i think
there's many different lines here that
limitless could take that
is going to be very dependent on which
exploit he's going to
implement because we don't really know
how tough shark is deviating here but
all in all very interesting hand i'm
kind of interested in how
other people would exploit a player when
you saw this
what kind of things how you would
deviate when you saw him
maybe you saw him call ace queen suited
here and you didn't and you didn't four
bet and
how would you exploit that going forward
i think it's kind of interesting
i think there's a lot of different ways
calling queen eight off here
i'm pretty sure probably has a lot to do
with tough shark just blasting off in a
lot of spots and limitless seeing that
and limitless just saying tough shark
you're just way too aggressive i'm just
gonna call with any pair here
and it's probably that simple that that
limitless just
understands that tough shark is just way
too aggressive and he's just gonna call
any pair because tough shark just has
all kinds of flush draws
so it's kind of interesting let me know
what you guys think of the video
i appreciate you guys watching and i'll
be back
you
