### TOPIC: hand review
hello Wizards today we've got another
exciting hand history review played
between Linus Love and Berry Sweet
before we get into it you guys should
know that this was recorded back in
February of 2022 so our interface and
solutions have been updated since then
we thought we should release this video
anyway as you guys might enjoy the
content anyway
here's the hand
so for those that don't know Linus and
Barry have been battling it out in the
high stakes heads up straights lately so
far it's been going pretty well for
Barry we're going to go through a few of
their more exciting hands followed by an
in-depth GTO review Linus opens on the
button with Ace 10 off
Barry calls Queen jack off
10-3-2 rainbow
we see a third pot C bet
and Barry check raises
Linus three bets
Barry four bits with Queen High
and Linus just calls
turn 10 gives him trips Barry continues
to Barrel Linus smooth plays it
Barry shoves the river and Linus has an
easy call with trip tents alright let's
dive into the GTO analysis
for this hand I'm using the heads up
simple cash game Solutions 100 big
blinds deep
Linus opens
and Barry calls in the big blind with
Queen jack off
we see a 10-3-2 rainbow board
check
actions on Linus so before we proceed I
should point out that this won't just be
a strategy review part of my goal here
is to teach you guys how to use GTO
wizard more effectively I'm going to
take you through my process which is a
little more intuitive and step back I
don't really fixate on frequencies so
much as I do look for overarching
patterns so when a lot of people look at
this hand Matrix they're going to get
confused you know how do you remember
all of this stuff and the truth is you
don't you don't remember all of this
stuff
you look for heuristics
so on 1032 there's really two things you
should be paying attention to the first
thing is do you have an over car to the
10 and the second thing is do you have
any straight draw potential with the two
and the three
those are the two main factors that'll
make you want to bet more often for
example these lower cards which connect
better to the two and the three tend to
bet more often
these over cards like King Jack being
jacked into bet more often
and
over cards where you have one middling
card a one over card tend to be checked
more often
now you can get a little more in depth
by exploring the filters for example you
can see over pairs plus always betting
you can see top pair bedding with a
better Kicker more often uh you can see
for example under pairs betting when
they're more vulnerable
second and third pair betting more often
when they have an over card
and you can also get into it with suits
so for example I can change this to
horizontal mode that'll show me every
combination and here we see this pattern
where the Spade tends to be checked more
often because it doesn't have a backdoor
flush draw
alternatively you can apply a suit
filter so for example including Spade
here we see the checking frequency is 45
percent
apply this filter
goes up to 49 applied again it goes up
to 54 percent
so you can already develop some very
basic heuristics that way
now something else you should always do
in these spots is just take a look at
the ranges tab get a sense for how this
board hits both players
so here we can see it's a very
symmetrical Equity distribution uh no
one really has much of a nut Advantage
either way
Equity is almost exactly 50 50. but the
big difference is that the imposition
player will realize more equity and
therefore has more EV
now you may be asking yourself at this
point how am I going to know all of this
stuff well one strategy you can use to
try and figure out these spots more
easily is to look for General Trends in
the aggregate reports
so here we see a report of all 1755
flops I'm going to filter this report
for rainbow
unpaired disconnected boards and then
I'm going to group it by rank
so here we see acai boards King High
boards so on and so forth
now we notice a pattern jumps up pretty
immediately
as this number gets lower the BET size
increases and the BET frequency
decreases right so for example
on a seven High disconnected rainbow
flop you typically want to bet larger
and as that goes up to say a king high
or queen High flop you want to use a
smaller bet size more frequently ten
high sits somewhere right in the middle
there but if we get a little more
specific with our filters we can view
flops
and here you see that some 10 High
boards are even over betting but these
really dry ones like 10-3-2 have less
draw potential and therefore tend to use
smaller bet sizes
so now that we have a sense for how the
spot plays let's dive into the action
Linus decides to go for a one-third bet
here
actions on Barry
so facing this one-third bit Barry has a
decision to make with his Queen jack off
does he want to call or does he want to
check raise it I think some players
would just fold this but in a heads up
game that's a little too tight Queen
Jack has a lot of equity against the top
of their range for example it can
outdraw a lot of 10x hands and for that
reason it plays more like a draw and it
needs to continue here
so
let's take a look at the overall
thresholds because I'm not just
interested in what queen Jack is doing
I'm interested in what Linus is
targeting with this bet we can see hands
as strong as king X start to fold here
get a better sense for that in the
filters tab where we can see this is
about the line of your continue range uh
King High no made hands
we can see that a little more easily in
the breakdown tab where all the ace
Highs are still calling but King High
and worse than King High start to fold
versus this size
as far as the raising range goes we can
see it splits its size between three
different types of races here and some
players will see this in just
immediately panic but don't panic you're
not expected to memorize three different
race sizes what you can do is simply
group them together and get a better
General sense of things
hover over this icon to see how the
raising range is constructed
we can see that about 30 percent of the
Rays is top pair Plus for value and the
rest of it is merging with these weak
Pairs and draws
in general you want to use about
one-third value to two-thirds Bluffs on
a flop check raise
in a single raised pot the math behind
that is set up so that you can have good
value to Bluff ratios by the river the
math is a little too complex to get into
for this video but if you guys want more
of that toy game content just let me
know in the comments so something else
you can do here is compare the raising
frequency on this board to the raising
frequency on the reports and we see that
across all flops it tends to raise about
11 facing a third pot bet so now you
have a general idea of how often you
ought to be raising in these spots we
can see it raises these sets to pair for
value
it does have
a little bit of top pair in there
and for draws we see a lot of things
that connect with the two and three and
that have over cards so to see that
let's filter by raise
let's apply
weak and trash hand filters and these
are the Bluffs
six five five four six four Jack four
Jack five all of these hands have good
back to a straight draw potential good
backdoor flush draw potential and
potentially over cards to top pair
that's how you know it's a good bluff
candidate
if we look at the expected value
we can get a better sense for which
hands are closed so for example asex
here is kind of close even though it's
pure calling
King x with a back door is kind of close
even though it's pure calling these are
your threshold hands and it's important
to pay attention to which hands are kind
of close so that you can readily adapt
your strategy
we see that Queen Jack
can check race here
and Barry does just that action on Linus
so facing this check raise we can see
that the GTO solution tends to gist call
or fold not doing a whole lot of raising
in general I think a lot of players
would just simplify this to a two-action
strategy and not raise at all and if we
compare it to the reports we can see
that over all possible flops
in position is not raising here very
much at all only about three percent
part of the reason for that is that
Barry's check raise is quite polarized
we can see in the best hands category
here these are hands with at least 75
Equity 26 percent of Barry's range
consists of best Tans well only about
3.7 percent of linuses range contains
these hands
we can get a little more detailed
breakdown in the advanced tab here and
again we see this big nut Advantage for
Barry and that's going to prevent Linus
from getting too out of line with any
more raises
however Linus is no normal human he
knows that Ace 10 off is one of your
highest frequency three bets here and
more so than sets than two pair uh
in fact the type of hands it likes to
raise for value
typically include
these vulnerable made hands so here you
can see I have applied a raise filter
I've applied a good and a best hands
filter and we can see that hands which
race for Value consists of these
vulnerable value hands like Jax Ace 10
King 10
these hands are ahead of the top pair
medium kicker kind of stuff that Barry's
raising with while also being vulnerable
enough to benefit from a raise rather
than trying to keep Barry's range super
wide
so
Linus makes the three bet
actions on Barry basing the three-bet
queen jack off has another decision to
make we can see that it's indifferent
between folding calling and raising
now some people might be surprised like
why on Earth would you call with Queen
High here but keep in mind this hand
does play very close to a draw got two
over Cards Against The Ten you block
Jacks which are one of Linus's most
common value bets here so this hand can
play as a call sometimes
Arie however elects to forbit and you
can't really blame him because in
general you're going to forebet a lot
here this is because first of all you're
out of position so there's less
incentive to call and more incentive to
take the pot down now we can see that
reflected in the reports tab basing a
three bet we can see out of position
generally four bets quite frequently and
this is partly to do with the fact not
just that you're at a position but also
that three bet uses very strong Bluffs
so that further decreases your incentive
to call and increases your incentive to
raise them off those strong Bluffs now
we can see the Rays here mainly consists
of sets and two pair for Value merging
with some top pair second pair
and a whole lot of gut shots
so Barry puts in the format actions back
on Linus with Ace 10 off so we see a
series of raises actions back on Linus
with his Ace 10 off suit and here we
could see that this hand shoves quite
frequently here same with queens and
Jacks these hands are all vulnerable
value hands that benefit from folding
out those strong draws and just getting
the stacks in now however Ace 10 could
also mix in calls now we see as again
I'm going to compare to the general
reports even though we're in position
here it's full it's raising a ton 18.6
of in positions range is now shoving and
this is again because the value of those
Bluffs is quite high so there's more
value in folding out those Bluffs and
less value in calling as much
let's take a quick peek at the ranges
tab again and I want to see the equity
graph in full
here we can see this blue line that's
Barry's line has a massive advantage
throughout
um so Linus really does need to fold
quite a bit
to catch up here
so he makes the call
and we turn
a ten of Spades
the tennis Spades is an absolute
disaster for Barry's range it's really
bad the problem is that it removes a lot
of these 10 3 10 2 combos from his range
as well as counterfeits his three Deuce
so it severely degrades the value
portion of his range
we can see that reflected in the turn
reports so this shows the strategy
across all possible turn cards you can
see that board pairing cards in general
like tens threes and twos
remove a lot of those value hands from
his range and therefore the solver bets
these cards less often
uh
on contrast
turns which complete a lot of straight
draws such as fours five sixes even an
ace these tend to be bet more frequently
as they tend to be better for Barry's
range
here we can see an EV distribution by
selecting these two buttons up top and
in fact we can make this a little easier
to look at
by just grouping like cards together
something else you might want to try
here is filtering for Barry's exact hand
for example
here he has Queen of Spades Jack of
Clubs
and now we can see the strategy for this
hand specifically
tends to bet more aggressively using
some of these all-in sizes when it picks
up that gut shot and in general
barreling quite frequently on low cards
and on Ace so despite this being a
terrible card for its range the silver
does like to check with Queen Jack here
but Barry doesn't play by our rules he
only plays by his own rules
he continues for third pot actions on us
and if your line is here and you've got
Ace 10
you might be thinking hey this is a
value hand you know I'm way ahead I've
got trips with top kicker what could go
wrong but keep in mind this was a four
bet on the Flop your Ace 10 is not so
much a value hand here as it is a medium
strength Showdown value hand
you can see it only has about 52 percent
equity so when you see the solver for
example shoving King 10 here that's more
of an equity realization play than a
value bet
here in the ranges tab we can see that
Barry's range is supposed to be about 50
percent bullhouses which have our trips
crushed of course
now
in practice he might be a little more
Bluff heavy given that he's barreling
his Queen Jack here but hey who knows
so Linus makes the call and there's only
about a half pot behind on the river and
we get the eight of spades now to be
honest the eight of spades is kind of a
non-consequential brick at this point
because Barry is polarized to boats
trips and garbage and not much in
between
uh it doesn't really interact with the
range as much we can see there's about a
41 part behind and the silver constructs
the shoving range using about 75 percent
boats and 25 Bluffs
so what's interesting about a 7525 split
well if we just run a quick pot odds
calculation there is shoving 45 the pot
after it's called is about 200. Linus
needs about 20 to 23 equity and the
solver is bluffing about a quarter of
the time so that's about right
now at this point Barry can't afford to
give up too much we can see the silver
is barreling quite often if you four bet
the Flop Barrel the turn and then give
up a ton on the river you're probably
going to be very exploitable and most
likely you're over bluffing earlier
streets so he knows he does need to
shove quite a bit here however Queen
Jack in particular uh the silver mostly
just gives up with this hand I'm going
to switch over to full height for a
second this makes it easier to see
things in the range I don't normally
recommend this view because it's a
little misleading normalized will give
you a better picture of what's actually
going on but when you want to zoom in on
some combos full height is okay
here we can see that it does prefer to
shove with the Queen of Diamonds and I
think this is just to do with a blocker
effect there's no ten of diamonds on the
board so
you know Queen Jack with the Queen of
Diamonds tends to block more Queen 10
taipans
so
anyway
Barry shops
and actions back on Linus
and what to do
with Ace 10 here well we see all the
trips all the trips are calling here and
that's mainly just due to blocker effect
you're not even that happy to call
you have about 25 Equity you're really
close to indifferent
these trips always call due to some
small blocker effects however if Barry
was even a little bit too value heavy
the solver would snap fold all of these
trips
so what's berry actually targeting with
this size well mostly over pairs Jacks
Queens Kings Aces we can see that these
hands have almost exactly the right pot
odds to call or fold they're very close
to the line so these are the hands that
are actually being targeted
in the breakdown tab we can maybe get an
easier way to view
the thresholds so over pairs this is the
indifference region trips plus pretty
much always calling and you don't even
really have any combinations of you know
second pair even though it does call
sometimes just due to blocker effects
similarly we can see for example A2
calling here that's mainly just because
the deuce blocks uh a good chunk of
Barry's value range
so in the ranges tab we're going to see
a polarization effect so this Blue Line
This is Barry's Equity distribution we
can see he has a lot of very strong
hands very weak hands whereas Linus has
all of these Bluff catchers we can see
that the majority of linuses range does
sit on this long flat Green Line
indicating that these hands are very
close to indifferent realistically any
hand that beats these Bluffs and loses
to this value is going to sit somewhere
along this indifferent Bluff catcher
region
nevertheless
Linus knows that Ace 10 here is a snap
call he makes the call catches the bluff
and takes it down wow what a fascinating
line by both players with a free BET and
then a four bet correctly on the Flop
barreling turn shoving River just ice in
his veins I really hope we can see more
from these players going forward I'm
really enjoying these heads up matches
and I hope you guys got a few things out
of my process and learned a few tips and
tricks along the way as always if you
