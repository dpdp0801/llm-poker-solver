### TOPIC: mastering flop exploits
welcome to this presentation my name is
sergio today you're gonna you're going
to learn how to exploit your opponents
on the flat for maximum profit what you
will learn today is going to be how to
detect flop leaks using a few different
methods huds mda paying attention to
showdowns and a few more you will learn
how to estimate evs in real time and
know which action is the most profitable
on the flop with each different hand and
very importantly you will learn how to
not get detected while applying these
exploits as to keep your exploits
working long term over months and also
to avoid getting re-exploited yourself
and after you learn all of this
you'll be able to profit hopefully more
than your opponents on the flop why does
this matter now in poker everything kind
of matters there's not a theoretical
concept that wouldn't matter at all but
some things do matter a lot more than
others there's definitely a hierarchy of
things you should be thinking about when
you're playing and exploiting the flop
is pretty up there for a few reasons so
one of the reasons is the few spots
where it is fairly realistic to gather
hot stats
that are statistically significant so on
some more obscure line like a river race
it's not just difficult to gather stats
on the hut it's also very difficult to
gather stats on mda or across millions
of hands it's really difficult to have
statistically significant enough data
but for the flop we can gather data for
this we can make good assumptions and
also actions are very close in theory
what this means is that on pretty much
every other street preflop turn river al
most hands are going to have lines that
are fairly clearly better than others at
least a lot of hands
this on the flop is not the case most of
the time specifically when talking about
betting or checking and about sizings
there's a few things that you can do
that are very reasonable in equilibrium
in gto and so finding which one of those
is better in practice is easier and more
valuable than trying to deviate from
from an action that is very very clear
in equilibrium and it's also quite easy
to deviate with these hands to learn
what actions are better against which
opponents there's three or four moving
parts to it but it's definitely easier
than doing something like
learning every seabed strategy down to
the frequency of each hand for
a bunch of
board textures right this is a lot more
condensed into a few ideas that you can
use on many different situations how do
we estimate evs in real time we're not
really going to quantitatively know the
exact number of the ev we're not going
to be doing formulas or math in-game of
course but what we're essentially going
to do is by
using the solver a lot by playing the
solution by looking at sims we're gonna
get a better sense of
what actions are indifferent or close to
indifferent in theory when you are using
gta wizard and you see an action being
mixed sometimes betting sometimes
checking with the same hand that means
that in equilibrium i think it's a
completely balanced opponent those two
actions are worth exactly the same not
almost the same exactly the same so
if we apart from that knowledge the only
thing we need to do is understand
what variables tip the scale one way or
another so for instance if we see that
when a specific combo is in different
from betting half pot or checking we can
use exploitative variables we see in the
real table we're sitting at at the
moment and we can as soon as we see a
small incentive for one of the two
actions then clearly that actually
should be better than the other one
because in equilibrium those two were in
complete balance
let's look at a few examples let's start
with this one so it's going to be a
button first big blind single race pot c
bet uh it's going to be queen 74 rainbow
so uh this is a spot where we open the
button we get called
by the big blind and this kind of like
pretty standard dry disconnected flop
comes and we see that in equilibrium the
frequencies are
and you also got to understand that
equilibrium is pretty fragile in terms
of rake in terms of the pre-flop ranges
as soon as you change a couple variables
this strategy could change for example
if you played higher stakes if you
played instead of 500 now you played
5000 ml the frequency of c betting would
increase because of the big blights
range being a lot wider for instance so
given those limitations we can still use
this to draw some conclusions about
how equilibrium works and why and what
we can see is that
there are
um most hands really are indifferent
between betting small and checking now
the reason for betting small comes down
to
gto reasons like for instance we have an
advantage
very big advantage at this portion of
the range
so hence like
a set a pair of sevens
a pair of nines those hands we are
leveraging so we choose some of those
more
smaller sizings
but what we can see is that
most hands are indifferent okay so we
have a few hands that pretty much
clearly prefer one action over the other
so h9 over here
is nine slash ace 10 a bit of ace eight
and we see that sevens is pure betting
force is pure betting
for a seven so there are a few hands or
a few hand classes that clearly prefer
one thing over the other but then every
other hand class is basically going
either way and that's that goes back to
the couple slides ago where i said that
to exploit and to understand which
actions ev is higher than the other
first we need to part from the
understanding that both are pretty close
in theory those are going to be the kind
of exploits that perform well whereas
taking a line that is for instance
checking back sevens over here even
though there could be scenarios where
your opponent could have such a leak
that checking back sevens
would be the best option we are not
usually going to have enough data to
support and to justify that big of a
deviation so we're usually going to use
all of the other hands to
make our exploits let's go back to the
presentation and
we are going to use piosolver to do a
few
node logs and a few
changes to the sims and
let's see how
they change
our strategy so the node logs are going
to be we are going to reduce big blind's
check race versus the small bet by
around half and then we are also going
to reduce the check raises versus the
overhead and by the way in the sim that
i create in piles over i'm basically
taking the exact ranges from the
wizard so i'm taking all of the
information from the gto wizard sim and
then i'm reducing a few of the sizing so
on the c bet note i'm only allowing for
these two sizings because uh the more
lines you add to the no locks the more
no looks you're gonna have to do from
scratch so i i decided to keep it a
little bit simpler by reducing the
sizings a little bit and i have a
question for you guys so in this sim in
this node locked sim in piyo what do you
guys think is going to be the outcome
remember the original sim the
equilibrium sim is basically betting for
a small sizing at around 60 something
percent of the time what do you guys
think is gonna change when we
not lock this under check raising from
the big line and this is the quiz what
do you guys think is going to be and
there's not one correct answer okay
there's there's multiple
good answers here and there's even some
answers that are reasonable there's a
lot of bet more often on a bit smaller
some people want a bit bigger some
people want to split more sizings
definitely we are all agreeing for the
most part that betting more often is
going to be one of the outcomes of the
symbol
[Music]
so let's
go to the sim let's see the answer to
these questions and the way i frame the
question is also going to let's say
depend on how i run the sim and some
things that i did within the sim so i'll
explain right now so let's bring piyo
over here and we see that this is
basically the same strategy that we've
seen on gta wizard 60 something or 60
betting frequency for a small sizing so
the way most people run node locks is
you know lock your opponent so in this
case let's see i bet small and i have no
luck my opponent to only check race
seven percent of the time so a bunch of
hands that were checking a lot more now
are not check raising as much and now
what people do is they go back to
the engine of the solver and then they
re-run with these new assumptions and
they allow both players to adjust and
readjust their strategies you know to
see what comes up now i think this is
not very representative of how real life
works and with the software you're
always trying to model what people are
really doing in real life that's how you
find what the highest eb play is in
practice and the problem with rerunning
the sim after you know block is that it
assumes that your opponent will on turn
know that he made a mistake on the flop
okay for instance if we don't allow
check raising from out of position the
outer position solver on turn is going
to start dunking or check raising very
aggressively or just changing his
strategy in very dramatic ways to
mitigate the damage that their original
mistake caused in their strategy now
this is not just probably untrue this is
almost necessarily untrue that people do
this because the kind of person that
would fix his mistake on the turn
retroactively would be the kind of
person who didn't even make the mistake
in the first place while the person who
under check raises the flop is going to
be the kind of person that on turn he
doesn't know that he didn't check race
enough so i've done a little bit of a
different thing so what i've done is
i've no blocked our opponent and then i
haven't rerun the same i've just kept
turns and rivers played the same as in
equilibrium and i'm just comparing the
new evs okay so i'm comparing the new
evs that i have first this node locked
opponent without allowing him to
re-adjust on future nodes or future
streets okay so the way i do this is by
clicking on compare action so first
we're going to compare betting small and
checking in terms of ev and then we're
going to compare betting big and betting
small and we'll see what happens so
bearing small and checking now you might
not understand what this means but
basically white means it's pretty close
to indifferent and the more pink it
means that the eevee of betting is so
much higher than the ev of checking and
the ones that are a bit greener means
that the evf of checking is a little bit
higher than embedding now even the ones
that are pretty much why are still
preferring betting small okay so what we
see we see is that there are a bunch of
hands that lightly prefer betting small
and then there are some hands that
clearly very strongly prefer bedding
small which if you remember the original
sim these are precisely the hands that
kind of didn't care in equilibrium right
so these are marginal hands so eight
highs jack highs
you know ten highs these are hands that
in equilibrium where indifferent now are
not just a little bit preferring vetting
small very strongly prefer betting small
so this is very important now almost
every hand prefers betting small and in
fact the marginal weaker hands
are very strong incentivized for betting
rather than checking now we have this i
would say it's a bit of an artifact so
what we'll see right now when we compare
big sizings with small sizes we might
see that some of these hands prefer
betting big rather than betting small
and this is why they're preferring
checking right here but but another
thing i will say and i'll explain it
further later is that sometimes even if
you could picture a scenario with a
bunch of leaks in our opponent strategy
where we could take some let's say
suspicious line ridiculous line we
should probably still be skeptical about
taking that line for for a couple
reasons like if you check back queen
seven first of all you don't know if
your opponent has the the extent of the
leak that you've modeled in the sim it
could be that his league is smaller and
also whenever he sees you checking back
queen seven you are going to raise the
alarms
a lot okay so there's there's a couple
reasons why these few green hats should
be taken with a grain of salt but
definitely these pink ones are very
clearly preferring bedding so this would
turn basically into a range bet scenario
now let's compare bending big with
betting small and let's see it because
in the in the original sim we saw that
basically only betting small was
preferred maybe a little bit of bedding
big but not much let's see what happens
when we compare these two now the colors
might be a little bit more confusing now
but basically the light pink is going to
be preferring betting small and the
darker um or like more bluish
violet is going to be betting big okay
over betting the flop and now we see
that there are some hands unlike on the
original sim where hands either
definitely wanted to bet small or they
maybe were indifferent to betting big
now some hands are clearly preferring
betting bay okay so and these are
if you pay close attention it's going to
be pretty strong hands so
sevens is a bit of violet here fours
good top pairs one two over bet now when
our opponent doesn't check phrases
and and a few specific uh bluffs that
benefit from folding out certain
portions of our opponent's range
but but where i want to draw the
attention is to the
strong hands and the reason if you think
about it is pretty intuitive when you
don't get check raised enough now you
have some hands in your range that wish
you got check raised right like the
reason why in equilibrium you bet small
with force is because you get raised
enough if you don't get raised enough
now suddenly that
reason changes now you would rather just
bet big yourself so if we go back to
presentation and we look at the
answers to the quiz you see that we bet
more often so every hand pretty much is
preferring betting over checking and
then we split more sizes when when we
don't face enough aggression usually
we can start being more face up more
straightforward with our
splitting of our ranges as well and some
people uh answer we bet bigger which
i mean it makes sense uh the two bit
bigger i mean we see that we bet bigger
at a higher frequency so i don't think
that answering that is completely off uh
of base
i would say that the only
clearly wrong
answer would be two bit smaller uh if
you
if you don't get raised you wouldn't
really want to bet smaller uh you would
just increase the
there could be a case in a different sim
where
the original sizing is big
and then maybe if we
reduce the check raises versus small i
think we start betting small a lot so i
guess there's there's some
merit for answering that as well so what
we see is
and this is
kind of like the take away the important
part of what we talked about is that
we're trying to find
the variables that affect ev and the
what we found is that the variables is
that
low aggression
benefits marginal hands okay when we
when there's one line where we face
too
low aggression our weak and marginal
hands benefit a lot from taking that
line and then we saw a little bit as
well that low aggression hinders strong
hands whenever we see a line where we're
not going to face enough aggression our
strong hands are when when our strong
hands are indifferent between two
options and one of them is too low in
aggression from our opponent
we're generally going to opt for the
other option and when we don't face
enough aggression
we play our strong hands more
aggressively ourselves
and this is the splitting thing when
the solver
is betting all of their hands in
the same sizing
yes there's range
reasons and there's balance to be
considered
but each individual hand also needs to
be getting something out of it whenever
the solver does something it's not just
the overall strategy
each individual hand is getting
something out of it okay and if we don't
face enough aggression then our strong
hands are not getting what they need
from those more passive inducing lines
michael says that's the punching back
principle
yes that's exactly the punching back
back principle so let's look at another
example this is going to be
small blind versus big blind
single ray spa seabed and this is king
72 rainbow let's look at gta wizard so
we can see that there's a fairly clear
preference for a certain sizing and
there's also a pretty clear preference
towards mostly betting right
this is a board where you could
reasonably play as a range bet but
that's always checking still
29 of the time
and
again
all of the hands you see pretty much all
of the hands i can't
from
these views see any hand that is pure
bedding well there might be a certain
suit
that that is pure bedding or pure
checking but i don't think so it's
probably all mixed
yeah everything is indifferent this
means that yes even though the solver is
preferring to mostly just bet and play
close to a range bet if your opponent
was playing an exact equilibrium
strategy
you could range check this board and you
would still retain all of your ev not
most all of your ev right
because every hand
doesn't care
and let's see the response when we check
to our opponent so when we check
we see that our point is betting for a
small sizing mostly
leveraging that 7x26 advantage
and it's spending around half of the
time okay and when we bet small
we see that it it's raising around 13 to
14 of the time let's do a note lock here
and let's change
the frequency at which we are opponent
bets when we check to them and
we could do a bunch of node locks
together but i think it's pretty
important when you're trying to test
hypothesis with the solver to try to
contain your
experiments to to one or a couple of
things so that when you get an answer
you know what that answer was affected
by so here i'm just
changing that variable and we're going
to see how it affects it and uh yeah so
let's do another little quiz so we have
a king seventies rainbow blind versus
blind we are the small blind and we
check to our opponent he is going to bed
too often when we check to our opponent
he is going to bit too often what do you
guys think
our seabed strategy is going to do to
exploit our opponent are we going to bet
more often
are we going to bet
less often
are we going to bet a weaker range or
are we going to bet a stronger
range
[Music]
i see that a lot of people say we're
going to bet less often
a lot of people say we're going to bet a
weaker range
no one says we're going to bed more
often
a couple people think we're going to bet
a stronger range so let's see
so again this is the original strategy
pretty much the same as gta wizard but i
did reduce the the possible lines that
we can take and their opponent can take
on the flop as to reduce the the scope
of the experiment and again i'm not
going to note lock and then
allow players to readjust i'm just going
to know look and then see how that
affects my eb right away okay now if we
check to our opponent we saw that and on
the original sim it was in the low 50s
the betting frequency here i know locked
it to be in the low 60s 60s so roughly
10 percent more than the equilibrium
strategy again using the same ranges as
gigi wizard the same everything except
this and let's see the evs how the evs
are affected so let's click on compare
actions and see what happens okay so now
we see that a lot of things are close to
white but even the ones that are close
to y we see that check ev is higher than
that ev and then there's a bunch of
hands that are clearly better as checks
and then some hands that are clearly
better as bets the pink ones are bets
greens are checks the other ones are
different but not quite indifferent
they're still preferring checking a
little bit what we see if you look at
the hand classes that are doing each
thing is that fairly clearly the
stronger hands are all checking and
pretty much the stronger the hand the
more it wants to check almost right so
the good top pairs check a lot and then
some some like draws
are probably checking because check
raising now becomes very profitable and
then we have the hands that prefer
bedding which are mostly the garbage
hand okay we can't see a lot of hands
that are good that prefer bedding
although the pink ones are quite high
jack high high and high so basically
what has happened here is that because
our opponent is putting too much
aggression on that line on the check
line he's applying too much aggression
on it now our strong hands kind of like
the opposite of our previous experiment
our strong hands now are gaining ev from
taking that line which is checking right
and then our weak hands these hands like
jack high still has some equity so it
was indifferent between the two options
partly because by checking it realized a
certain amount of its equity now that we
face a bet too often now we don't
realize as much equity with that jack
high and therefore if it was original
indifferent and now checking is worse
then naturally betting is better than
checking basically our strategy has
turned into mostly checking and then
betting with the weaker portions of our
range to exploit that we bet a weak
admin says we've had a weaker range when
we bet we do not want to face a bet yes
correct the hands that we are betting
are the hands that don't want to face a
bet basically and the hands that we're
checking are the hands that do want to
face aggression
so if we look at the quiz definitely we
bet less often and definitely we bet a
weaker range for the aforementioned
reasons for example if the board was
such that we had a very very low betting
frequency it could potentially be that
we bet more often but on this one
clearly if most hands prefer betting and
now suddenly you add a leak to the
checking range now a lot of those hands
are going to prefer that line so what we
see conclusions we can take away is that
high aggression
benefits strong hands and then high
aggression hinders marginal hands okay
whenever we have two equilibrium in
different hands
lines with a certain hand and now one of
those lines faces
more aggression than the other now
suddenly
the marginal
and weaker hands want to avoid
that line and the stronger hands want to
always take that line essentially now
there's another incentive i want to talk
about
which is what i call fault ev it's
something we can't test easily with the
solver because essentially there's a
limitation with no luck in future
streets if i wanted to no luck facing a
bet very often when i check back the
flop for instance i would have to go to
every turn and no block
the batting frequency of the outer
position player so i'll just explain it
and see what you guys think so fall ev
is the money we make from falls when we
when they happen
minus the money will lose from
continuous when they have assuming let's
assume we have a zero equity hand pretty
much napkins and it would be times how
often we get in a position to bet so let
me kind of like restate that with
different words we have when we have a
bluff the full dv is going to be
how often we get that fault
minus how often we don't get the fault
and how much
we win and we lose on each of those two
scenarios and then times how often we're
getting a position too bad and why is it
important to to point out how often we
get in a position to bet well for
instance when we are c betting the flop
we are getting immediate ev
from folds and then we lose eb when we
get called or raised but when we are
looking in the flop
what our eevee is for
checking back the flop and then bluffing
on the turn
or checking back twice and bluffing on
the river a more like indirect line
to to get that full db
we need to take into account that we're
not always going to be able to bet right
when we check back to flop sometimes
we're going to face a bet and we are not
going to be able to bluff the turn
so we need to calculate the eevee that
we gain when we do bluff and then do
times
how often we are even in a position to
bluff if we take that line the higher
fault ev benefits weaker hands okay this
is very intuitive to understand
when we have an indifferent twin
different actions with hand
with a weak hand with a marginal hand
and one of those is getting too much ev
from folds then naturally that's going
to be an incentive for taking that line
with the weaker hands and potentially
not
taking although not necessarily but
potentially not taking that line with
stronger hands and fold ev
this is kind of important full ev
increases in more indirect lines
the more linearly our opponents
structure their ranges what this means
is that
when a player when our opponent is
playing let's say too straight forward
forward where they bet all of their
strong hands and then they check all of
their weaker hands and maybe they bet
some bluffs out of the weaker hands
but
their their checking range is capped and
maybe too weak which is
i would say how most people
who haven't put a lot of work in their
game are going to end up leaking
so when people play in that way
linearly
then the full ev is going to increase
for the more indirect line so waiting
for them to see if they check
and then bluffing is going to be
very good versus those kinds of players
whereas if a player was to always bluff
with all of his air whenever we check to
him a very aggressive polarized player
and every time he checks
it's going to be
medium strength hands then
this
waiting to bet later is going to become
worse basically
the more we
give them a chance to check
the more they're going to strengthen
their checking range and in the other
case with the other player the more we
give them a chance to check the more
they're going to weaken their checking
range and grant us additional folding ev
so let's talk about leak detection
because it is very easy to say what to
do once you know that your opponent has
that leak but it's not as easy to know
if your opponent has really that leak
because there's a lot of
caveats and nuances to to data gathering
in poker so the methods we can use and
we're going to use is going to be huds
and i have here that we need hundreds of
cases of each specific situation what i
mean by this is that most people use
huds wrong in that
they overestimate the statistical
significance of
uh their the sample they have okay to
have a significant stat on for example
your opponent's flat check race you are
going to need hundreds of cases where
your opponent has the opportunity to
check raise okay
and this is going to amount in some
cases to
five-digit five-digit samples on your
opponent so having like ten thousand
twenty thousand thirty thousand hands
on your specific opponent
to have that
three hundred
cases of facing a c bet so this is
pretty important
and a lot of the time uh you're not
going to in fact most of the time you're
not going to have that kind of sample
unless you're playing
the same players over pretty much months
you're not going to have that sound
although sometimes you will so it's
important to understand how to use huds
naturally another method for detecting
leaks is going to be
rather than detecting our specific
opponent's leaks we use mda
which stands for
mass data analysis
we're going to use this to essentially
aggregate every player from our pool
from a game and pool and kind of like
see their hud together in aggregate
right so the benefits of doing this is
that you can get a lot more data a lot
more statistical significance by
gathering
instead of 10 000 hands a million hands
from your pool right so the other
benefit is also you can get into more
obscure lines now you start having more
data of
more special lines rather than the most
obvious ones uh now
this also has limitations which is
basically when you play the same against
everyone there's a couple problems so
when you you
develop leaks or exploits that work
against
your pool overall first of all you're
not going to be making optimal plays
against everyone right they're going to
be some players that you're going to be
that they're going to be basically like
blind spots in your
in your strategy and also when you play
the same against everyone you start
becoming pretty easy to read especially
if you play on a side with huds if you
play the site with nicknames if you play
the same i guess everyone it starts
becoming pretty obvious whereas if you
play different against different people
it is very hard to track exactly
how you're adjusting against each
individual and then i would say my
favorite way of detecting leaks is
profiling so profiling kind of means
using the two first approaches together
so we use mda to
create a few different profiles so for
example type player or type regular
recreational
loose regular standard regular
we have a few different profiles that we
learned their their tendencies through
mda through gathering many many hands
and then we use the hud
instead of to know exactly their
frequencies to a specific degree we use
the hat just to loosely categorize that
player into one of those groups and then
we use our knowledge from that group
both from mda and just intuition
experience we use that knowledge to
exploit what we expect to be likely
leaks from that profile and um
the last method i want to talk about is
going to be showdowns basically very
simply put a lot of the time your
opponents are going to take lines that
whenever you see one or two showdowns
you will know a lot about their overall
frequency so whenever especially when
they take a line that shouldn't be taken
at all so if you
knew although for the flop this is not
going to be
very common because as i said and this
is why i put this the last of the four
because specifically for the flop since
most options are generally
decent it's gonna it's going to be hard
to find a player making a
showdown clear mistake
from the flop okay this is more common
on the river if you know a certain hand
shoot value bet for instance on the
river and then you see a player check it
back
you can gather a lot of information
about their betting frequency there for
instance i don't flop that's it's going
to be harder to use so let's talk about
what to compare those stats to because
again it's kind of easy when you
have the data to know what to do
but data get gathering and
knowing where to look is
just
as or more important than than the
decision itself so what i'm going to do
is
look at gta wizard and its aggregate
report
utility to look at
overall
frequencies across boards which is what
we can compare to the data we have from
our opponents which
most of the time the data we're going to
have from our opponents is also going to
be aggregate stats from every board in
aggregate right
so this is bottom versus big blind
single base spot c bet and right now we
are looking at
our cbd frequencies all of these down
here are specific
boards but up here where it says bottom
versus big blind this is the overall
frequencies okay so we see that our
overall frequency should be around 53 to
54
uh betting and 46 check
now what happens when we for instance
bet small
so when we bet small our opponent is
supposed to raise 14 of the time if we
put these two numbers together
our opponent is supposed to raise around
14 of the time and fold around 34 of the
time so here you have numbers that you
can compare to those hot stats to that
mda
to see if your opponents are falling
more than this
less than this for that full ev
incentive if your opponents are raising
the flop too much
not enough
again for those incentives
we can look also at what happens when we
for instance
check back
this is um
this is going to be on a specific board
but we can still make it work
let's give it a
so when we check back on a board like
jack eight three two tone we're gonna
see that
the solver is only betting into us so
this is a turn pro by the out of
position player
31 to 32 percent of the time
right
so
you can with your intuition with mda
think about whether you think your
opponents are betting more often less
often and again this comes down to the
aggression incentive we're getting too
much aggression on this line and we're
getting too little aggression what does
our marginal and
strong hands want to do given that
incentive
and then we can also look at that full
eb
incentive by looking at what happens
when we
delay cbet right so flop goes check
check our opponent checks the turnout
position and then we bet
three-quarters pod what is he supposed
to be falling okay we see 52 percent of
the time okay our opponent should be
folding 52 percent of the time so
when it comes to a one-third bet on flop
and 75 bet on turn the equilibrium point
for that full dv is 34 percent fall on
flap
52 full on turn when our opponents start
tilting off of that
equilibrium point
we start getting more fall ev from one
of those two lines okay
we can also look at
a situation like
fly versus line c bet right
where
we are supposed to bet
seabed only around 40
low 40s percent
what happens when we bet small
okay so a bit small we're supposed to
get raised around 13 of the time and get
only 25 percent false that's very
interesting
and when we check
this blind spine scenario
we are supposed to face a bet on
aggregate only 37 percent of time 36 37
of the time so again
we are seeing
a few
equilibrium points between aggressions
that we face on both lines
and we can also see
um
equilibrium points between full dbs
between different lines and then we can
compare those what we think people are
doing
uh
hint
i think most people on lower stakes are
not going to be
able to
fall only 25 or small bet
but basically this is how you can
actually use
on the one hand huds and mda to know
what your opponents are doing and then
use gta wizard to know
what they should be doing and
develop your strategy from that
how to avoid detection so let's talk a
little bit about how to avoid detection
the first thing we can do
is to avoid suspicious sizings okay so
whenever we are on a board where
no one
has ever overbet in the history of poker
that if we over bet it's going to be a
bit sus okay we're trying to make our
exploits brief not when we play
recreationals necessarily but when we're
playing on other wrecks we're preferably
using sizings that will an exploits that
will work for months on end okay if an
exploit is like five percent better but
it only works for a couple weeks then it
would be better to make the exploit a
little bit worse and just hammer it
endlessly right so avoiding suspicious
sizes helps with that avoiding
suspicious lines with specific combos
and this is kind of in the same spirit
as the first point so when we have that
bottom set even though there could be
some possibly uh realistic leak that
your opponent could have that would make
you check back that bottom set it's
probably not worth it for a couple
reasons first of all you don't know how
reliable your read is it could be that
your reading is wrong in that case if
your read is wrong you would at least
want to at least take indifferent line
and not a slum dunk bad line right and
the other reason is that it's gonna look
very bad your opponents are gonna be a
lot more likely to understand what
you're trying to do if they see one of
those showdowns if the hud
or the site allows for huds
don't play the same way against everyone
okay so
using a purely
based strategy
site with huds is going to end up making
you
your own stats on your hud look very
very off balance right whereas if you
play if you apply different exploits
against different player profiles your
overall stats that people see are going
to end up looking
more normal harder to read what you're
actually doing against each individual
opponent another very important thing to
avoid detection is going to be
understanding the pitfalls of your
exploitative strategy and then paying
attention to showdowns this means that
whenever you do if you remember the king
seven deuce rainbow blind versus blind
seabed strategy it should be a range bet
but now suddenly we're starting to check
only with the strong hands and then
betting the weak hands now we need to
understand why what we're doing is
kind of wild okay why is it exploitable
well it's because if is because our
opponent should respond
by
never falling to our seabed
raising our seabed to insane degrees if
not always and then whenever we check to
him he should just never bluff into us
because we're waiting for that bluff
with open arms right and he shouldn't be
betting thin because we're checking all
of our knotted hands
uh as
as our exploits so we need to understand
what is
his
re
exploit against our exploit and then if
we see that be reflected in the
showdowns we should start getting
suspicious about what's going on right
so if we know that
let's give a different example see if we
knew that
the exploit against our exploit would be
to check back
a set and when we do see that set at
showdown in the check line we should get
very suspicious that we are getting
re-exploited but i want to make it very
clear and the last point most people
won't detect you anyway so don't worry
and it's not just don't worry don't
worry and also be skeptical of when you
think
someone has detected so if you see
someone raising the flop three four
times in a row against you it could just
be that they had their
the the kind of range that should
raise those four times in a row so don't
be too quick to
assume detection because there's a
minority of players that are even caring
about this kind of stuff and even the
players that care about this stuff are
going to have to pay a lot of attention
they're going to have to take a long
time gathering data from you and it's
going to be very likely that whenever
you find someone that you think or is uh
has detected you might just be you know
randomly check raising you a few times
in a row for no reason so summary many
actions are indifferent and flop okay
leaks tip the scale out of indifference
the way we construct our exploits is by
detecting in different
points and then seeing how leaks tip the
scale out of that indifference different
hands benefit from different leaks
namely weak hands benefit from low
aggression and are hindered by high
aggression and they are also benefited
from fold ev and then strong hands are
benefited by high aggression and then
hindered by lines with low aggression
from our opponent's
shoes another very important point is to
gather data cautiously okay don't just
look at your hud
see that your opponent check raised you
two out of three times which is 67
and be like oh this is a very high
aggression line from him so i'm going to
stuff all of my hands in this line or
whatever it is be cautious be skeptical
of the validity of your data and usually
just make small changes if you make
small changes within the
close to a different hands you're going
to be crushing and then compare the data
to gto it's not enough with just knowing
what your opponent's frequencies are
there's this debate about do we use huds
do we use solvers well if you use a hud
you should also use the solver because
you need to know what the frequency
should be in order to know when the
scale has tipped out of indifference and
yeah
thanks for watching guys see you
whenever we have the next presentation
hope you have very good luck at the
tables
