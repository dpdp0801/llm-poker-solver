### TOPIC: mtt fundamentals the theory of risk advantage
you've probably heard of Poker Concepts 
like nut advantage and range Advantage  
but in this video I'm going to introduce 
A New Concept which applies specifically  
to tournament play that concept is 
called risk Advantage let's take a look
hi Wizards I'm Matt hunt and in this video we're 
going to be discussing an idea which I believe is  
pivotal for understanding how tournament ranges 
are constructed when ICM is in play a concept I'm  
referring to as risk Advantage I've never seen 
this concept discussed anywhere else so there's  
a good chance you're actually seeing its creation 
here in real time but having spent a good deal of  
time with the GTO wizard library of pre-flop Sims 
I think it's arguably one of the most important  
ideas in tournament poker so I'm glad to have the 
opportunity to talk about it with all of you let's  
start by backing up a little And discussing some 
of the basic principles of tournament ICM before  
you watch this video I highly recommend you check 
out the YouTube videos by my fellow GTO wizard  
coach Tom Boss 21 specifically the videos titled 
visualizing ICM and you're playing tournaments  
wrong since those videos will explain in detail 
a lot of Concepts I'm going to reference in this  
one the first of those Concepts is the idea of 
risk premium where the presence of ICM means that  
the downside of losing chips is greater than 
the upside of winning chips this graphic here  
taken from one of Tom Boss videos illustrates 
this concept really well the specifics of this  
scenario aren't really important but the red area 
on this graphic represents the extent of our risk  
premium for this particular spot we can see that 
as the level of risk increases the premium imposed  
on us to justify the risk also grows significantly 
in a somewhat non-linear fashion despite the fact  
that a small level of risk in this spot such as 
calling a basic pre-fought raise only involves a  
small risk premium this does still influence our 
pre-fought ranges in a significant way since any  
chips we will eventually put into the pot post 
flop also come with a risk premium especially any  
spot where we end up making a big Bluff or Bluff 
catch on the river when there's a risk premium  
placed on us we're getting a worse effective price 
to call any pre-fought rays but the same is also  
true for our opponents and since each player has a 
slightly different risk premium against each other  
player based on stack sizes everyone's getting 
a slightly different effective price we'll come  
back to that concept very soon the other concept 
we'll need to be aware of is introduced in the  
other tombos video I referenced the idea that ICM 
only really starts to significantly outperform  
chippyv once we get down to around 50 of the field 
remaining in a tournament it's not crucial that we  
go into why this is the case in this video but 
it is the reason why we're going to focus most  
mostly on spots where we have less than half 
the field remaining these spots will provide  
the best examples of what I mean when I'm talking 
about risk Advantage so what actually is this  
concept of risk Advantage well it operates in 
a similar way to other advantage-based Concepts  
we might talk about in a variety of different 
contexts like not advantage or Equity advantage  
another advantage means we possess a greater 
density of nut hands than our opponent in a  
given spot an equity or range advantage means our 
range has more Equity than our opponent's range  
a risk Advantage works in the same way having a 
risk advantage means we have a greater capacity  
to take on risk against a specific opponent than 
they do against us this happens anytime our risk  
premium against them is lower than their risk 
premium against us with the difference between  
the two risk premiums being the extent of the risk 
advantage anytime risk premiums are asymmetric  
which is any time two players have different stack 
sizes a risk Advantage is present in some form  
if our risk premium against our opponent is five 
percent but theirs against us is 10 then we have  
a risk advantage of five percent sounds fairly 
simple right well not quite it might sound like  
this just refers to any spot where we have our 
opponent outshipped but there are actually a few  
different factors which affect risk Advantage 
so let's explore them a little and then look  
at some examples in general risk Advantage is 
only going to be present in a substantial way  
in a given spot once we've reached the point in 
the tournament where ICM starts to ramp up this  
will usually be around 50 of the field and Below 
as we've mentioned but depending on the nature  
of the payout structure and field size there 
might be some slight variation here as a whole  
though we won't see substantial risk advantage 
in play early on in a tournament it's also only  
really going to exist when one player outships 
another substantially while having an opponent  
covered to any extent does theoretically give 
a player a slight risk Advantage this will be  
reduced when Stacks are closer together since the 
shorter player still has the ability to win most  
of the deeper players stack it's not possible for 
the player with the shorter stack to have a risk  
Advantage because the fact that they can't bust 
the other player from the event simply prevents  
this from being the case however as we'll see 
later on when we look at some examples there's  
a big difference between a player being marginally 
covered versus significantly covered and the depth  
of stacks relative to the average stack will also 
be important this last factor is a huge element  
in Risk advantage the more valuable the shorter 
of two stacks is the more leverage the covering  
player has over that stack if we're second in 
chips but there's a player with a massive chip  
lead they have a huge risk advantage over 
us because our stack is very valuable but  
they're the only player who can bust us if the 
shorter stack has any more than about half the  
average stack that's a fairly valuable stack so 
the larger stack has a fair amount of Leverage  
there this creates the traditional Dynamic that 
you'll be familiar with if you've done a lot of  
ICM work where the middle Stacks get heavily 
leveraged by the fact that they have a lot to  
lose in comparison with the short stacks in fact 
as a whole risk Advantage conceptually serves as a  
way to measure one specific player's capacity to 
exert ICM pressure over another specific player  
at a given stage in the tournament keep this in 
mind as we move forward so in the end there are  
two main factors which influence the scope of a 
player's risk Advantage the difference between  
the two stacks and the overall ICM value of the 
shorter stack now let's run through some examples  
to show you what I mean in more detail we're 
going to look purely at the risk premiums to  
start with and we're not going to consider each 
player's actual strategy that part comes later  
so this first example here you can see is from 
the very first hand of the tournament all Stacks  
have 200 big blinds and as you can tell everybody 
has a 1.8 risk premium nobody has a risk advantage  
over anyone else in a spot like this simply based 
on the fact that everybody has the power to bust  
anybody else nobody has a bigger stat than anyone 
else so risk premiums are going to be the same  
all the way around very very simple scenario 
in this second example with 50 of the field  
remaining you can see that the risk premiums are 
now different between each player this is because  
ICM has started to become a consideration here 
in this spot the average stack is about 60 big  
blinds and you can see that the LoJack and the 
hijack here have a very high risk premium versus  
each other because the LoJack has 110 big blinds 
and the hijack has a hundred big blinds and the  
LoJack only has a 0.2 percent risk Advantage based 
on the fact that they cover the hijack however if  
we look at the low Jack versus the button you can 
see that the LoJack has a risk premium versus the  
button of 2.5 percent while the button with their 
45 big blind stack has a risk premium against  
the LoJack of three percent this means that the 
LoJack has a 0.5 percent risk advantage in this  
specific scenario which will affect the way that 
the LoJack is going to play against the button  
in this next example with 25 of the field 
remaining where we're getting closer to  
the bubble and the average stack is still 50 
big blinds we have a stack setup that sees an  
under the gun player here with 125 big blind so 
two and a half times the average stack and this  
player has a big risk Advantage versus everyone as 
the big stack here but focus on two other Stacks  
here the under the gun two player who is a medium 
stack with 53 bigs and the cutoff player who is a  
short stack with only 10 bigs in this case the big 
stack versus the medium stack creates a 4.7 risk  
Advantage for the big stack player considering 
that their risk premium is only 4.7 percent while  
the medium stack has a risk premium against them 
of 9.4 that creates a 4.7 advantage in the case of  
the big stack versus the short stack the big stack 
has a risk premium of only 0.9 percent while the  
short stack has a risk premium against them of 
2.6 so that creates a 1.7 risk Advantage meaning  
the big stack has less opportunity to leverage 
the short stack than they do the medium stack  
well why is this it's simply because the Under 
the Gun 2 player here has roughly average stack  
that means their stack is quite valuable which 
means that the under the gun player the big stack  
has more ability to apply pressure to them and 
to leverage them because they have to preserve  
that stack to some degree by contrast the cutoff 
stack at only 10 big blinds is not very valuable  
now if we move on to a much more extreme example 
where we're near the bubble and the risk premiums  
start to get very very high in this context the 
average stack is about 40 big blinds and if we  
look at the under the gun player once again they 
now have a risk advantage of virtually 10 or more  
against anybody at this table because as you can 
see if you look at that first row on the graphic  
here the under the gun players risk premium 
against any player at this table is never jumping  
above five percent but everybody else against 
under the gun if you look at that left hand column  
everybody else has a risk premium of at least 12 
13 14 close to 15 in some instances against the  
under the gun player so this exact phenomenon 
is what creates those spots where a certain  
player gets to exploit the bubbles significantly 
by opening really wide and things like that it's  
the fact that this player can bust anybody in 
the event but nobody else at the table has a  
significant incentive to mix it up with under the 
gun and they can't exert as much pressure because  
under the gun can take much more risk against them 
than they can against under the gun now if we look  
at an example from after the bubble in this case 
a final three table spot you can see that the risk  
premiums have dropped significantly because 
we're through the bubble and under the gun's  
ability to pressure the stacks around them with 
their 100 big blind stack has massively reduced  
the under the gun's risk Advantage versus 
everybody here is cut approximately in half  
and you can see that the short stacks at the 
table have fairly small risk premiums as well  
so in this case because there's fewer pay jumps 
there's much less Jeopardy for the players  
who are shallow at this point there's much less 
ability for the big stack to apply pressure that's  
reflected in the change in the extent of the under 
the gun's risk Advantage here the middle Stacks  
still have to be very cautious or relatively 
cautious against under the gun but not to the  
extent that they did when we were approaching the 
Bobble and these risk premiums are then going to  
start ramping up again approaching the final table 
and the value of that under the gun 100 big blind  
stack is going to keep increasing as their risk 
advantage over the other players keeps increasing  
as well so now that you've seen what risk 
Advantage looks like I have a question for you  
pause the video if you need some time to 
think about your answer is the following  
statement true or false the average stack in the 
tournament does not affect risk Advantage only the  
stage of the tournament and the relationship 
between the active Stacks what do you think
[Music]
well the answer here is actually 100 false let me 
show you why so if we look at these two examples  
here let's focus on the 50 big blind stack and the 
20 big blind stack in these two scenarios where on  
the left the average is 40 big blinds and on the 
right the average is 20. so on the left the under  
the gun one player has a 50 big blind stack and 
the small blind has 20. in this case under the  
gun 1 has a risk premium against the small blind 
of 3.8 percent while the small blind versus Under  
the Gun 1 has a risk premium of 5.5 percent so 
in this case the under the gun one player has a  
risk advantage of 1.7 percent on the right hand 
side when 20 big blinds is the average stack we  
now have a scenario where the under the gun player 
with 50 big blinds has a 4.5 percent risk premium  
against the small blind who has 20 but the small 
blind has a 9.1 percent risk premium against the  
under the gun player creating a spot where where 
the under the gun player now has a 4.6 risk  
Advantage so on the left with 40 big blind average 
Stacks the advantage of a 50 versus a 20 big blind  
stack was about 1.7 but when average stack is 
20 big blinds what now happens is that 20 big  
blind stack in the small blind becomes much more 
valuable the small blind has a lot more incentive  
to just preserve that stack because there's a 
lot more short stacks at the table and in the  
tournament so the under the gun player with 50 big 
blinds even though the stacks haven't changed now  
has a much much bigger risk advantage in the spot 
on the right here simply because 20 big blinds is  
more valuable than it is when the average stack 
is 40. so that's an interesting spot that we can  
analyze here with all of this in mind it's time 
to dive into how risk Advantage actually affects  
strategy we don't really need to look at how 
it affects opening ranges since that equation  
is extremely simple the larger a player's risk 
Advantage versus the players left to act behind  
the more opportunity they have to why in their 
opening range Beyond whatever a chip EV range  
for their stack size would be so with that in 
mind let's go beyond opening ranges and focus  
our energy on two main areas how risk Advantage 
affects our initial response to an open raise and  
how it affects our response to a three bet first 
we'll tackle the situations where we ourselves  
have a reasonably significant risk advantage 
in this first scenario the cutoff with 110 big  
blinds is responding to an open from Under the Gun 
2 at 50 big blinds with 37 of the field remaining  
and in this case based on the risk premiums the 
cutoff has a one percent risk advantage and you  
can see that there's a small difference here in 
the ranges there is a certain amount more three  
betting with the suited Aces on the right hand 
side and there's also a little bit less flat  
calling on the right hand side as well with some 
of those speculative hands like some of the suited  
connector type hands so there's a little bit of 
an evolution in the ranges here and we'll talk  
about the extent of that a little bit more later 
on but there's not a massive change so far we're  
seeing a little bit less mixing a little bit less 
need for a balanced three betting range with but  
generally a one percent risk Advantage hasn't 
affected things too much just yet now in this  
next example we have the cut off at 100 big blinds 
reacting to the LoJack at 43 big blinds with 25  
percent of the field remaining so in this case as 
you can imagine the risk premiums are starting to  
ramp up as we get closer to the bubble and this 
is going to affect the output of the Sim in a much  
more significant way here right away when we have 
a 3.5 risk Advantage here you can see that our  
three bet range has become a lot more polarized 
you can see that the suited aces are now the bulk  
of our three bet Bluffs alongside a good chunk of 
the offsuit aces as well and what we're no longer  
doing is mixing a decent frequency of three bets 
with a lot of these middle suited hands like Jack  
10 suited King 10 suited and some of the suited 
connectors even we really have very little reason  
to three bet those hands now because it's a lot 
less important for us to have board coverage in  
our three bet range and ultimately our 3 Bet 
isn't going to get flatted very much to begin  
with considering that the opposing player has 
such a risk disadvantage that they're not going  
to Flat a lot of three bets which we'll come to 
talk about a bit more later but the fact that our  
three bet isn't going to get flattered very much 
means we don't need to have as much playability in  
our three bet range and therefore we can three-bit 
more polarized in the way that we are on the right  
hand side here now if we look at a more extreme 
example where we're at the final two tables and  
we have 150 big blinds in the small blind against 
a cut off open from a 60 big blind stack in this  
case we have a massive 10.5 percent risk advantage 
and as you can tell that's massively altering our  
strategy here right we have a lot less need for 
mixing a lot less need for board coverage so a lot  
of those middle suited hands suited Broadways that 
might choose two three bet here for the purpose  
of playing in a three-bet pot against certain 
dominated hands those have very little reason  
to three bet anymore and are heavily favoring flat 
calling our flat calling range is very condensed  
but it's also very wide where peeling hands as 
wide as five three suited here just because we  
have a lot of post-flop Leverage when we do call 
the polarized three betting range that you can see  
here is now including almost all the offsuit Aces 
and even a lot of the weak suited kings and queen  
means that are going to have enough blocking power 
over the hands that will flat the three bet or the  
hands that will format to justify three betting 
aggressively here so that 10.5 risk Advantage is  
massively helping us to three bet aggressively in 
this case and even hands like pocket eight sevens  
and sixes are three betting at a decent rate 
here and that is not necessarily because they're  
looking to get value from Flats because they're 
not getting flatted very much but it's more to do  
with their ability to deny Equity to a lot of the 
over card hands here that will be forced to just  
raise fold to a three bet and as you can see the 
offsuit Broadway hands are now doing a good chunk  
of three betting because they have a reasonable 
amount of blocking power against the hands that  
will format and flat so they're going to get more 
fold Equity as well so the huge risk Advantage  
here is creating a spot where we get to three bet 
a lot wider and much more polarized now let's move  
on to looking at some spots where our opponent 
has the risk advantage and see how our response  
against a race first in is going to change in this 
case we are the button with 55 big blinds versus  
a cutoff open from a 110 big blind stack with 37 
percent of the field remaining and as you can see  
there's a little bit of the same sort of dynamic 
here going on where our three bets have started  
to become more polarized even though we have a 
risk disadvantage but a pretty key function of  
our strategy change here is the fact that we're 
simply a lot tighter the hands like 10 7 suited  
Jack 8 suited eight seven seven six six five that 
were continuing at reasonable frequencies here in  
the pure chip EV spot on the left are now going 
to mostly fold when we have that risk disadvantage  
and our suited Aces and some of those off-suit 
hands and off suit aces are still our three  
bet Bluff hands but we have a lot less reason to 
speculate or to Flat with some of the bottom end  
of that Broadway range Jack 10 off is now high 
frequency fold Queen 10 off is some three bets  
but very few flat hats so we're just narrowing 
down our flatting range and we are starting to  
become a little bit more polar with our three bets 
but as you can see we still have a good chunk of  
three betting with king queen suited we have a 
little bit with Jack 10 Queen 10 10 9 stuff like  
that simply because we are still getting flattened 
Sometimes When We Three bet here now if we look  
at a spot where there's 25 of the field remaining 
and we're getting closer to the bubble and in this  
case we have a 4.4 percent risk disadvantage so 
our opponent opens under the gun too and 125 big  
blinds and we are in the cutoff with 37 big blinds 
now you can see that our response has massively  
tightened up we're now folding a lot of pocket 
pairs we're only flatting a very specific region  
of suited Broadways and in fact even though our 
three bet is going to get flatted sometimes and  
therefore we don't have to be quite as Polar in 
this spot the fact that we're up against Under  
the Gun 2 means that it's a little a bit harder 
for us to get some Thin value out of the opening  
range and you can see that the king nines King 
tens Queen Jacks Queen tens those are functioning  
as some of our three bet Bluffs here along with 
Ace jack off suit and some of the suited Aces but  
our ability to three bet with say ace 10 suited 
king queen suited get a little bit of thin value  
out of that opening range is drastically reduced 
here the king tens and King 9 suited are actually  
three betting mostly for the opportunity to get 
hands like King jack off suit to fold there so  
ultimately our risk disadvantage is forcing 
us to be tighter and we're still a little bit  
polar but we're using some of those hands that 
would otherwise flat like those weaker suited  
Broadways as our Bluffs now and we're folding a 
lot of those King eights Jack nines hands like  
that if we go to an even more extreme spot where 
the hijack opens off a 125 big blind stack at the  
final two tables and we're on the button with 
35 bigs clearly our response looked massively  
different from chippy V we now have a 9.7 risk 
this Advantage so our three bet is becoming even  
more polarized and Ace 10 off Ace jack off those 
types of hands start to become our best three bet  
Bluff candidates alongside some of the middling 
suited Aces and a few suited Kings as well  
the queen Jacks Queen 10 suited Jack 10 suited 
actually now become pretty reasonable frequency  
folds because we're forced to play so tight and I 
think this is the kind of spot where players are  
just not going to play this way in practice 
right I don't imagine people folding Jack 10  
suited to an open here I don't imagine people 
folding pocket eights at a small frequency to  
an open here so really noteworthy here that our 
response has become so tight in this case but we  
still have those three bet Bluffs with the King 
fives the king fours and the King 10 offs the ace  
10 offs hands like that I guarantee you the vast 
majority of people are not going to be able to  
recognize that King 4 suited is a partial three 
bet here while pocket eights is a partial fold  
that obviously doesn't seem to match up very well 
but it's all because of these risk premiums and  
the extent to which risk Advantage is influencing 
the strategies here next let's look at some spots  
where we're defending against a three bet and 
we'll start once again with the situations where  
we have a risk advantage in this first example 
we we open from the cut off at 110 big blinds  
and the button three bets off a 55 big blind stack 
with 37 of the field left and in this case we have  
about a 1.1 percent risk advantage and you can see 
a certain amount of what's Happening Here you can  
see that in the chippy Sim first of all we have a 
lot more jams against the three bet than we would  
in ICM so ICM is now making jamming less effective 
and we can achieve a fairly similar result with a  
non all in four bit so you can see the suited Aces 
from Ace 8 all the way down to ace deuce a lot of  
them are now four betting non-all in interestingly 
ace5 suited which is sort of the hand that most  
people would assume is the most likely format or 
four bet all-in type of a hand here especially in  
chippy V that hand is now actually flatting some 
instead of four by things their hand's almost  
strong enough to Flat here but the main thing here 
is that even with a risk Advantage we're still  
forced to tighten up because we do still have some 
kind of a risk premium against the button here and  
the main hands that we're tightening up with are a 
lot of these speculative hands like the middle Cod  
and low Cod suited hands these hands are just more 
easily dominated versus a tighter more polarized  
three betting range and we don't have as much 
opportunity to speculate profitably there this  
also goes for the low pocket pairs you can see 
that hands like fours Threes And even parts of  
fives are now folding to the three bet where they 
weren't doing so in chippy V the offsuit Broadways  
are also falling to the three bet here so the 
response is tight and it's shifting away from  
all in four bets and more towards a polarized 
non-all in four bet here as a response to the  
three bet now in this next case where we now 
have a 3.3 percent risk Advantage from the  
hijack versus a cut off three bet with 25 percent 
of the field remaining we're now once again still  
shifting away from jams and more towards non-all 
in four bets because the non-all in four bat is  
much more prevalent on the right than it is on 
the left but we do still have some jams except  
what's interesting now is that our flats are very 
restricted and our jams are actually coming from  
a lot of these king queen suited King Jack suited 
King 10 Queen Jack those types of hands that were  
perhaps previously a little bit more happy to 
just call and the reason here is that against  
a polarized three bet range which contains a lot 
of Aces we're now unblocking all of their three  
bet folds and we're also putting ourselves in 
a position where because their Free Bet range  
is so polarized to begin with the EV that we 
capture by flatting is greatly reduced we're  
often going to be up against hands that are 
very weak and won't put a lot of money into  
the pot post flop anyway once we flat and then the 
strong portion the Asus kings queens Etc just has  
us dominated with a lot of those hands so we now 
shift into a scenario where jamming and forcing  
folds from those Bluffs is actually a little bit 
more beneficial than flatting here so even with a  
3.3 percent risk Advantage we're now shifting away 
from flatting and more towards jamming now in this  
next case where we now have a 9.7 risk Advantage 
we are once again up against a button who's three  
betting about 35 big blanks deep and we're in the 
final two tables scenario once again and you can  
see the these two ranges look wildly different 
here the chip EV range has us doing a good amount  
of flatting and then a certain amount of jamming 
the ICM range has us still jamming a fair amount  
but leaning even more heavily into some non-all in 
four Bets with a slightly perhaps confusing range  
of some king queen off some ACE 10rface Knight off 
blocker type hands and then some Queens plus an  
Ace King for Value but also a little bit of nines 
and eights presumably for a little bit of equity  
denial and then two sort of reluctantly call off 
against the jam the bottom line here is that the  
calling has massively reduced that even when we 
are the covering player by a huge distance here  
and we have a huge risk Advantage the polarized 
nature of our pollen's three betting range means  
that we no longer really have much incentive to 
be peeling that three bet from out of position  
so that's a very common Trend that we're going 
to see here even when we have a risk Advantage  
but what about when we don't have a risk Advantage 
what about when we're facing a three bet and our  
opponent has a risk Advantage well this is a 
tricky scenario because we're facing a three  
bet from a player who has leverage over us so 
it's obviously not easy to know how to respond  
let's take a look in this case we as the Under the 
Gun 2 opener face a three bet from the cutoff who  
has 110 big blinds and we have 50. so with 37 of 
the field remaining we have about a one percent  
risk disadvantage here and as you can see that's 
already starting to affect our response quite a  
bit we're flatting a lot less our flatting range 
is basically some bits and pieces of the middle  
pocket Pairs and then king queen suited Ace Queen 
suited and Ace Jack suited there's really almost  
nothing else in our flattening range here even 
with 37 of the field remaining our opportunity  
to Flat three bets out of position against players 
who greatly cover us is massively reduced so big  
change to our strategy here already then if we 
increase the extent of our risk disadvantage  
we're looking at a spot now where we have a 4.6 
risk disadvantage once again flatting has almost  
disappeared from our strategy but we're now now 
in a position where we do have the ability to  
start jamming again and as you can see it's a lot 
of those suited Broadways that were flatting that  
are now jamming and we have a polarized non-all in 
format with some of those suited Aces serving as  
our Bluffs and the very top of our range also 
obviously four betting a bit smaller but main  
thing here is that calling is disappearing 
particularly with those speculative hands  
that risk premium that's placed on us here means 
speculation just isn't really going to function  
very well and of course when we have a significant 
risk disadvantage that's also going to be true  
however what's now happening is something quite 
interesting it's that the three bet range from  
the button here has now become so wide that we 
actually start to do a bit more flatting again and  
it's simply because even though the risk premium 
is quite High hands like Ace 10 suited Ace Jack  
suited have so much EV that they can capture 
by being way ahead of all the dominated asex  
off-suit Bluffs that the button has here that they 
actually now gain the ability to Flat a bit more  
so once our opponent's range becomes so wide and 
so aggressive there is a little bit of Merit to  
flatting with some of these hands that have decent 
playability but as you can see we also have quite  
a lot of jams and a lot of those pocket pairs 
are mixing flats and jams so the EV is going to  
be very very close there one way or the other the 
bottom line here is that the only thing that makes  
flatting slightly more viable is if our opponent 
is just really going nuts with three bets and  
that's only really going to be true in situations 
where we have a significant risk disadvantage here  
so that's a really interesting aspect to this 
concept but what about when the risk Advantage  
is somewhat neutral well let's start by looking 
at some spots where neither player really has a  
significant risk advantage and the risk premiums 
are not especially high in the early stages if  
neither player has a significant risk advantage 
and risk premiums are low we're just in a spot  
where we're very close to chip EV so there's not 
really too much need to actually look at that in  
this case we have a spot with the hijack opening 
off of 55 big blinds and the cut off having 53  
in response we have about 37 of the field 
remaining and both players have a 4.8 percent risk  
premium in this particular spot you can see that 
the response on the right hand side here is more  
polar because there is that risk premium placed 
on the hijack but it looks a little bit like the  
spot where we had a slight risk Advantage here 
we're already shifting more polar we're getting  
more folds to the three bet we have less reason 
to three bet linearly we have less reason to try  
to get some Thin value out of some of those 
hands that might previously have done so but  
the overall consistency of the three bet range 
hasn't changed a ton here it's just really the  
middle suited hands that are now shifting out 
of three betting and actually just starting to  
fold and the suited aces are three betting at a 
slightly higher rate so it's not a massive shift  
in strategy here this next spot takes us into the 
hijack's response against that cut off three bet  
so this is the same spot where both players have 
a 4.8 risk premium and what's happening here one  
once again is that we're now seeing a shift away 
from jamming and we're seeing a polarized non-all  
in format with a block a heavy range of suited 
Aces and then we're seeing very little flatting  
so when risk Advantage is somewhat neutral 
here it basically creates a similar scenario  
to where the outer position player has a risk 
disadvantage where they just really don't have  
a lot of incentive to Flat the three bet is 
more polarized it's a lot harder to play out  
of position against that range so it's uh very 
tricky to justify a lot of flacking here and if  
we look at a spot where risk Advantage is neutral 
but the risk premiums are a lot higher things are  
going to get interesting as well in this case we 
have a scenario at the final two tables where the  
LoJack opens off of 40 big blinds and the cutoff 
is responding and this is a really interesting  
one because both players have a roughly 12 percent 
risk premium against the other here right and that  
creates a scenario where one player the cutoff in 
this case does have a 0.7 percent risk Advantage  
technically but that's not a big enough advantage 
to really have affect the situation very much  
here instead we can consider it a risk neutral 
spot in a situation where the risk premiums are  
very very high and you can immediately see what's 
happened to the response from the cut off here on  
the right they have a good chunk of flatting now 
but it's very very condensed it's Jacks through  
sixes suited Broadways and not really much 
else and their three bet is highly polarized  
to essentially just ace blockers and some King 
blockers and they're three but for Value range  
is so so thin their value three bet here is about 
two-thirds of pocket queens and then Kings plus  
and Ace King and that's about it there's very very 
little that they're able to three bet for Value so  
those hands there on the left were three betting 
for Value like Jacks tens some pocket nines some  
little bits of some other hands here those hands 
have almost no incentive to three bet for value  
now because they cannot stack off with that high 
of a risk premium so in this case the flatting  
option is actually slightly better even though 
there's a high risk premium on there and we're  
really just going to get to realize some Equity 
post flop the cutoff and low Jack aren't going  
to be able to play that aggressively against each 
other here because they both have such high risk  
premiums so we're just going to do a lot of 
passive post-flop play and that's going to  
be better than three betting hand like Jax and 
being in a nightmare spot here now if we look  
at the lojax response to that cut off three bet 
again it's going to be drastically different from  
Chip ev even though they're only at a small risk 
disadvantage here it's effectively risk neutral  
and what's basically happening is that they're 
doing almost no Flats Ace Queen suited is the only  
hand that has any reasonable flattening frequency 
here or any significant flattening frequency and  
they're shifting basically to playing Jam or fold 
and even hands like kings or Queens they have such  
little ability to get thin value from a small 
full bet here that they benefit mostly just from  
denying Equity being all in and hoping for the 
best so it's specifically Aces and Ace King suited  
that are actually Four betting small here which is 
obviously a very very specific very narrow range  
so again flatting basically disappears here 
because the risk premiums are so high and now  
we're facing a three bet which is a larger portion 
of chips to uh to deal with next let's move into  
looking a little bit at some multi-way Dynamics 
and how this is going to affect some multi-way  
spots in this first example we have a five percent 
risk advantage in the big blind where the 125 big  
blinds facing a low Jack open from a 61 big blind 
stack and a button call from a 69 big blind stack  
with 25 of the field remaining now as you can see 
our response is still fairly wide our continuing  
frequency is still fairly High we're still able to 
call with a lot of suited hands but a lot of the  
offsuit portion that doesn't realize Equity very 
well is just folding and what's in particular very  
interesting here is that we're slightly shifting 
away from squeezing as a bluff with some of those  
suited Broadways that wanted to do it on the left 
hand side you can see the Jack tens the queen 10  
King 10 they're fairly high frequency squeezes on 
the left but they're much lower frequencies on the  
right and instead on the right we're now squeezing 
where the more polarized range of suited Ace  
blockers High Cod low card hands like even Queen 
do suited some of the other metal suited Queens  
are now bluffing a lot so our Bluff selection 
has slightly changed our range has become much  
more polarized because again we're going to get 
flattered a lot less um but we've basically just  
tightened up we've tightened up we've become more 
polar and we no longer really are as concerned  
with having playability in our squeezing range 
so we don't need to have as many of the suited  
Broadways in there uh instead we're perfectly 
content to just have a weaker suited and because  
we're not getting flatted very much and in the 
next example as you can see the big blind has 40  
big blinds under the gun opens off 90 and hijacked 
Flats off 100 with 25 remaining and in this case  
our response is wildly different to chip EV we're 
now much much tighter uh it looks more like a a  
four-way or a five-way response here where we're 
focusing on flatting a lot of the middle to low  
suited hands even some of the lower off suit 
hands and it's certainly very intuitive here  
that we would fold Queen jack off suit at a high 
rate but call 5-4 off suit almost in pure that  
certainly is not very intuitive but it's really 
just to do with Equity realization and the types  
of board textures on which we are going to flop 
very strongly here so our multi-way response here  
with a roughly three percent risk disadvantage 
against both players is actually substantially  
Tighter and we are still three betting some of 
those suited Broadways but now it's really mostly  
for Bluff power and blocking potential more so 
than wanting to get some some Thin value but we do  
have to have a little bit more playability in that 
squeezing range when the fact that both players  
have us covered significantly means they have 
a little bit more ability to Flat The Squeeze  
here but also note that we're not doing any all-in 
jamming we have a little bit of all in jamming at  
40 big blinds in the chip EV version of this Sim 
but there's none of it now in the ICM version now  
that we've looked at all these different examples 
let's bring it all back together and discuss the  
overall shift and strategy we can observe when 
we incorporate not just risk premium but risk  
Advantage into our understanding of tournament 
poker spots firstly when we have the risk  
Advantage here the changes in our strategy first 
of all we're going to respond to arrays first in  
with a wider range and a more polar three bet now 
this doesn't necessarily mean wider than chippy V  
it's very rare that we can go wider than chip EV 
but it is going to be wider than what we would if  
we did not have the risk Advantage our three bets 
are going to be primarily driven by a lot of the  
weaker suited Ace and suited King hands as well as 
a lot of the off-suit ace hands are going to three  
bet at a decent frequency our call response is 
going to be fairly moderate and pretty against a  
lot of those middle strength hands we're not going 
to need to mix a lot of three bets with those  
suited Broadways because our three bet is not 
going to get flattened as much so we really don't  
need to have as much playability in a three-bet 
pot and we also aren't going to get as much thin  
value in that sense either our response against 
the three bet is going to be very aggressive here  
when we have a lower risk Advantage we're going to 
have a pretty condensed call range but we do still  
have the ability to call sometimes when we have 
a much higher risk Advantage we don't really need  
to do very much calling and instead we can just 
capitalize on the efficiency of 4-bet jamming or  
formatting small to really apply pressure to 
the three better here particularly with that  
very block a heavy range and finally when we're 
multi-way we're still going to be fairly tight  
just because the caller now has a much tighter 
range so when two players are potentially risk  
disadvantaged against some of the rest of the 
players left to act behind it's gonna be a  
slightly tighter open slightly tighter calling 
range so we do have to be more mindful of that  
and we have to be less willing to just speculate 
with off suit hands and we also don't need to have  
as much board coverage in our squeezing range 
as well and what about when we have a risk  
disadvantage well in these cases we're going to 
have a much tighter response and a slightly less  
polar 3 Bet versus arrays considering that the 
value of calling with some of these potential  
mixing hands is going to go down but three betting 
now does get us a little bit more linear value or  
thin value from some of these hands because our 
three bet does get flattened sometimes so when our  
opponent has us covered and we do get flattered 
we actually do benefit a little bit from some  
more playability in three bet pots and therefore 
we can three bet some of these King Queens King  
Jack suited stuff like that a bit more easily the 
implied odds of pocket Pairs and suited connectors  
are going to go way down in these spots we're 
going to have very little opportunity to call  
speculatively or to just try to flop a strong hand 
so we're gonna have to be folding a lot of those  
low pocket pairs here in a lot of spots and we're 
going to have a very very tight response versus a  
three bet for the most part we're gonna do a lot 
of folding we're not going to do a ton of jamming  
we're going to do some small full betting where we 
can and the Paradox here that does occur is when  
our risk disadvantage is super high when it's 9 
10 12 something like that and that's not just the  
risk premium it's the risk disadvantage so when we 
have a very valuable stack and our opponent has us  
covered by a lot the three bet is now so wide that 
we actually start flattening a bit more so you saw  
in those examples where we went to the final two 
tables you saw that there were some very high risk  
premiums some significant risk advantages being 
developed but there was also a little bit more  
flatting against the three bets simply because 
the three bet was so wide and finally when we're  
in multi-way spots here with a risk disadvantage 
particularly if we have a disadvantage against  
both players our range gets pretty much cut in 
half we have to be a lot tighter we don't get to  
do as much squeezing and a lot of the hands that 
might flat just to realize Equity multi-way are  
no longer going to have reason to do that simply 
because we are at such a disadvantaged post-flop  
and finally when nobody has a risk Advantage 
you can kind of observe that our response versus  
arrays first in range is a tighter version of a 
gpv strategy our weakest calling hands in chip  
EV are going to fold we're going to do a lot less 
speculative calling our implied odds go down our  
response against the three bet with this scenario 
is going to pretty much have the same Dynamics  
some pairs are going to start folding the suited 
aces are going to start to prefer 4-bet bluffing  
ahead of just calling the three bet and then 
as the risk premium on both players is going  
to increase our three bet is going to become more 
and more polarized and we're going to have almost  
no flatting versus our opponent's three bet again 
because they three bet more polarized but they're  
not quite wide enough yet for us to have a little 
bit more Equity so that's about it for this video  
I hope you've enjoyed our deep dive into this 
New Concept I like to think of it as a way of  
mathematically defining our capacity to exert ICM 
pressure over our opponents in any given spot one  
other aspect that is very exciting about this Con 
concept is it can also be applied to post-flop  
scenarios and I look forward to being able to 
explore this in some detail once GTO Wizards  
post-flop ICM Sims are available in the GTO 
wizard archive at some point in the future so  
with that said if you have any questions or 
clarifications that you need from this video  
feel free to put the comments down below and 
you can also find me on the GTO wizard Discord  
server I'll be happy to discuss the concepts 
in this video otherwise thank you everybody for  
watching I will be back again soon with another 
video for you guys and good luck to everybody
