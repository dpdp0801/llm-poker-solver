### TOPIC: gto analysis
what's up guys this is tom for gto
wizard in the spirit of halloween we've
prepared some spooky gto analysis for
you we're gonna review two hands that
put us in some scary spots followed by
an in-depth look at the gto strategy
behind them let's jump right in
[Music]
this first hand starts off with
queen two suited in the big blind
cutoff opens
recall
flop comes four four deuce rainbow
cut off bets third part and we call
the turn queen of hearts upgrades our
two pair to a three pair which is really
just a queen with no kicker
and the cutoff bets 75 pot we make the
call
the turn jack of hearts completes the
backdoor flush draw and they shove
over four times the pot what are we
supposed to do here hearts beat us
boats beat us trips beat us heck even a
better queen beats us
and yet
we should make this call
why is that
let's take a look at the gto analysis
so cut off opens
call in the big blind with this range
lop comes 4 4 deuce rainbow and this is
an interesting texture i think most
players would categorize this as quite a
dry flop and that's because everything
missed
right if we take a look at the ranges
tab
we can compare the hands breakdown
between both ranges
we can see that
over 80 percent of both ranges are just
over cards it's just air
trash
however because there's no high cards on
the board all of these over cards are
competing to outdraw each other and this
actually makes this type of texture very
dynamic and we notice there's a small
donking range here up 13 what's going on
with that
let's go look at the equity buckets and
i want to observe the nut advantage
and look at this equity distribution
graph
now we have a small nut advantage near
the top and this is mostly owing to
the fact that we have more trips we
defend with more forex than they open in
the cutoff however they have a big range
advantage throughout and that's simply
because
their over cards
are stronger than our over cards
so we check
and cut off it's not range betting here
but they bet small and betting small is
quite common compared boards and single
raised pots
the reason for that is they don't need a
big bit to target our air right they're
not trying to fold us off a made hand
here they're targeting king high they're
targeting
nine seven suited queen 10 off type of
stuff what stands out to me is just how
much it's check raising care over 20 of
the time and that's owing to this
dynamic board texture you can see even
queen 2 does play as a raise quite
frequently in general you want to be
raising with hands that have good
backdoor potential such as 3x or 5x
backdoor flush draw backdoor straight
draw
gut shots
hands like that
so we call
we turn
a queen of hearts
now the queen of hearts
very sad card for us
right we're not really defending that
many queens we even raised some of them
flop if we take a look at the turn
reports
what i'm going to do here is
we're going to sort
all the possible turn cards by ev
we can see
top here this is our ev hence the
queen's not a great turn card for us but
it's an excellent turn card for the
cutoff why is that
that's because
cutoff
is betting lots of queen x
whereas
we're not calling that much queen x in
fact we'd much rather have seen an ace
because we actually have an advantage
in the ace cards so queen of hearts
we're going to range check this
and cut off splits their strategy
they've got anywhere between a block bet
and an over bet in this spot many
different viable options now the 75
percent is on the more polarized side of
what they can do
they're mainly doing this with stuff
like top pair some over pairs
various draws flush draws gut shots and
such when they bet 75 we can already see
that
we're put in a pretty
tough spot
most of our range is getting close to
indifferent here you can see the
polarization in that they have all these
strong hands weaker hands whereas we
have more bluff catchers
queen two again it does have the option
to raise here but most of the range
prefers a call when they polarize like
this so we call
see a jack of hearts river
jack of hearts is uh that's an
interesting river because
what it does is it completes all the
backdoor flush draws which evens out the
advantages a bit we can see here
it's not really clear who has the
advantage
on this river i mean we have more bluff
catchers near the bottom that's because
they polarized
they have a small nut advantage
however if we take a look
at the hands breakdown they have more
boats
quads we have more flushes what this
means is that their strongest value can
polarize over our strongest value
and that's why once we check
they have
a shoving range here this is what
enables them to get away with this
massive size we can see the breakdown
here about
22 percent boats 30 flushes
a lot of the rest of it is just air very
polarizing so when they shove
we're not happy
right
so we take a look here
i'm going to change this over to ranges
again and just pay attention
to this equity distribution
everything along this line here
is very close to indifferent
you need about 44 45 to call this
massive over bet and most of our range
sits right on that line
blushes
not too happy
trips
very sad top pair
not doing great
right
in fact even our ace 10 even
the nut flush
is mixing in folds here second not flush
very close to a pure fold a range is not
happy but there does seem to be one or
two combos that are calling in full that
aren't the nuts one of them is queen
deuce
suited that's that's pretty wild
i think the more advanced players will
note that we have good blockers but
let's take a look at that why does queen
2 have good blockers here we have to
jump back to cutoffs shoving range
what i'm going to do is i'm going to
filter
just want to look at what they're
shoving with
i'm going to change this to range just
to make it a little easier to see
i'm going to do is i'm going to apply
these equity bucket filters i want to
see what their value range is
so we can see here that they're shoving
with twos fours jacks queens and the nut
flush her value and queen two blocks a
pretty big chunk of that value range
right block queens and twos what about
their bluffs
what about their worst hats well i mean
they're bluffing with
asex king x off suit with heart blockers
some other king x suited but we'll note
that queen and ii
do not interact with this bluffig range
at all
so
what that tells us is we block
actually a huge portion of their value
and unblock all of their bluffs for that
reason
queen 2 is going to have higher equity
than most of the rest of our range
let's take a look nut flush 44
what about trips how's uh how's 6'4
doing about 44
queen 2 on the other hand 46
that's
the power of blockers we can see it's
one of our few plus ev calls
very scary spot
obviously
a great call if anyone could find it all
right let's take a look at the next hand
in this next hand we have five two of
clubs in the big blind small blind opens
and we call flop comes eight five three
rainbow okay not a bad flop for us we've
got second pair some good back doors and
we've bet three times the pot what okay
we call
all right four of diamonds puts a few
straights out there we turned an open
ender there's some good flush draws and
they've shoved and they've shoved wow
what do we do in this spot got an open
ender got a pair do we make this call
yes
why is that
let's take a look at the gto analysis
now most people don't give their solvers
300 pot over bets so i've switched to
the complex solutions which have many
more sizes small blind opens big blind
calls and we get 853 rainbow
surprisingly this massive over bet is
actually the preferred size i'm just
going to graph that to make it easier to
see
wow
okay that's very strange let's take a
look at the ranges
and compare we can see that small blind
does have the nut advantage
14 to 2.5 but these nutted hands are all
quite vulnerable over pairs 8x
these hands can be outdrawn quite easily
now in order to have a massive overbet
your opponent can't have too many made
nutted hands and if we just filter by
two pair plus we can see that only about
two percent of each range is two pair
plus
okay
what if
they just bet a normal size what if they
just bet something like one third what
are we doing
if they just bet
something human
well we're not folding uh mdf would have
us fold something like 22 percent versus
this size we're massively under folding
and the reason is everything somewhat
connects with this board everything is a
backdoor straight or a back door flush
or over cards
pair plus straw in fact it doesn't even
matter what size you pick we are over
calling this board against every size
like 115 we should be folding something
like
a little over half the time we're over
calling 10
that's true regardless of what size you
pick in fact
take a look at the reports
and say
i'll pick 38 this time
what is the least folded
flop it's eight five three right
we pick some random 63 what's the least
folded flop
one of the least folded flops out of
1755 so
what do you do when you have a bunch of
vulnerable value hands
and your opponent
is just going to overcall with a ton of
backdoor equity against you well
you size up and apparently you size up a
lot so they make it
300
okay what are we doing against this size
i always think it's useful to find
thresholds in these situations
what hands are we folding uh we can see
that
even some top pair is folding here so
king eight queen eights ten eight nine
eight off these hands are all folding
and the reason is
that for one thing these hands are
already dominated
by their ace eight
which is a big part of the value range
the other thing is these hands can't
really
out draw the value range as effectively
but a hand like five two particularly
five two with a back door flush draw
this hand has a lot of back door equity
a lot of routes to outdraw nines plus
and ace eight we can hit a five we can
hit a two we can hit uh back door hard
back doors club we can hit ace a six or
tons of different ways we can make a
draw here on the turn and that's
important when your opponent is
polarizing this hard it's not about raw
hand strength it's about how can i out
draw their value range so similarly
you'll see sixes and sevens have very
few outs comparatively
so even though they're technically a
stronger hand they're folding here okay
you'll notice we don't have any raises
here so we make the call
four of diamonds
so we turn a four of diamonds and at
this point the small blind has a
decision to make
do they want to give up they want to
drag this out to the river using a
smaller size or do they just want to get
the chips in now and a portion of their
range just wants to shove
that's mainly going to be their over
pairs
and they're balancing that with some gut
shots and open enders
so
they ship it
action's on us what are we calling with
here
well we're giving up with you know some
nines are giving up
8x is giving up a lot of our second and
third pairs giving up even hands like
jack three of diamonds is giving up five
deuce five deuce is calling and
this is mainly due to the fact that you
don't block too many of their bluffs and
that your outs are clean right any deuce
five ace or six will allow us to outdraw
their value range and when you're in
these very polarized spots that's what's
important it's not about raw hand
strength it's not about i have a combo
draw so i call it's about
i need to be able to outdraw their value
unblock their bluffs
that's what gives this hand enough
equity to call
and see we have 40 percent here whereas
it had like king three of diamonds only
as 37
queen eight off only 35 38 so this is
one of the few plus cv bluff catchers we
actually have
in our range
