### TOPIC: poker math every player needs to know
welcome to Poker math 101 in today's 
video we're going to discuss the poker  
math that every player needs to know 
you don't need to be a mathematician  
or a genius but if you want to succeed 
at poker you need to have a grasp on  
these basic mathematical principles 
that guide your strategy let's dive
in before we start the video we' really appreciate 
it if you could hit the like And subscribe buttons  
your support means a lot to us thank you and 
enjoy the video let's start with a question  
what do these five things have in common prop 
bets pot odds minimum defense frequency Alpha and  
value to Bluff ratios most coaching material out 
there will teach you that these are five separate  
things they all have their own equations they all 
represent different concepts blah blah blah but  
they all share one thing in common what is that 
the answer is that they can all be expressed as  
a simple risk reward calculation in fact to me 
these aren't five different things this is one  
thing expressed five different ways in today's 
video I'm going to equip you with a powerful  
mathematical tool that you can use used to solve 
a wide variety of different poker math spots very  
easily and intuitively we're first going to cover 
why this matters we'll help you build intuition  
so that you're not memorizing formulas rather 
you are building this from an intuitive place  
then I want to teach you the basic risk reward 
calculations how you can use those in things like  
expected value Edge Break Even calculations Etc 
and along the way we're going to have interactive  
quizzes to help drill this knowledge home so why 
does this matter I mean at its heart poker is a  
game of intuition it's a game of guesswork but 
you need something to guide your intuition and  
this math guides it right for example if you're 
calling a bet you need to have some idea of how  
often your call needs to work to succeed even 
if you don't know your exact Equity you need  
to have some idea of okay it needs to work 20% 
of the time or oh crap it needs to work a lot  
more often than that math is also very useful in 
off table analysis reviewing your hand histories  
reviewing your play and building that intuition 
during your study time it helps you ask the right  
question so if you don't know how to reframe this 
in terms of the basic mathematics that guide your  
strategy then you don't know how to ask the 
right questions about your own strategy or  
how to improve most importantly risk and reward 
weight your incentives if you don't understand  
how these waiting work then you don't understand 
the incentives of your play let's build up your  
intuition you're getting 3 to one on a call how 
often do you need to win to break even right now  
this problem seems kind of abstract if you're 
familiar with poker math you might know the  
answer but let's break this down to something 
a little more fundamental let's reframe the  
question in terms of concrete objects that you can 
understand a gin and tonic recipe uses three parts  
tonic to one part gin what percentage of the 
drink is gin hopefully just by looking at this  
you can see oh one out of four is gin therefore 
25% of this drink is Jin right and this is just  
another way of saying there are three times as 
much tonic as there is gin therefore 25% in and  
this is just how you transform a ratio into a 
percentage right all right so let's go back to  
our previous example you're getting 3 to one on 
a call how often do you need to win to break even  
okay well we imagine three plus dollar signs and 
one minus dollar sign all this means is that the  
reward is three times greater than the risk so 
to break even you need to win one in four times  
or 25% we'll try another example you wager $100 
against your friends $400 that there will be an  
ace on the flop so if there's an ace on the Flop 
you gain 400 but if there's no Ace on the Flop you  
have to pay your friend 100 how often do have to 
flop an ace to break even okay at the moment this  
seems a little vague but let's reframe it in terms 
of something more concrete a basket contains four  
green apples and one red apple what percentage 
of apples are red in this basket well hopefully  
just by looking at this picture you can say well 
it's one in five apples 20% there are four green  
apples for every one red apple 1 over 1 + 4 and 
1/5 is 20% so you can just think of it in terms  
of simple things like this right going back to 
the previous question it's your 400 against their  
100 how often do you have to flop an ace well 
you're getting 400 to 100 or 4 to1 therefore  
you need to get an ace at least 20% of the time 
to break even now for a quick quiz is this a  
profitable bet will you make money or lose money 
doing this take a moment to consider your answer
well if we use GTO Wizards reports we can see that 
ASI flops actually occur 21.7% of the time so this  
is a profitable bet because you're going to flop 
an ace more than 20% of the time risk and reward  
ratios are to me the most fundamental equation 
in gambling they answer a huge number number of  
Poker math questions throughout this video we'll 
be referencing a term called implied probability  
or the break even point and this is just a fancy 
way of saying how often does the thing need to  
happen for the BET to be fair in our previous 
example if the ace flopped exactly 20% of the  
time no one has the edge it's exactly a fair 
Break Even bet and whenever you ask something  
like what are the pot ODS in poker or what's 
the bluffing frequency all of these things  
can be expressed as just calculating the break 
even Point once you know this Break Even points  
you can then start to estimate whether the thing 
happens more or less often than that and there's  
how you start building your intuition let's 
start with a breakdown so the way we express  
stuff as odds is reward colon risk you're getting 
three to one you're getting five to one all this  
means is here's the reward it is this much 
bigger or smaller than the risk it's a ratio  
right that's how you express something as odds in 
order to convert this to a percentage we use this  
formula first of all risk is what we stand to 
lose when we're unsuccessful reward is what we  
stand to gain when we are successful the implied 
probability or break even points is risk divided  
by risk Plus reward which is just how you convert 
the odds at the top of this page to a percentage  
to the implied probability you can also use this 
to calculate the expected value of something so  
if you want to know exactly how much money you 
expect to make well you can just multiply what  
you think the win percentage will be times the 
reward subtract the lose percentage times the  
risk EV equals that equation right there again 
you can understand basically all of Poker math  
if you understand basic risk reward calculations 
let's see an example and really drill this home  
we'll start with pod ODS the most common one 
and pod ODS fundamentally asks what is the risk  
reward of calling so if you're facing some 
bet the risk is that you call and lose the  
amount you called the reward what you stand 
to gain is the pot and their bet if I give  
you this and I say okay you're on the river in 
the big blind here button is just bet 2.7 into  
5.4 so they've made a half pot bet what are big 
blind's pot ODS could you figure it out take a
moment all right let's walk through it remember 
we're trying to calculate the break even point of  
calling the risk is 2.7 so we call and lose we 
stand to lose 2.7 big blinds the reward is how  
much we gain if we win so we call we gain their 
bets of 2.7 big blinds and the existing pot of  
5.4 big blinds for a total of 8.1 the PO odds 
or the break even point of calling could then  
be expressed as risk divided by risk Plus reward 
or more succinctly this fraction which comes out  
to 25% which is exactly what you expect for a 
half pot BET right but you may have seen pot  
odds expressed as a ratio instead so we know that 
okay they need to win 25% of the time but what if  
I asked you this question differently what if I 
said okay here's the reward and the risk calculate  
it big blind is getting 3 to one right or 8.1 to 
2.7 the reward is three times greater than the  
risk because you get a full pot and a half pot bet 
if you win and you lose a half pot bet if you lose  
so 3 to one risk divided by risk Plus reward 
we can convert this from odds to percentages  
again just using this equation you need to win 
25% of the time and finally we can express this  
as an expected value equation so maybe you don't 
just want to figure out the break even percentage  
you want to know hey exactly how much money am I 
going to make if I win let's say 30% of the time  
20% give me some exact numbers well you can plug 
this into an eveve equation pretty easily again  
we know the risk we know the reward therefore we 
can plug it into a simple EV equation here's how  
often we win times the amount we win subtract how 
often we lose times the amount we lose plug this  
in and there you go so you can plug in any win 
and lose percent that you like and figure out the  
exact expected value of calling now remember if we 
set the expected value of calling to zero then big  
blind will win 25% of the time or in other words 
if we set the win percentage to 25% and the lose  
percentage to 75 well then the expected value of 
calling is exactly zero or put another way it is  
a break even call so fundamentally the takeaway 
here is that pod odds is just asking you to find  
the break even win percentage when you call that's 
all it is right so you understand pod odds but do  
you understand value to Bluff ratios a very handy 
trick to know is that the bluffing percentage on  
the river so how often someone should be bluffing 
is just equal to the pot odds that they're laying  
similarly the value percentage is just one minus 
this amount now keep in mind this is only on the  
River on flop and turn value to Bluff ratios kind 
of compound I have a whole other video about that  
called Leverage go check that out if you want to 
learn how this stuff works on earlier streets but  
on the river anyway we can pretty easily express 
well hey they ought to be bluffing this often  
because here's the podt odds they're laying let me 
try an example we'll go back to the previous one  
button has bet 2.7 into 5.4 so they've made a half 
pot bet how often should they be bluffing on the
river imagine that you in the big blind have 
a bluff catcher you beat all of their Bluffs  
but lose to all their value bets well if you're 
exactly breaking even that would mean you have  
25% % Equity right because that would mean that 
they're bluffing 25% of the time so you know the  
break even bluffing frequency as the big blind you 
could then start to think oh there's no way they  
have 25% Bluffs here or oh they're definitely 
bluffing more than a quarter of the time here  
you can start to rephrase it in terms of these key 
thresholds and start thinking about your strategy  
let's talk about Alpha next Alpha describes the 
risk reward of bluffing imagine you put in some  
pure Bluff on the river how often does it need 
to work in order for you to break even the risk  
of bluffing is that they'll call you and then you 
just lose whatever amount you bluffed the reward  
what you stand to gain is the pot and this happens 
whenever they fold so let's calculate the alpha of  
this spot here you're in the big blind you've just 
put in six and a half so you've overb the pot into  
a five big blind pot how often do you need small 
blind to fold in order for your bluff to break
even
well we know we're trying to calculate Alpha we 
know our risk is the amount we bluffed 6 and2 we  
know the reward what we stand to gain is the pot 
five big blinds we know how to calculate a break  
even percentage that's just risk divided by risk 
Plus reward yes it's the same formula as pot odds  
again and we can just plug this in and figure out 
hey in order for our Bluff to break even we need  
them to fold 57% of the time if they fold more 
than that hey we're making money if they fold  
less than that ouch we're losing money but how 
much are we making or losing exactly well let's  
find out we can also plug this in to an expected 
value equation so the expected value of bluffing  
again we know the risk we know the reward it's 
the win percentage times the reward subtract the  
lose percentage times the risk if you want to 
figure out exactly how much money you're going  
to make and you have some estimates for win and 
lose percentage well you can plug this in now in  
the case of bluffing you win whenever they fault 
and you lose whenever they call so I'm going to  
replace those terms and then we'll plug in the 
reward and the risk and from here you can plug  
in whatever percentages you like and you'll notice 
that if we plug in the break even percentage the  
expected value of bluffing becomes zero but 
if you think they're folding more than that  
well now we're making money if they fold less than 
that well now we're losing money so again if you  
understand risk and reward you understand Alpha 
and you understand how to calculate the EV of a  
bluff EV of bluff equals z when small blind folds 
57% of the time let's talk about minimum defense  
frequency MDF is your Shield against bluffers 
it's how you prevent people from running you  
over and exploiting You by over bluffing so 
how often do we have to call to prevent our  
opponent from profitably bluffing well wait 
isn't this what we just calculated it is MDF  
is just 1 minus Alpha and Alpha is just 1 minus 
MDF so going back to our previous example if we  
want to calculate how often small blind should 
defend or the MDF of small blind in this spot  
how wide they should defend well okay we already 
know the alpha it's 57% therefore MDF is one minus  
that number or 43% small blind should defend 
at least 43% of the time now they can defend  
through calls or raises but all that matters 
is that they're folding no more than 57% cuz  
if they fold more than 57% of the time then big 
blind has a profitable Bluff with any two cards  
so knowing that key Break Even point is crucial 
to determining whether or not you're going to  
have a profitable Bluff or how often you ought 
to defend to prevent your opponent from having  
a profitable Bluff and as usual it can all be 
expressed as a simple risk reward calculation  
all right so you probably think you have a 
handle on the basics now let's put that to the  
test we're going to put all of these Concepts 
you've just learned together into one example  
in this spot the pot is five big blinds on the 
river big blind checks small blind bets 2 and  
a half into that pot and big blind makes it 12 
and a half I want you to find two things first  
how often should big blind be bluffing when they 
raise and secondly how often should small blind  
defend versus that rise take a moment to think 
about your answer pause the video if you need
to
we'll start with the first question find big 
blind's bluffing frequency so recall that the  
bluffing frequency is just equal to the pot odds 
laid in other words we need to find the risk  
reward of calling on the river anyway again this 
does not apply to earlier streets so what is the  
risk reward of small blinds call how often do we 
need to be bluffing for small blind to be exactly  
Break Even when they call a bluff catcher their 
risk of calling is the amount they're being asked  
to call so they've already put in two and a half 
we've raised to 12.5 so 12.5 minus 2.5 equal 10  
that's the risk we're saying hey small blind would 
you please put in another 10 chips the reward if  
they call us successfully is that they'll gain the 
pot of five plus their previous bet which is now  
a sunk cost like they they don't get this if they 
fold of 2.5 plus our raise of 12.5 so it's all of  
these things together and that adds up to 20 pot 
odds again can be expressed as simple risk reward  
calculation 10 divided by 10 + 20 10 over 30 1/3 
so big blind should be bluffing a third of the  
time because the Pod odds are 33% and if we want 
to find the break even point of a bluff catcher  
well it's 33% step two we're going to find how 
often small blind should defend so recall that  
their defend defending frequency is just equal 
to the minimum defense frequency and MDF is just  
1 minus Alpha now there are some formulas that 
calculate MDF immediately I recommend you don't  
use those because they just don't work with 
arrays So Pro tip always find Alpha first I  
want you to find think about what we're actually 
asking here we're saying hey big blind might be  
over bluffing how often does small blind need 
to defend to prevent them from profitably doing  
that so we rephrase the question what's the risk 
reward of big blind's Bluff they're risking 12.5  
this is what they stand to lose if they Bluff 
unsuccessfully and the reward is the pot plus  
small blinds bet of 2.5 this is what they stand 
to gain if they Bluff successfully Alpha again is  
just a risk reward calculation so risk over risk 
Plus reward in this case comes out to 62.5% in  
other words big blind has a break even bluff if 
small blind folds at least 62 and a half percent  
of the time so big blind's really hoping that 
small blind folds more often than this bringing  
that back to small blind's defending frequency 
MDF is just one minus that number so small blind  
should defend at least 37.5% of the time in 
order to prevent big blind from profitably  
bluffing therefore we have our answer simple 
as that okay that all sounds good and well but  
here's a question does the solver agree with our 
math let's take a look this is a simple cash Game  
Spot it's checked all the way down to the river a 
98 five King so lots of different hands get there  
right uh there's Straits there's flushes there's 
two pairs all kind of different hands but not a  
lot of action so far so we check and because there 
hasn't been much action small blind puts in a nice  
thin value bet half po mostly representing like 
kingx second parai pants action back on us in the  
big blind and you can see they're raising pretty 
aggressively 16.2% of the time but what are we  
representing when we check rais the river well 
some flushes some Straits some sets and a whole  
lot of two pair right these are hands that like 
maybe they slowed down because the flush completed  
on the turn but hey then we didn't see any action 
so now we decid to check raise the river so we  
can also see that there are low pairs in here 
and the low pairs represent the Bluffs and hey  
wouldn't you know it we're bluffing 32.9% of the 
time that's exactly what we expect with the pod  
ODS another way we can view this is to click 
overview put in the Rays and here we can see  
pod ODS we just zoom in pod ODS 33% right exactly 
what we expect another thing we can do is take a  
look at the ranges Tab and check out this Equity 
distribution now this long flat line here this  
represents small blinds Equity facing arrays and 
the reason it's so flat is because most of their  
hands are indifferent right so all the hands along 
this line have 33% Equity give or take facing our  
Rays they Equity facing our rays and you can see 
that they're going to be indifferent with all of  
these hands here these are their this is the 
bluff catching region all the way through here  
we can also examine this blue line and so let's 
just take a look and see how this is divided we  
can see that 1/3 so these you know from here to 
here this is is Big blind's bluffing frequency  
and then this section over here this represents 
2/3 2/3 of this is big blind V for Value right  
is the value betting percentage and again it's 
just going to be equal to whatever pot odds are  
laid so if we hover our Mouse directly over this 
blue line and you scroll down to the bottom this  
will tell you the frequency if I line that up 
you can see it says 33 at the very bottom here  
which tells us that a third of big blinds range 
or Bluffs and 2/3 of value bets which is exactly  
what we expect in this scenario finally we can 
take a look at small blinds defending frequency  
now if you recall 62.5% of the time they're 
supposed to fold so you can see that's pretty  
much what's happening right they're folding just 
very slightly more than this break even frequency  
and they're defending so calls plus all the 
raises group together about what we expect  
a little more than 32.5% now it's not always 
going to be perfectly accurate because we're  
turning some maid hands into Bluffs here right 
but you'll see that it's going to be pretty darn  
close in a lot of these scenario so we know the 
fold percentage we know the defending percentage  
and therefore this toy game math is going to 
work so we've only really covered the basics  
today and the truth is you can use risk reward 
for like a bunch of different things you can  
use it to calculate implied odds like how much 
extra money do I need to make on the river for  
my draw to be good uh you can use it to calculate 
uh like bubble factors in tournaments you can use  
it to calculate risk premiums and you can also 
use it to calculate edges I'm not going to have  
time to go through all of those examples but 
I'll share a fun one with you that was posed  
to 2 plus two a few weeks ago so a colleague 
of mine was digging through his database and  
he noticed this really interesting spot villain 
bets Pawn on the river and he has a bluff catcher  
now he knows according to his database that in 
this particular spot villain seems to be over  
bluffing 10% of the time by villain I just mean 
the population tends to be bluffing 10% more than  
the Pod outs would dictate we also know that 
they F to AR raise 10% more than MDF H okay so  
our options are we can call or we can shove for 
three times the BET should you call or should you
raise all right so I'm going to show you two 
methods the very first method is what we'll  
call the hard way this is the way most poker 
coaches would approach this problem is to First  
calculate the breake even percentage of you know 
the bluffing frequency and the folding frequency  
then add the extra 10% over Bluff and over fold 
plug that into an EV equation and then see which  
is bigger okay it's straightforward it's just 
tedious I'll walk you through that real quick  
I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this 
here's the hard way on the left hand side we  
have the EV of calling we can calculate the 
reward and this is the only thing I care that  
you understand is the risk reward in this spot 
the reward is they've put in a pot siiz bet if we  
call correctly we gain the pot plus their bet two 
pots the risk is we call and lose one pot you can  
calculate the break even points you can calculate 
their actual bluffing frequency you can then plug  
that into an expected value equation and you can 
calculate the expect Ed value of calling this over  
bluffing bet is 0.3 Pots if you don't like pots 
you can put in big blinds or dollars or chips  
or bananas or whatever other units you prefer 
it's the same process now EV of bluff raising  
again we're not going to go too deep into this 
all I really care about is that you understand  
how to get the risk and reward if you raise three 
times the BET and you're successful well they've  
put in a pot siiz bet so you gain the pot plus 
their bet two pots if you're unsuccessful if your  
bluff race gets called you lose three pots three 
times the BET again you can calculate the break  
even fold percentage the you know add 10% you get 
the actual fold percentage plug all that into an  
expected value equation and you can find that the 
EV of bluff raising is 0.5 pots so obviously Bluff  
raising is better than calling right but this 
was pretty tedious this is like a lot of math  
so there's another equation you can use that's uh 
actually a little bit easier here I'll show you  
the easy way and this one is just EV equals Edge * 
risk Plus reward where Edge is the actual success  
rate minus the break even success rate so in our 
example we know they're over bluffing and over  
folding by 10% that's our Edge right we can plug 
this in EV of calling again we know the risk we  
know the reward we know the formula EV call equals 
our 10% Edge times risk Plus reward 0.3 pots EV  
Bluff raay we know the reward we know the risk the 
expected value of bluff raising is just equal to  
our Edge times the risk plus the reward it's 10% * 
5 or 0.5 pots so we get the same answer either way  
I find this formula is just a lot easier because 
you don't have to calculate like the break even  
percentage and this and that you can just you know 
it's like three numbers it's really quick and easy  
either way we get that the answer is that bluff 
raising is more profitable than calling but this  
leads to another question should you raise bigger 
or smaller smaller than three times the pots  
imagine you could raise larger if you wanted to or 
you could raise smaller if you're shorter stacked  
what would be optimal and again we're assuming 
that they fold 10% more than MDF no matter what  
and that they are bluffing more than 10% more 
than pod ODS would dictate so take a moment to  
consider your answer do you want to go bigger 
or do you want to go smaller to optimize your  
expected value the answer is that bigger is better 
and the reason is that overfolded by 10% is simply  
a bigger mistake than over bluffing by 10% and the 
reason that's the case is because both of these  
can be expressed as 10% times some amount the BET 
plus pot that's a reward the only difference is  
that AR raise is always bigger than a call right 
so the expected value of bluff raising is going  
to be higher always than the expected value of 
calling and therefore even if it's a m click or an  
all-in EV raise is better the ACT actual intuitive 
takeaway is that in order for this to be true our  
opponent needs to be bet folding some value hands 
in addition to those pluss so this doesn't work if  
they never fold a value hand right if they're 
perfectly polarized obviously your assumption  
that they're folding 10% more than MDF is wrong 
and this just doesn't work but the assumption is  
that they'll bet fold some value in addition 
to their Bluffs and that's where your actual  
Edge comes from let's summarize what we've learned 
today once you understand risk reward calculation  
you know the fundamental math that drives poker 
strategy risk is just what you stand to lose if  
you're unsuccessful reward is what you stand to 
gain pot odds is just the risk reward of calling  
or alternatively you can think of this as the 
break even River bluffing frequency Alpha is just  
the risk reward of bluffing which is equivalent 
to 1 minus MDF and a break even calculation  
can be expressed always as risk divided by risk 
Plus reward you could we can also think of this  
as converting odds to a percentage we have some 
ratio of reward and risk and we want to convert  
that over to some implied probability finally we 
have expected value if you know your reward you  
know your risk and you have an idea of the win and 
lose rates well you can plug that in and calculate  
exactly how much money you'll make or lose and if 
you have an idea of your Edge that is to say how  
much more successful you'll be than the break even 
percentage you can use this equation instead which  
is just a little bit easier to work with that's
