### TOPIC: pot odds a key concept for successful poker players
if you've ever played poker you've probably heard 
the term pot odds but what exactly does this mean  
and how can you apply it to your game the truth 
is a lot of players misunderstand this topic or  
misapply it so today we're going to take a deep 
dive into one of poker's most important equations
hot odds in poker tell you how often you need 
to win to break even when calling a bet and this  
calculation is fundamental to Poker Theory because 
it weighs the risk and the reward of calling  
so the fundamental goal is to recover at least 
as much value as you called on average sometimes  
you'll win sometimes you'll lose but on average 
you want to win at least as much money as you call  
so let's put this to the test  
this is a button versus big blind single race 
pod the button bets three chips into a pot  
of five and a half chips what are your pots 
take a moment to consider your answer [Music]  
the answer is B 26 percent let's reframe the 
question button bets three chips into a pot  
of five and a half how many chips do you need 
to win on average to justify calling well at  
least three chips right that's the size of the 
call we want to recover at least three chips  
three chips divided by the size of the new pot 
equals twenty six percent so the general equation  
is simply the amount to call divided by the pot 
after you call and this will tell us the required  
Equity where Equity is just a fancy term for how 
often you'll win okay but why is it called odds  
but we're using it as a percentage well you 
can use either they both serve a good purpose  
to calculate as odds you simply use the equation 
reward to risk here's an example you're facing a  
half pot bet the risk is half a pot and the reward 
is your opponent's bet plus the pot one and a half  
you're getting one and a half to half or three to 
one which is just a fancy way of saying that the  
reward is three times greater than the risk 
now tricky question if you're getting three  
to one in a bet how much Equity do you need 
to call take a second to consider your answer
[Music]
the answer is B 25 percent if you guessed C 
this is a very common mistake it's not one  
divided by three it's one divided by three plus 
one the general equation is risk divided by risk  
Plus reward that's how you convert a risk reward 
calculation into an equity equation so you need to  
win 25 of the new pot in order to justify calling 
generally speaking you can calculate pot odds as  
odds or Equity odds are better for comparing risk 
reward Equity is better for calculating how often  
you need to win so in this chart I've shown the 
BET size on the left hand side the Pod odds and  
the required equity and you don't necessarily need 
to do math you can just get a chart like this and  
kind of memorize some numbers to have a feeling of 
how it changes let's ask ourselves an interesting  
question how do pot odds scale against an 
increasing bet size here I've graphed the Pod odds  
against the bat size expressed as a percentage 
of the pot and you can see that as the bet gets  
larger and larger you need more and more Equity 
but something interesting happens as the bet  
gets bigger and bigger and bigger 2x pot 3x 4X pot 
you can see it tends to flatten out the required  
Equity is kind of stabilizing and what's Happening 
Here is it's approaching an asymptote at 50  
percent you can't bet a size that's going to force 
a hand that's ahead of your betting range to fold  
and that's what having more than 50 Equity would 
mean I also noticed that the slope of the curve is  
much steeper between the zero to pot size bedding 
range and that's why these sizes are typically  
more common in poker Theory because you get more 
bang for your buck so to speak that is to say  
you can raise their required Equity to call while 
donating less chips to the pot don't get me wrong  
over bats are still common in theory but more 
so in very polarized situations all right let's  
try pot odds facing arrays so button bets three 
into a pot of five and a half and this time a big  
blind shoves 18 chips how much Equity does button 
need to call take a moment to consider your answer
foreign [Music]
so again to calculate the required Equity to call 
you simply use the amount to call divided by the  
pot after you call in that case it comes out to 15 
over 41.5 which means you need 36 percent equity  
to call this shove on the button okay so let's 
put this in practice let's say that the button  
holds King Queen of Clubs so they've got the 
nut flush draw and we suspect that big blind  
is shoving with top hair for example what you 
can do as a simple exercise is counter outs and  
multiply your outs by four there are nine Club 
outs we assume all of them are good in that case  
9 times 4 is 36 percent using the rule of two 
and four and therefore our King Queen of Clubs  
has about 36 percent equity which is exactly 
what we need and if the big blind is bluffing  
at any frequency for example with a worse flush 
draw uh then we have more than enough equity so  
yeah you should probably make this call next I 
want to talk about how pot odds affect your bet  
construction on the river so in this graph I've 
shown the BET size as a percentage of the pots  
on the left hand side your pot odds or required 
Equity to call in the second column and on the  
right column we see value to Bluff construction 
and you'll notice that you can use more Bluffs  
with a larger bet and you need to use fewer Bluffs 
with a smaller bet what's the reason for this  
well it's because when you bet larger your 
opponent needs more Equity to call and if  
you're betting a nuts or Bluff a polarized range 
you need to be bluffing at the same frequency as  
the pot odds you're laying so for example for a 
pot sized bet your opponent needs 33 Equity to  
call and therefore you should be bluffing overall 
a third of the time and the reason for that is  
that you want to make your opponent indifferent 
between calling and folding their Bluff catchers  
if you're under bluffing they can just always 
fold and then your value doesn't get paid off  
and if you're over bluffing they can always call 
and extract value from you using too many Bluffs  
and so the size of the BET influences optimal 
River value to Bluff construction I should note  
however that this doesn't hold for earlier streets 
in fact it compounds on turn and compounds even  
more on the Flop you can Bluff more often on turn 
and even more often on the Flop and this is due  
to a concept called Leverage I'll link an article 
down below to explain that concept further alright  
so let's try to apply the concept of pod odds to 
a pre-flop spot here I've got a standard button  
opening range button opens two and a half chips 
into a pot of one and a half it folds to the big  
blind the required Equity is 1.5 that's how much 
big blind needs to call divided by five and a half  
meaning that we should call with hands that have 
27 equity right right not quite so here is big  
blinds Equity facing this button opening range 
and if you look at the numbers every single hand  
in big blinds range has pot odds to call even 72 
off suit with about 30 percent equity or 29.92 has  
correct odds to call but this should be setting 
off alarm Bells because this is a terrible call  
so even if we look at this in GTL wizard we can 
see that calling raising doing anything other than  
folding is just setting money on fire with this 
hand and clearly just calling all of your hands  
is not a good strategy so why is this well back in 
the day people used to open Forex three and a half  
X because they calculated this exact same thing 
they said if I don't open large enough then I'm  
not laying the right odds and Silvers came along 
and they showed no you don't have to lay the right  
odds this straight because if they call too wide 
you can punish them on later straights and this  
gets to some fundamental limitations of pot odds 
in the sense that we typically use it the pot  
odds equation is sound to be clear but Equity this 
concept of how often a hand will win this is not  
sound because raw Equity doesn't correctly predict 
value When Future bets can occur it doesn't  
consider actions on later straights Equity as 
we've seen in that previous graph just thinks how  
often will the hand win when it's checked down it 
doesn't consider all of the future bets that can  
happen times where you get forced off your hand or 
when more money flies in it just assumes that 7-2  
is going to win 30 percent of the time but that's 
not the case it's going to win way less than 30  
percent of the pots so when future bets can occur 
there's a fundamental limitation on pod odds  
however if we replaced raw Equity with something 
we can call true Equity then pod odds becomes  
correct and there's been a number of attempts to 
to calculate the true value of a hand and we can  
call this the EV or expected value of a hand at 
first we built a concept of imply dots that is  
to say value that comes in on later Straits and 
people built extensive models and spreadsheets  
trying to map out implied odds but as technology 
developed and solvers came along we invented this  
term Equity realization which is just a factor 
between the raw equity and the actual value of a  
hand within a GTO solution so let's touch on these 
topics a bit and see how you can apply them to  
your game starting with implied odds implied odds 
are the money you expect to win on future streets  
for example when you out draw your opponent and 
win extra money reverse implied odds also exist so  
this is money you expect to lose on future streets 
for example when you out draw and lose anyway  
let me give you an example let's say we're drawing 
to a club flush on the turn we're facing some turn  
bet we've got a flush draw We call we can make 
extra money on the river when our opponent bats  
are for example we can bet the river when we hit 
uh but we incur no extra loss beyond our turn call  
when we miss and therefore we can say that future 
profits decrease the required Equity to call this  
is because we're making more money when we hit 
and losing less when we miss here we can see the  
expected value of a club flush draw on the river 
and obviously it's going to be much higher when  
you hit and you can get more money in in this case 
and don't have to put more money in when you miss  
reverse implied odds also exist so you could make 
the flush draw uh and then lose to a better flush  
and get stuck this also happens and Silvers are 
very very sensitive to implied and reverse implied  
odds particularly in deep stack scenarios or 
100 big blind cash games for example they're  
very sensitive to implied odds what about Equity 
realization well your true Equity is the actual  
pot share you expect to win given all the 
post-flop variables Equity realization is  
a factor that goes in between your equity and your 
expected value so here's one equation for it but a  
more intuitive equation is just your EV pot share 
so what percentage of the pot will you actually  
win divided by your Equity pot share how often 
would you win if it were checked out and so Equity  
realization is great because it tells you how well 
a hand performs relative to this static check down  
Equity an equity realization Factor greater than 
one indicates a hand is over realizing its Equity  
less than one means it's under realizing its 
equity fundamentally this is really handy for  
learning which hands benefit from building a pot 
and which hands given the option would prefer to  
just check it down if they could uh not always 
they can't always do that of course but it gives  
you an idea of the incentives and the performance 
of different hands in your range let's put Theory  
into practice using a GTO wizard example so cutoff 
opens 2.3 and we Face a three bet from the button  
and recall the Flop comes King 962 tone 
so first of all let's examine the equity  
realization I'm going to select the ranges tab 
so I can compare both players ranges at the  
same time we'll go full screen and I'm going 
to select eqr from both of these drop downs  
now remember an equity realization of greater than 
100 percent means that those hands would win more  
than if they were checked out and you can 
see that most hands in the buttons range  
are over realizing their equity and this is due to 
their overwhelming positional and Equity advantage  
meanwhile on the cutoff side of things most of 
their range is under realizing their equity and  
so the cutoff is going to struggle immensely here 
and that's shown here in the eqr section we can  
see that the button has more Equity more expected 
value and will realize more of that Equity  
but which hands realize Equity more well for 
example if we just take a look at let's say 10 8  
can see that most of these 10 8 are not doing so 
well they're only realizing about 40 to 60 percent  
of their Equity but tenative hearts with the flush 
draw is going to be much better and that's because  
this hand has better implied odds and it can 
win more value so 10 8 is quite a valuable hand  
here if you have a flush draw uh not so much 
without so draws tend to overrealize equity  
similarly nutted hands tend to overrealize equity 
especially if your opponent is in a position where  
they should act aggressively so pocket sixes in 
the cutoffs case it's going to win way more than  
it would if the pot were checked down all right 
so let's go back to the hand here we checked to  
the aggressor and they range bets and you can see 
it uses something like a 20 33 pot sized bet I'll  
choose the 33 now facing this bet how much 
Equity do we need well if you calculate your  
pod odds you'll find you need about 20 Equity 
let's think about this which hands in our range  
have 20 Equity I'm going to use the breakdown 
tab and the reason I'm using this is because  
it has this all combo summary at the bottom which 
displays the equity of your hands and the strategy  
of your hands so we're sorted by the weakest 
hands here to the strongest hands on the right  
and we can see some interesting stuff going on 
so for example up here pocket eights is folding  
and I'm going to click all over here and this 
will display the equity of this hand we can see it  
has 39 Equity that's a lot of equity and we only 
needed 20 so why is this hand folding well we take  
a look over here we can see Jack 10 only has 25 
Equity but it's always continuing and the reason  
for this is imply dots Jack 10 is a draw to the 
nuts whereas pocket eights is especially pocket  
eights without a heart uh is really doing badly 
at best you can hit a set and half of your sets  
complete flush draws not a fun situation to be in 
conversely if we look at something like this let's  
say ace of hearts jack of diamonds well you've 
got an over card to the king backdoor flash draw  
back door straight draw and importantly you can 
hit Top pair without completing those flush draws  
and so these things all Impact how much value your 
hand will generate on later streets so raw Equity  
isn't really an appropriate Factor here rather we 
want to anticipate the actual value of our hand  
all right so let's go on with the example we 
call the turn is the two of spades we check  
our opponent bets let's say 75 pot and we call and 
let's say we get an eight of spades River we check  
the opponent shoves just about full pot actions 
back on us now let's take a look at the ranges tab  
here I want to take a look at this Equity graph 
this displays every combination in both players  
range this blue line shows the cutoff's range 
and this green line shows the buttons range and  
see here we can see the button's value and the 
buttons Bluffs and they're polarized right they  
have strong hands and they have weak hands and 
we have Bluff catchers mostly notice something  
interesting about the bluff catchers it's a long 
flat line where everything has approximately 33  
Equity give or take and the reason for this is 
that the silver is balanced for a pot sized bet  
how much Equity do you need well you need 33 
Equity facing this bet in order to call and  
so these hands that are indifferent like Ace 
9 Ace Queen should all have about 33 equity
and similarly buttons should be 
bluffing about a third of the time
which is pretty much exactly what they're doing 
and so you can see when parades becomes much  
stronger if you're using Equity as opposed to 
the True Value had on the river is simply because  
ranges are more polarized and when you look at 
previous Straits and earlier Straits we're more  
concerned with things like how can we outro our 
opponent's value range which hands are going to  
perform better and what's the true value of 
this hand rather than what is the check down  
Equity of this hat for further info check out 
the Articles I've linked below if you want to  
learn how to use pod odds to optimize stack-off 
ranges how to calculate the EV of calling or  
how to derive the potass formula using expected 
value or even determine optimal River bluffing  
frequencies all of that can be done with pod 
odds it's a really useful equation despite its  
limitations so check out that article if 
you'd like to learn more let's summarize  
pot odds compare the risk of 
calling to the reward of winning  
fundamentally if the bet is five dollars you need 
to win at least five dollars back on average and  
in order to calculate how often you'll need 
to win that new pot for example what you do  
is you say how much do I need to call and divide 
that by the pot after you call the thing is that  
raw Equity or required Equity ignores action on 
future streets and so things like implied odds  
Equity realization and these post-flop variables 
can all affect the true Equity of a hand if you
