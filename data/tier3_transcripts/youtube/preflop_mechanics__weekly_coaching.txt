### TOPIC: preflop mechanics
perfect let's get started
so
is pre-flop important
um i mean all strategies stem from
pre-flop play and if you don't get it
correct those errors can snowball on
later streets i'm going to introduce
some basic pre-flop mechanics that'll
help you adapt and sharpen your strategy
to maximize your win rate i'll also go
into some of the more theoretical
aspects that you're not going to find in
a lot of other channels but they may
help you think about the spots
in a more concise way
so here's the outline going to go
through some basic pre-flop theory
thresholds polarity pricing time ev
stack depth uh the efficient jam
principle the bunching effect and at the
end we're going to look at how to adjust
exploitatively to different opponents
now let me just get started with some
the most basic thing i could think of
which is just the blinds everything
starts at the blinds right
let's imagine there were no blinds no
money posted into the pot how would your
range change in that case uh let me see
i think i have a poll somewhere
all right i've just launched a poll what
do you guys think let's say there's no
rake
no anti no blinds
[Music]
sorry i didn't catch that can you say
again
open tighter
yeah
certainly so everyone agrees you should
be opening tighter the question is how
much tighter and if you think about it
it's essentially betting into a a pot
with no money is an infinite bet
relative to the pot right it's kind of
mathematically equivalent to betting a
billion dollars into a one cent pot and
if you think about it in that sense the
only hand that should really play is ace
if you plug this into a solver
of course it will only open asus but
it's programmed to never fold the sound
and you could even argue that opening no
hands is correct it'll be the same eevee
is opening only ace point is that you
need money in the pot to incentivize any
betting so what happens is out of
position should only defend hands that
are better than we open with and we
should only open hands that are better
than what they call with
and these two form a feedback loop that
leads you to opening aces or nothing all
right let's go on with this
what we can take away from that little
thought experiment is that
you need money in the pot to incentivize
opening and the more money in the pots
to start with
uh the more incentive you have to play
that's why anti-rangers tend to be wider
for example or mtt ranges without rake
and antis tend to be wider that's an
important mechanic to keep in mind for
later spots
let's talk about thresholds now
thresholds are
something you should always pay
attention to
these hands can be used as markers to
identify the break-even parts of your
range
now that's important because
small changes to your opponent's
strategy can shift the zero ev hands
negative or positive so these hands are
typically the first to adapt facing a
different strategy also knowing where
these zero ev hands are kind of outlines
and sculpts your range and makes it
easier to remember right you don't have
to remember every hand individually
rather you could trace the threshold
hands
now when it comes to the method of just
reviewing your preflop strategy it's
often best to try and reduce it to
some color-coded charts as a
memorization strategy i'm sure most 500
nl players have their ranges memorized
for the most part but if you're starting
out one of the simpler exercises you can
do is just make color-coded rfi charts
something like this
for example right these hands are open
in the low jack and like jack four suit
is only open on the button the advantage
to this is that you only have to use one
chart rather than six it makes it much
easier to remember how to adapt your
range by position
and of course you can do the same
kind of exercise with three bets as well
for example small blind facing different
positions
uh let's move on to polarized versus
linear ranges now i'm sure you guys know
what polarized and linear means but just
for the video polarized would be very
strong in weekends linear will refer as
the top down value and some medium hands
now any situation that involves two
actions such as razer fold for example a
button open or a small blind facing in
position open if you don't call those
are linear by definition right you can't
you don't have much wiggle room with any
calls so you're just going to fold the
worst hands and continue with the best
tense these have to be linear now spots
outside of that tend to have flexibility
to become more polarized such as a big
blind facing and in position open in
general in position tends to polarize
harder than out of position it's true
pre-flop and post
now
as far as combating different strategies
go polarized three bets tend to be used
to combat raises that is to say you have
value that's happy to face four bets and
bluffs that are easy folds facing arrays
linear three bets tend to combat calls
this range includes value medium hands
stuff that does well against calls you
want hands with good implied odds as
well as of course value a lot of people
have different ideas of what polarized
versus linear versus merged looks like
pre-flop and to be fair it's not quite
clear what is a value bet what is a
bluff so the easiest way to visualize
this
is just to look at the eevee now i'm
going to do a couple comparisons here
i'm going to take a look at big blind
versus button and we're looking at their
three bet range specifically
so one of the first things
you'll note here is that you have these
stronger hands and of course you have
most of these hands that will fold to a
race we can consider these the bluffs
and these the value
and
in practice it's not perfectly polarized
but it becomes more polarized as we
increase the bet size so for example we
can see that the 13 big blind three bet
is using slightly weaker bluffs
than the 11 big blind three bet where
it's starting to merge its bluffs a bit
more
and at 500 nl we can see a similar
effect
using more polarized strategies with
bigger bet sizes
and more linear strategies with smaller
bet sizes
we can
put this into a gif and just see how
that polarization changes as we change
the rake
and the rays size
and we can see it become
more linear and more polar
so
does anyone have any questions from this
point feel free to type in the chat or
just chat up if you
have any questions
all right perfect
let's go on then
think about the incentives of different
parts of your range a bluff like queen
two suited or jack four these hands are
mostly concerned with fold equity merged
hands like queen jack have plenty of
easy eevee as a flat rather than a three
bet
and if you raise too large these hands
have poor equity retention that is to
say your equity against the hands that
call you if you raise
at a certain point
these very mergy hands just become
better as calls than as raises
now polarized strategies of course we've
said use this when they tend to four bet
fold a lot
linear ranges when they tend to call a
lot
alex asks in practice is bigger three
bet better for 500 solely because of
rake or because of player pool i
wouldn't say one is particularly better
per se i would say that 500 tends to be
more linear than 50.
and that's
largely because
at the higher rate structure you're
going to get less calls when or less
folds when you three bets and they'll
call more and so for the same reason you
want to use a linear range if they're
calling a lot you want to use a linear
range if the rake dictates that they'll
call more
in contrast if the break dictates that
they should fold more here we have
higher rake then the strategy tends to
become more polarized
hope that makes sense
so i'm going to move on to blockers
now blockers are a pretty important
concept that aren't well studied preflop
let's start with a simple example this
is big blind facing a button open
i think it's 500 nl cash game
so by default they're going to fold 56
call about 30 percent raise 13.
if you hold ace ace you expect them to
fall three percent more
and call and raise less often and
conversely if you hold two two you
expect them to
fold a lot less
call more and raise more
and so every hand in your range has
individual blocker effects against the
opponent's ranges
and this can actually have a big impact
on your strategy
for example back in the day most
most bluff three bets were all these low
cards you know seven six suited seven
five suited six three suited these hands
were preferred for three bets for some
time several years ago when solvers came
along they showed that
using ace king queen jack kind of hands
tend to have better blockers and are
preferred as a three bet bluff a lot of
the time it's the same reason why we see
uh for example these suited hands move
but like queen ten queen jack king jack
king ten these hands all have excellent
blockers so these hands can fit into a
more polarized strategy as well
let's try an experiment it folds to us
on the button we can open 2.5 or fold
let's assume the blinds can only raise
fold and cannot call our bet they
literally can't call big blind's got a
raising range and a folding range
no calling range
so how should we adjust our opening
range on the button this one's kind of
weird
what ends up happening is we get this
ridiculous arrow shape so what it's
doing is it knows it's not going to get
called instead it's just choosing hands
that block raises
aces kings queens jacks etc
right
so for example a hand like jack 5 will
never ever see a flop
either the blinds will fold or the
blinds will raise and jack 5 will fold
hands with bad blockers like 2 2 or 5 4
will raise and then call
a three bet
so they can at least realize some post
flop equity so here this is in a way
just visualizing the blocker effect and
we can see this effect becomes a little
more strong in early position
as
for example hands with an ace or king
will tend to be opened
significantly wider
so
i want to talk about pricing next and i
think this is something that a lot of
people get wrong
pricing refers to
how much a strategy should adjust
according to bet size
specifically relating to calls
on the left here
we have big blind versus under the gun
min opening
and here we have big blind versus under
the gun opening 2.5 and we can see that
there is a pretty substantial difference
in how wide we call
a lot of people they'll use one big
blind calling range versus
you know in the big line versus all
under the gun opens whether they open
three or two they'll just defend the
same range but the truth is that when
they open a different amount your pot
odds change and that's going to affect
which hands you should be calling with
even if their range stays the same
one way to visualize this is to create
something i call a pricing elasticity
chart
now there's many different ways you can
code this with different colors and
symbols and whatnot but this is what i
settled on uh one is a mix continue
versus a min open
three is a continue versus a three big
blind open and we have kind of a
gradient in between a good exercise you
can try is opening up gta wizard and
just comparing your defense
against two big blinds and against 2.5
similarly with three bets you can
compare how your strategy should change
facing different bet sizes or different
race sizes
and you'll be surprised to see
just how drastically
pricing can affect your calling wrench
here's the same one done for button
as we can see
a lot of hands will call
a three big blind open
that
you know regardless and we call very
very wide facing them in open
so
of course these hands are quite
sensitive to pricing and it's something
to pay attention to now in mtt's your
pricing is significantly better because
there's a one big blind ante more
and what this does is has the effect of
lowering the pot outs required to call
so for example facing a two big blind
open in a cash game you're calling one
to four point five need twenty two
percent paw chair not even counting the
rake
and an mtt button opens two point three
with anti you actually only need 21 paw
chair so you can call even wider and
there's no rake
so always consider how you might adapt
your strategy facing different bet sizes
and this goes back to just paying
attention to thresholds right like we
saw at the beginning know which hands
are zero ev facing a bet facing arrays
try and pay attention to hands which are
right on the line i guess before i move
on does anyone have any questions about
pricing feel free to type in the chat or
just speak out loud
i see jeff's mic moving but i can't hear
it for some reason anyway i'm going to
move on here
i want to talk about time ev next this
is kind of specific to zoom fast fold
games
these zoom games create a very
interesting incentive you can attempt to
trade big blind per 100 for big blind
per hour
right let's say you have a win rate of
three big blinds
right so king four if you open this 100
times you'll win three big blinds should
you spend time
opening these zero ev hands when you
could simply fold and move on to another
hand that's actually plus cv
now note that in a regular game a
non-fast fall game it doesn't matter
whether or not you open it you still
have to wait for the hand to be done but
in a fast fold game you can get shifted
to the next one
many hands in your opening range are
going to be zero ev or very close to it
and these hands typically add nothing to
your win rate but do cost valuable time
so an adjustment you can make is to
simply fold marginal hands specifically
in anonymous fast fold games
this idea is of course designed to
optimize your big blind per hour rather
than big blind per hundred now one
argument against doing this would be
that bluffs ensure that your value gets
paid off right your opponents can
exploit this by simply under defending
and then you'll have less ev with the
value portion of your range fide says i
noticed the silver titans more and more
on big blind when more players flat the
rfi in front of it is that because our
equity with marginal hands drops at a
higher rate than the improvement on our
odds yes precisely that's
exactly right so
especially when they're flatting tight
ranges
you'll want to continue
less and less because your pot share
just doesn't compete with
the the improved pot odds
now of course if they're defending too
wide then you might see the opposite
effect you know if there's a whole bunch
of people in there very wide then all of
a sudden you get fantastic pot odds
and you'll actually realize a decent
share of the pot
so back to time ev here if you think
your opponents aren't going to exploit
you by under defending you may want to
just consider folding a lot of these
marginal hands to try and maximize your
pipelines per hour anonymous zoom games
especially you can make this adjustment
so let's talk about why you want to open
big or small now people open different
sizes and to be honest there's not a
huge ev difference between opening two
and a half versus opening two from under
the gun right however there is a
significant strategic difference they
play
very differently typically solvers
prefer
a smaller opening size from early
position
and a slightly larger size from light
position in general if you expect that
the table will mostly three better fold
versus your open
then you want to use a smaller size to
give them a worse price on a raise
conversely if the table is over calling
and under raising then generally you
want to size up to make them overpay for
their equity when you're opening from
early position in silverland you
actually expect to get three bet more
often than you expect to get called
depending on sizing of course from the
late position it's typically the exact
opposite you expect to get called more
than three bet the solvers sizing down
in early position is really to
try and combat raises combat three bets
lose less when it has to open fold
while still being able to bet or raise
any amount with its value portion
let's compare the lojack's expected
value when opening hands on the left we
have a two big blind strategy
on the right we have a two and a half
big blind strategy now if you're just
scanning through these one at a time
it's kind of difficult
the overall frequency is almost
identical
and the evs seem very close in a lot of
spots an easier way to look at the data
is simply compare the ev difference
between different parts of our range so
the value portion of the range
specifically queens plus
and ace queen
these hands actually benefit from a
larger size
whereas most of the rest of the range
will lose some value or
it was already zero ev to start with so
sizing up in general costs you more
with most of your range
but makes you more at the very top of
your range and so again if people are
over calling perhaps you should be
sizing up especially at the top of your
range
anyway does anyone have any questions
about this so far
one thing that surprised me was just how
much jax loses in this configuration
very interesting
so let's go on to stack depth now as
stacks get deeper hands that can make
draws tend to become more valuable
stacks have the effect of
magnifying implied odds and conversely
as stacks get shallower hands that can
make a strong top pair kind of hand
become more valuable and the implied
odds of draws tends to drop off
so here we can see how the three bet
strategy changes
across
different stack depths and we can see
the hand slowly shifting from
kind of
this
very polar
offsuit heavy thing to more
suited hands more draw heavy hands
now i wanted to test this one day uh
this was a while back
so i designed a little experiment it's
big blind facing a 2.5 big blind open
and this time it's heads up as opposed
to six max
no rake no anti just a
straightforward heads up cash game
i wanted to see how the big blinds raise
size would change
as we change the effective stack would
they prefer to three bet larger three
bets smaller
how does that change
so i designed this experiment and
again we can see
it goes from many of these offsuit hands
to more of these suited connected
taipans as the stacks increase
and more surprisingly
i found that three bet size tends to
actually decrease
at a certain point big blind actually
wants to start using a smaller size now
it creates an interesting effect because
typically you want
you know
a larger size around 100 150 big blinds
deep but get a little too small or a
little too big and it starts sizing down
again
if we take a look at the expected value
we can see that
buttons ev the in position player
their ev increases
as we move up stack depth and of course
this tells us that the positional
advantage gets magnified as stacks get
deeper
and in general
late position will rfi wider as stacks
get deeper as more hands are profitable
to play in position
so i guess before i move on to this
what questions do you guys have
looks like this levels off at some point
yeah
yeah it does it does tend to level off i
would imagine that if we kept doing this
we get kind of a
a graph that approaches some asymptotes
at the top
that is to say the positional advantage
doesn't grow
infinitely it'll start to get smaller
and smaller relative to
going deeper and deeper why do we three
bet smaller at 300 plus big blinds
that's a great question
why is it that you want a three bet
smaller when stacks are getting deeper
why does the silver seem to prefer this
and the reasoning that i could come up
with is called the efficient jam
principle
so
shoving is a pretty serious weapon in
holdem
and
hands that shove will always realize
their equity
so the silver often fights to give its
opponent a bad price on a shove
now we see this in a variety of spots we
see for example min opens or even limps
in short stack mtt play we see min
raiser jams in for example 75 big blind
deep cash games
we see for example smaller four bet
sizes 100 big lines deep but then larger
four bet sizes 200 big blinds deep
now in what we've studied the large
three bet forces a larger four bet which
gives the three better a better price on
a shove 100 big blind steep
that's a little confusing but to put it
another way
100 big blind steep
if you three bet
and they four bet
you can guarantee yourself a reasonable
price on a five bet shove
that is not true 300 big blind steep
uh whereas if we three bet and they
raise there's still a lot of money left
to go we can't we don't have that
profitable shove so trying to force a
large four bet is not
so efficient anymore are we incentivized
to four bet bigger the deeper we get or
the same three bet principles apply yeah
so at 100 big blinds what ends up
happening is the four bed is actually
very compressed right four bets are very
small 100 big blind steep and that's
because you're trying to give
big blind or you're trying to give the
opponent a poor price on a raise
as you get deeper the four bets actually
become
bigger and bigger until they even out at
some point
and that's because they're no longer
compressed by this 100 big blind stack
depth they can they have more room to
expand and play a more natural say pot
sized race as opposed to something like
a half pot sized race
i'm just going to go to gto wizard and
explore a few examples here
so for example
this is 500 nl simple
button open
big blind racist 10
and of course on the button
it either uses an all in it just shoves
or it raises this very small sizing to
try and give them a bad price in the
race right like if you give the solver
like a larger size here it's just going
to be an efficient it won't really use
it it'll either use a very small size or
a shove
just to try and be more efficient
and we can go take a look at 200 nl for
example
um
big blind rays
and we see the four bet size is 38 big
blinds as opposed to the normal
you know 20 or 25 pip lines and that's
simply because you have more
room to expand your raise size without
uh making
yourself uh without giving them a great
price on a shove
does anyone have any questions about
that
all right so yeah interesting experiment
with stack depth um
let's move on to one of my favorite
topics and this is the bunching effect
people tend to fold low cards more often
than high cards right and this means
that after many folds we can expect that
the deck and the future ranges the
ranges ahead if those folds will contain
on average more high cards than low
cards
so for example if under the gun folds
they're more likely to have folded a 2
than an ace
and that shifts the distribution and
this
shifting card removal effect is known as
the bunching effect
um so we can see how this kind of plays
out
over here we have the
the deck density from ace king queen
jack 10 all the way through two as
this goes through so at the start of the
hand everything's even under the gun
folds high jack folds cut off folds
button folds and then small blind raises
and it evens out and we can see here
that there's going to be more higher
cards in the deck by the time it gets
the small blind
due to the bunching effect
if we compare how this might affect our
strategy
we can see on the left this is one i've
sold for a nine max game and this is
what i've solved for three max game this
is opening on the button and we can see
that for example in nine max many of
these these hands
with lower cards are simply less
preferred right three max for opening
twos five three seven four these hands
aren't really in the nine max range
so
that's why
uh for example
six max you're going to get different
results depending on where you get your
preflop ranges because they may or may
not have included the bunching effect
which can skew the strategy
let's say it folds the small blind in a
not in a 9 max game what that means is
not only will the deck will be different
but
small blinds range itself will also be
different they're not going to be dealt
all hands with an equal probability
so for example 2 2
would expect
you'd expect to be dealt this much less
often than ace ace and so if you open
any two cards from the small blind after
a bunch of folds your range actually
looks something like this even though
strategically it's just any two cards
it's actually going to be more top-heavy
due to these bunching effects and if
anyone has wants to do any more research
i highly suggest visiting this link here
visualizing the bunching effect
this is a blog i helped write with hrc
that goes over
some of these in more detail
anyone have any questions about the
bunching effect
i guess one question you should have is
does gtl wizard account for the bunching
effect
and the answer is yes
they
in purposely include folded ranges from
earlier positions so that these card
removal effects are accounted for not
everyone does that by the way
all right let's move on to some general
pre-flop adjustments so in general
to combat raising
you use a more polarized strategy right
you lose less rays folding bluffs than
medium hands
um to combat raising you can also open
or better raise smaller right you lose
less because you've bet a smaller amount
and of course to combat raising you use
bluffs with
better blockers forever and better
playability
conversely we can say how does one
combat too much calling well use a more
linear strategy choose hands with good
post flop playability you can open and
bet larger to overcharge your value
you can use bluffs that have better
implied odds post flop rather than
focusing on hands that blocks raises
fida asks
is this why a's two off
open folds on late position yeah i mean
ace two off but
as it relates to the bunching effect
it's kind of got both right you've got
the ace the highest card and the lowest
card so it kind of feels both ends of
the bunching effect at the same time
so
how to adjust
what i'm going to do now is
say
we're going to run some free flop
experiments folds the button
how should button adjust in these
different situations
and i'm going to launch a poll here this
one's easy enough
there's four questions on it
how would you guys react in these
different scenarios
[Music]
[Music]
all right we got
six responses so far yeah i mean the
general adjustment is uh
fairly easy and i think most of you guys
got these more or less correct
so
first one
big blind is too tight
button opens 2.5 the big blind's calling
range
or their strategy looks like this so big
blind is calling
10 fewer hands than they otherwise
should as compared to the gto solution
and it's interesting because everyone
that voted
they said
yeah if they're overfolding just open
wider what are you doing of course right
because you'll have more fold equity
and indeed the solver does opening uh
60.7 so opening a lot more hands
uh and we can see it is focusing on
hands that typically have good blockers
against the rays because they're still
raising quite a bit here
as a size adjustment you may want to min
open and
for that reason you'll risk less and be
able to open even wider
as an exploit if they're overfolding
that is and so that's just a way to
minimize your risk in order to maximize
your reward so
the opposite
scenario
most people said open tighter which is
correct someone said open wider
and this is just the exact same thing in
reverse
if your hands have less ev stealing the
blinds then they're not going to
necessarily be break even or zero ev
they might be negative ev right you can
always try and justify opening wider
with some kind of
you know post flop skill edge
but
if that skill edge is neutral you should
open tighter
if they're defending too wide
and here we can see that
button is only opening like 29 instead
of 43 much tighter overall versus this
big blind strategy
as a size adjustment
you can actually
use a larger size to extract even more
value with this tight range right
the expected value of marginal opens
becomes negative if you aren't stealing
the blinds often enough okay we've seen
that
and the ev of premium hands increases
slightly
so
scenario three the blinds raised too
small now i'm sure you guys have all
seen this in your game oh hold on we've
got a question here does the positional
advantage a factor when
big blind opens wider when they defend
wider
yeah it's certainly a factor i mean in
general if they're defending too wide
then you want to open tighter if they're
defending too tight you want to open
wider positional advantage certainly
plays a role there but what i would do
is just try and compare their overall
defending range to what gto is gauge if
they're over or under defending
relative to that
so in this case we're going to say the
blinds don't raise large enough
i'm sure we've all seen this right we
opened 2.5 they raised like eight big
lines right how should the button react
to this size without knowing their range
and of course
most people said call wider someone said
call tighter
no one said call the same amount
and yeah you just call
uh wider
and that's simply because
you're getting such great implied odds
to see three cards like three cards is a
lot of value
generally what will happen is you'll
over call pre-flop and then over fold on
the flop
your positional advantage certainly ties
into that we're in position here which
lets us over realize our equity
so that's why it's calling so wide
and typically what some people will do
is they'll blast it with a massive four
bet but you really don't need a big four
bet
big blinds deep for example you can
raise to 18 this is a
reasonably large size in percentage pod
while still giving big blind a bad price
on a raise i should also point out that
the spr is considerably higher when they
race this small so the button will have
better implied odds with their draws it
says one spot that i face all the time
in my games is that recreational's 3-bet
really small but also really tight i'm
not sure how to adapt and continue
yeah that's a great question fide so
we're going to take a look at that very
shortly
so scenario 4 will say big blind is a
maniac so in this case big blind is
raising
20
versus your range right just a ton of
raising now of course if they're raising
a lot
you guys all voted we should open
tighter and of course because you have
to bet fold a lot of stuff right you
don't get to realize any of that equity
so
that's exactly what we see
silver defending fewer hands and also
shifting away from like these suited
connectors towards hands that block
raises right so again this is why
blockers are important to think about
here's a bonus scenario that i think
fide will appreciate so it's 500 nl 100
big blind steep we open 2.5 big blind
raises to 6.5
which is way too small and also with
this jax plus ace king ace queen suited
super nitty ranch right
how do you punish this how do you adapt
this
well we know we should continue wide but
at the same time
their range is so value heavy right
despite that the solver is still calling
very wide and more so with hands that
are not going to be dominated
by like
queens kings ace king aces stuff like
that right like these lower hands will
have much better implied odds against
that range and it's quite surprising to
see hands like eight five suited and
nine six suited in there what ends up
happening is that you overcall
these hands with great implied odds
against over pairs
and
then you massively over fold on the flop
this play maximizes your equity
realization getting a great price to
cooler old man coffee over here so
hopefully that
helps you out happy
day so
in conclusion we've only really
scratched the surface of many different
pre-flop topics today i realize
you can go a lot deeper in any of these
subjects
but just in general
pay attention and be flexible with your
threshold hands
right know which hands are zero ev
facing arrays or just opening and be
ready to be flexible with those
develop a sense of pricing that is to
say you don't want to play the exact
same calling range versus every single
size you want to be able to adapt your
range facing different prices and you
don't have to be exact with this even
knowing the threshold hands will let you
make good adjustments facing different
prices
if you're starting out use color codes
to simplify your memorization reducing
stuff from six charts to one really
helps you
memorize a lot faster
if you play zoom games consider your
time ev
your big blinds per hour in contrast to
your big blinds per 100 sometimes
in a fast fold game it's worth it just
to skip on to the next hand
if the hand is very close to
that threshold
consider your fold equity and your
blockers all right if you're not getting
enough steals if you've got very obvious
stations on the table or if you've got a
lot of maniacs you know
pay attention to are you blocking raises
will you get your bet through often
enough to open these marginal hands if
not maybe you want to tighten up a bit
right
uh and lastly
don't overestimate your post-flop edge
literally every player at the table
thinks they have a post-flop edge
realistically you should just
try to assume that most of your
opponents are going to be
roughly the same edge as you are and you
want to play the optimal strategy
against an equal opponent
now of course you can factor in pulse
flop edge which would just mean you play
wider everywhere but you
should be careful not not to
overestimate that too much and that's it
that's my lecture i hope you guys
enjoyed it thanks for coming everyone i
really appreciate it good luck with your
grind
