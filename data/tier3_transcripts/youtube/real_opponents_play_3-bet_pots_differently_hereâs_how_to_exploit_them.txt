### TOPIC: explointing 3-bet pots
[Music] hey guys this is URI pelig with my 
first video for GTO wizard in this video I'm  
going to examine a very practical question 
there's often a gap between ranges in the  
solver and ranges in reality when you three bet 
a solver you're going to get a mixed reaction but  
in reality a lot of players love their suited 
connectors and pocket pairs so what changes in  
strategy and how can you make GTO wizard apply 
to real life situations in general let's Dive In
[Music]
we'll start with utg raising and button three 
betting this is NL 500 rake and you can see the  
buttons three bet range is already mixed but 
we're actually going to look at the calling  
range and when you make everyone fold this is 
the calling range that you would get at NL 500  
Drake for under the gun and note that there are a 
few mix is here that uh might not make sense from  
a practical standpoint so one is seven sixes and 
fives folding and I think a lot of players would  
always call these the second is fors 3es induces 
not even always raising that's why you see them  
always calling but not represented very much and 
similarly when we look at suited connectors 56  
and 67 and 78 didn't often rais and 89 and 109 
are folding and queen Jack is folding Queen Jack  
suited Queen 10 Suited and I think there is a 
rather wide SWAT of players who would first of  
all always raise these hands and second of all 
never fold these hands to a r Rae and that's  
going to create a different range situation and 
by examining it we're going to kind of understand  
a little bit of the reasoning for the faults not 
all of it certainly but also kind of what would  
be a a practical adjustment and and I hope that 
by watching me do this you guys will be able to  
do similar things yourselves in the future so 
we have the three bat and we have utg calling  
and we're going to click solve post flop with 
AI and this is where we get to edit the range  
and we can go to utg out of position range 
and say well you know all these hands in here  
we're going to go Deuces threes fours fives sixes 
sevens eights nines tens all of these are going  
to be full frequency and the same for suited 
connectors and this is a big big difference  
uh same for Queen Jack same for Jack 10 and let's 
put Queen 10 suited and and kingt suited is 50%  
hands and I think this is a much more realistic 
representation of what a decent amount of players  
that you play against are going to do I'll even 
add in some more ace4 and ace5 okay um so of  
course once you know this you can even edit 
your three batting range and a nice thought  
experiment would be to say oh this is the three 
bet range this has mixed hands are there hands  
that perform better or worse when my opponent is 
flatting all the pocket pairs on all the suited  
connectors and the answer is well you know Jacks 
and tens are probably going to do really well and  
NES is probably going to do really well and maybe 
a hand like king queen suited or Ace Jack suited  
these hands that do really well against Paris 
and and suited connectors whereas a hand like  
four five suited when your opponent's calling his 
sixes and in sevens the 67 probably does worse so  
you might want to kind of in a simple simplistic 
way say oh well my opponent's likely a calling  
station so I'm going to remove the weaker parts 
of my range and increase the stronger parts of  
my range and and that's a fairly straightforward 
briefl adjustment now we're going to look at a  
few boards and just examine the differences so 
that we have it in our head that I think one  
or two boards should probably do so we're going 
to start with A7 dece rainbow I'm going to bring  
up this range and the normal range side by side 
so this would be the normal range and the normal  
range has 100% cbat And The EV for in position 
is 12.16 the equity is 58 and after the CET we  
get this reaction of 15% check Ray 45% fold which 
is a big over fold right because we we picked a  
board that's very good for the inos player because 
a lot of the hands at flat the three bet are kind  
of speculative hands like the suited connectors 
and the pairs and they don't really improve very  
much this is a good board for the three better 
so out of position has to overfolded make up for  
that there is no point carrying your weaker 
range another Street to a bigger pot so you  
overfolded now how's this going to change when 
we add to the out of position player more 87 7  
six more sevens more Deuces on the one hand but 
also more threes fours five sixes and keep in  
mind these numbers the EV for in position is 
16 well we want to go before the bet the EV  
is 12.16 and the equity is 58% so now same sim 
but in this case we have this full frequency of  
uh suited connectors and pocket Pairs and despite 
hitting more sets the eveve position grew to 12.2  
and the equity grew a lot to 61.5 so what's going 
on here and this is a this is a bit strange but  
it cuts to a really important core aspect of Poker 
is that well sure we added seven IND Deuces but we  
also added sixes fives fours and threes so overall 
the range got weaker and in position gains Equity  
but Equity is not created equal and the equity of 
sevens IND Deuces is so am amazing that despite  
this uh big Equity shift in position gains EV but 
not millions and millions of EV points because  
what's going to happen is that when we check and 
he bets uh yes we're going to fold more remember  
this was folding 45% before but we're also going 
to raise more because we have more of the Polar  
each and so this is now raising 21.5% versus 15 
which is almost a 50% % frequency increase in  
check raising in this specific example and then 
I'm going to show you guys another one we can see  
that adding these pairs and suited connectors on 
the one hand you know we hit flaw we hit this flaw  
plus and we have to fold more on the other hand 
we hit sets more and so we get to Bluff raise  
more and we get to be more aggressive and both 
of those things are important to keep in mind so  
these kind of players who are flatting all these 
hints they're going to over fold to the cat more  
or at least they should maybe they'll choose to 
call you with sixes but at the same time they're  
going to hit more and so you're going to face 
more counter aggression you guys might say okay  
well that's well and good on A7 dece you pick the 
worst board for this range so let's pick a board  
that's much nicer so here we have Queen 67 Tutone 
and here sixes and sevens and 67 suited and 89  
suited and four five suited and all those extra 
hands that we added are actually hitting a lot  
more so what happens now well in the normal this 
is the normal ranges where we see these hands are  
more mixed equity for in position is 52 and the 
eveve is 9.95 and again remember these numbers  
51.9 and 9.95 we're going to compare these and the 
strategy when you check is that in position bets  
very often but not always with a fairly big size 
uh the reaction of out of position is actually  
to check raise this a lot the big size puts you 
into this kind of situation and where you're not  
very incentivized you don't have many hands that 
can actually call and so a lot of your reaction  
kind of becomes raise or fold and and this is 
these prot these raises are kind of protection  
raises with nines it's not exactly a bluffer value 
it's this tiny raise where uh you're just raising  
to to deny some Equity from overcards and then 
you're going to have to play the hand later um  
this is a dynamic here with 80% see that remember 
9.95 and 51.99 now we're going to go and look at  
what happens with the more dense range that's 
going to hit here more and trying to pause the  
video and guess is who's going to have more 
Equity who's going to have more eeve [Music]  
okay so we're within U range and surprisingly 
enough even though uh we picked a board that  
kind of smashes this range EV for in position 
increased uh from 9.95 to 10.24 so almost a  
third of a big blind and his Equity increased so 
what's going on and here I'll bring you guys back  
to the same concept as before and it applies here 
we're saying you know sure sixes and sevens and  
six s suited those are great but what about fives 
and fours and threes and Deuces and ace4 and you  
know Jack 10 and 109 and 78 which is a nice end 
but not very strong so kind of you know we added  
this top range but we also added a very weak 
range and this is kind of what happens when you  
throw in suited connectors and pocket pairs into 
a range and maybe this can lead to a bit of an  
understanding of why there's a limit to how 
many of them you want because these hands  
have a polarized reaction to a flop they either 
hit something very strong or they hit something  
very marginal and they don't often hit in between 
hands so uh how does in position react here and  
the answer is here he actually bets more often 
with a smaller size because uh we the out of  
position player has more strong hands so we less 
incentivized to build a pot but he also has more  
weak hands so we're actually less incentivized to 
kind of prod at the pot and this this is going to  
be I I think kind of a general thing where when 
you change the structure of your range to be you  
know I hit more good hands but also I miss more 
these small bats are going to be more appropriate  
and when you remove these pocket Pairs and make 
the range more you know a range that hits top  
Pairs and middle Pairs and has High cards you're 
probably going to get more uh big bets and and  
more focus on a polarized region and of course 
once the small betat hits there is not as much  
raising of the the crazy kind as we saw before 
which also isn't something that that really  
happens in practice almost no one plays like that 
but yeah we have sixes and sevens and six sevens  
so there is a lot of raising and we have these 
hands Deuces threes fours F so there's also a  
lot of uh folding and problem a slight overfall to 
to this quarter pot B even even though we hit the  
board quite nicely okay let's finish off with the 
most extreme board we can think of for this kind  
of range and I'm actually going to change this and 
we're going to go 5 six 7 twoone and you know as  
good of a board as you can think of for the suited 
connector pocket pair range and here what we see  
is that with the normal ranges this board gets 
ston by 25% of the time and EV for position of  
course is it a disadvantage now I mean this is as 
bad as it gets you could make this monotone maybe  
I'm not even sure that's the worst cuz all your 
Ace Kings would now have a flush draw so eeve 7.9  
equity 46.5 and you know with a disadvantage in 
equity we see out of position actually taking the  
batting lead so yes when we try hard enough we can 
make a board that's better for this range than the  
other range uh e for in position drops a whole lot 
6.31 it's one and A2 big blinds drop Equity drops  
by 2% out of position can now lead everything 
and this is maybe kind of another difference  
that you might think of is that uh for this range 
765 and 654 and 543 it doesn't matter how low the  
board gets you still Smash It whereas the previous 
range the game theory range because it has the low  
Pairs and the low suited connectors less often 
it doesn't smash every board just as equally so  
654 and 876 are not going to be hit to the same 
extent by that range whereas this range is more  
symmetrically s smashing all of these types of 
boards so also something to consider okay guys uh  
we're going to wrap up with that I hope this was 
useful for you guys you can use this exercise and  
play around with ranges and I think it's very 
useful to see the difference and actually be  
looking at a realistic representation of strategy 
and ranges when you practice there is no reason  
to to do things with imaginary ranges when you're 
playing against Real opponents and these programs  
can let you put in the ranges put in the SE 
batting strategies there is a lot of flexibility  
and once you kind of see the principles and the 
range interactions you can hopefully take it from  
there and generalize to your play at the tables 
hope you guys enjoy this one and until next time
