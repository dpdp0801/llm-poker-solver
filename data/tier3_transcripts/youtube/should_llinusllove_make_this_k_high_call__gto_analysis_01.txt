### TOPIC: gto analysis
what's up guys welcome to the first
video of a series of videos going over
some high stakes hand histories
today we're going to be going over a
linus love hand at 5100
so let's just jump in
just to give a brief introduction to
myself my name is moneyjay2k
i play 200l online and 2-5 live
i'm a professional poker player and i've
spent hundreds of hours studying
theory hopefully together we will be
able to learn and take some principles
from
these different hands and apply it to
our own games so let's just jump right
into the hand history and just replay
the hand
and just see what our first impressions
are so we
face an open of about 2.25 x on the
button we're in the small blind
king queen off a pretty reasonable three
bet we're gonna be pretty much pure
three betting king queen off here
and we get the call from the button we
see a flop
a seven three rainbow again both players
are gonna have
some good asex here um we're obviously
gonna have some ace king we're gonna
have some ace queen
but button will have some sevens and
some threes and
but however the the main part of our
range is going to be
kings through eights that's gonna be a
huge part of our range advantage
and so we're gonna be able to see bet
this at a really high frequency
for a pretty small size and that's
exactly what linus does
he bets about quarter pot and we get the
call from ac1dd
go to a turn a73 jack of clubs
and we put in a pretty small bet about
one third one quarter here and it's
pretty interesting this is
going to be a basically a result of
having a really high range advantage
just on the flop as well as on the turn
and so we're gonna be wanting to bet the
turn at another really high frequency
but also we don't need to use very large
sizes in general in three bet pots
simply because the sbr is so low that
the
river we won't have any problem getting
more money in the pot we can always
jam the river with almost any size on on
the turn
we face a raise on the button with king
queen off here
and so we're gonna have to peel this and
this is mainly because
we beat all of his bluffs and then we
also have
outs to the nuts and so we we can
actually beat some of his value at a low
frequency
however the main part of calling this
hand is that he's not raising hands like
7x and 3x very often
and he's mainly raising some flush draws
he's raising some
hands that are like gut shots and stuff
like that
and so we're going to be able to be
beating those with the king high
and the queen high especially because
we're going to be beating all the
all the different gut shots and stuff
that he ends up raising
and so we we're going to need to call
this here even though it doesn't feel
great
however it does feel pretty good when
you river the straight and so
he bets all in here for about pot
and this is obviously just going to be a
slam dunk call
not really anything else we can do here
especially the king clubs
we call he shows the h jack and
whole hand is played very well for both
players ace jack is obviously a raise on
the turn he's got top two pair
and he really just got rivered linus ran
very good in this hand
so now i'm gonna jump over to gto wizard
and we're just going to pull it put in
the spot in the software
and we're going to be able to pull it up
fairly quickly so it's a 73 rainbow
so a73 with the three of hearts put it
in
and so now we see the solution for the
small blind
seabedding range here and so
just about as we expected we have about
20 percent
and 54 are pretty much the only sizes
used
we're only checking 23.7 percent so from
the overall perspective we're basically
betting about
73 of the time 76 percent of the time
and for a pretty small size about 20
and the reason for this if we go over
here and we can see
just how many sets and two pairs and top
pairs and whatnot that we have
we basically have a slight disadvantage
between the sets and two pairs so if we
look at the sets here
he has villain has 4.2 so the button has
4.2
percent of sets and we only have 3.3
so he has a slight advantage in the sets
and then we only have 1.1 percent of two
pair
and the button has 1.7 percent so he
again he has a slight advantage on sets
and two pairs
however in three bet pots it isn't quite
that important because if he has a set
and we have a hand like you know ace
king he's just getting all the money
and that's primarily a factor of just
the stack to pot ratio being so small
and being
just where we can't face a ton of
aggression from the button
whereas in a single a spot the button
could go over bet over bet over bet
and a lot of our top pair hands are
gonna end up having to fold because
they're facing 2x pot over bets
however in three bet pots the button
really can't do that the button can only
go
half pot half pot half pot or maybe one
over bet jam
but it's we're gonna be able to face
much less aggression
simply just because our stack to part
ratio is much smaller so
the the the slight disadvantage we have
in sets and two pair
isn't going to be that definitive of
what our overall strategy is
in this specific spot our overall
strategy is going to be much more
defined by the marginal hands
and this is also pretty common in
general when we're flop c betting
our marginal hands are hands like top
pair
top pair some low kicker hands like like
a6
ace four ace fives some ace ten off ace
jack off
and then then some under pairs where we
add in like kings queens jacks tens
nines and eights
um where a lot of these can bet really
small and get
value from hands like backdoor flush
draws hands like gut shots hands like 7x
3x and and whatnot
and so these are really the primary
reason
why this 20 percent size is used such as
such a high frequency
and so just to apply this to our game in
general when we're the three better and
the board is disconnected with a high
card
so disconnected with like a king or a
queen
or an ace or sometimes a jack we can
generally just bet almost our entire
range for a really small size
just because when we're the three better
our pre-flop range is just uncapped
and so we really get to get away with
all kinds of
very small bets at really high
frequencies and if we just put in the
the 20 bet size we see that
we actually have almost no fold equity
and a lot of players
don't want to use these really small
sizes these 20
sizes these 33 sizes because they say
oh my bluffs will never get folds and
the the response to this is basically we
don't want
folds when you're at an entire range
advantage when every single part of your
range except here of course is the top
two percent of the range we're not um
we don't have an advantage there but the
rest the top 98
or the bottom 98 of our range we are
basically
pretty far ahead of the of the of the
buttons range here so we actually want
calls
we because we're so far ahead with our
range we are not afraid of calls because
he's
primarily going to be calling with hands
that are worse than our hands
if we just look at some of the some of
the calls he has to come up with here i
mean
he has to call with with nine eight with
the back door back door and that's not
even that's not even the craziest i mean
he has to call with ten eight he has to
call with jack eight
he has to call with hands like pocket
twos he has to call
basically every pair has to call um
there there's
quite a lot of hands here that maybe
players either aren't finding and then
the
that is just completely printing but
even if they are finding
there's going to be a lot of tough plays
that they're going to have to play on
the turn with a lot of these different
hands
and they're also going to have to raise
a lot so if we look at
he needs to raise 12 he needs to raise
about 14 percent of the time
and again it's going to be a lot of
different hands that don't always make a
lot of sense
and so basically when we use this really
small bet here
this this 20 pot size bet we just
end up putting our opponent in some
spots where
he has to play some pretty large pots
with some pretty marginal hands so
this really small size is something
that's really really really really
high value and something that we can put
into our game very quickly
and it's pretty easy to do right like
for us all we have to do is bet 20
and we put the button in all kinds of
interesting spots he
has to start calling he has to start
raising with hands that he may not
really want to raise
and so it's a really good strategy both
theoretically and exploitatively
but anyways we put in the 20 pop bet
and the button ends up ends up calling
we're going to jump over to the turn
jack of club turn
and so here we're actually betting an
even higher frequency than we were on
the flop and again
it's just a it's just a factor that we
have a huge range advantage still we
have
we have a ton of different high quality
hands here
that we simply just can bet for
almost whatever size we want however
in this specific in this specific spot
we start betting this 20
size fairly often and then this 56 size
and so again i think a lot of players
will make the mistake of using some
larger sizes here they'll start using
some 25 big blinds into 32 big lines you
know some 80 percent of pots
90 of pots some players will even just
jam because they're afraid of the flush
draw
and that that is a pretty big mistake
and so the reason it's a mistake
is that we are almost always in a
three-bet pot
we're almost always trying to get the
hand trying to get our good
high-value hands in over three streets
and so basically we are always trying to
bet the
flop a size where we can bet the turn a
size where we can jam the river for
about half pot to a pot so we were
basically to put in a sentence we are
trying to set up
the river svr to be
between about .5 and 1 spr
and we can't always do that sometimes
it's it's not reasonable but in this
specific spot that's the main reason
that we're using
this 56 pot size here and not using some
larger sizes we're really trying to
force
our opponent to put in um to get to put
a lot of money in
with a pretty wide range if we look here
he's only folding 40 percent against
this half pot
size and so he's still having to call
with every flush draw he's having to
call
he's having to call with nine seven even
raising it sometimes he's having a call
with eight seven he's having a call with
gut shots like six
five and five four he's having to call
with
with just some some second pairs like
king jack even some players
aren't calling king jack here and that's
that's a pretty big mistake
he's having a call with nines and tens
and and this is against the half pot
size
um so so the half plot size is is is
used primarily because when we hit call
and we just put in some some random
river
our sbr is we're betting we have about
66.5 behind
and the pod is 68 so we can jam for
roughly
um for roughly pot so we don't really
need to jam the turn because we can very
naturally and easily jam the river
and in situations where you know if he
rivers the flush he just
usually is just going to get the money
because the ranges are so wide that his
whole range isn't just flushes
but to go back to the actual line and go
back to the turn and we actually
can put in the other line so that's the
reason why we use this 56
size i think this is a pretty standard
spot i think
a lot of mid stakes players 100 and l
and up will be able to find this 56
percent size
however i don't think many players are
finding this 20 percent size either
and the 20 sizes is a factor of that
very large range
advantage and the 20 size is a little
bit of of
trying to just it's basically just
trying to get a lot more thin value
and so if we if we filter by this 20
size and we
go through some of the different hands
that are betting we're betting hands
like jack
ten we're betting hands like jack nine
we're betting these second pair into
this twenty percent size
we're putting um we're putting a lot of
hands that can go for some thin value
like pocket tens pocket nines pocket
eights
pocket sevens um and a lot of these are
just
they're they're i guess pocket sevens is
a set but um these hands are all
just going to be able to get called by a
lot worse hands
um like like if we just think about
having like a hand like jacked tin here
um we're getting called by
uh every king ten we're getting called
by every gut shot getting called by
every king queen every king
king queen off every king jack off we're
getting called by jack eight suited jack
nine suited
um we're getting called by all every
single 7x we're getting called by
gut shots we're getting we're getting
called by just
all kinds of different hands that we're
beating um we're also getting called by
a lot of flushes
um so if we just filter by by the by the
club hands
we're getting called by a lot of flush
draws like hands hands that
just don't get to fold for 20 size and
we get we get to get value from these
flushes we're not really that afraid of
the flush
um we're trying to get value from these
flush draws and i think it's a common
misconception that
we need to be very afraid of the flush
draw
we really don't we want to give value
from the flush draw we want the flush
draws to call most the time
and so if we go moving forward we bet
that 20
size and we end up actually getting
raised in the hand
which he needs to do quite often
actually if we look at the raise size
and or and the raise range he's he's
raising uh
let's filter by the raise range he's
raising these king eight suited hands
he's raising top pair
top top pair and um two pairs if we look
at he's raising ace nine ace eight
ace three another two pair hand ace ten
ace jack he has
he has value here he has sevens he has
he has threes he has he has a good
amount of value here so he
he can he can find these raises he has h
jack so he definitely wants to have a
raise range because if we have ace jack
or we have a7 or we have sevens
we want to put money in the middle we
want to we want to
bloat up the pot so that we can jam the
river again
and and then we just look at some of the
bluffs he has he's bluffing you know
he's bluffing these these club hands
he's bluffing
king six and king eight and king nine
and king queen um king queen of clubs
here
he's bluffing these different um these
different gut shots and
and he's even bluffing some third pair
but very very low frequency and
that's actually important for for our
hand if we if we just simply look at um
how often he's bluffing a pair
he's it's very very very very low
frequency that he bluffs a pair
most of the time it's these hands like
10 8 and 9 8 and what in the in these
gut shots and whatnot and he's very
rarely raising with a hand like seven
six and eight seven and so if we look at
our
our range um as as as the small blind
versus it
we end up calling king queen off at a
frequency
that is notable where yes we're raising
it a good amount and
and we're calling it a good amount and
we're folding so it's mixed and this
just means that this is what's
theoretically called a bluff catcher and
a bluff catcher
basically just means that you're beating
all the bluffs but you don't beat any
value
and so you're gonna call the the perfect
frequency
that will balance your overall range so
that your opponent
can't just raise every single hand and
get you to fold way too much
so this is basically a bluff catcher is
just a hand that's used to balance your
range
in in order to make sure that your
opponent can't bluff
too often and this is probably where
where linus makes the a very small
mistake
he he really should only be jamming or
folding the king of clubs in
the king of club hands and this goes
back
to the raise range that that the button
has if we pull up the raise range and we
just put in
and we we put in these club hands again
he has
a lot of his raises are like king six
king eight king nine
king queen and so having the king of
clubs blocks all of these different
races
and so it actually blocks a lot of the
bluffs
and that just when you when you block a
lot of the buffs it obviously just means
that
your opponent has a lot of
a higher frequency of value in their
range because you block their bluff the
king of club doesn't really block any
um doesn't really block a whole lot of
value bets on on
on the turn that raise um
and so so when when we go back to um go
back to the the raise range and we call
we do end up getting to call king queen
off a little bit
um just because of that and going
through
and and so so we can see that the non
the non-club king queens
actually do call a sizeable percentage
and then they fold a little bit
and then the king of clubs jam over the
top i don't think this is a very big
mistake from linus obviously
um he's he also could be exploiting his
specific players
and i i don't think it's it's it's a
super it's a it's a big deal to make
this mistake at all
um going through some of just the other
hands that we have
that end up calling um our bluff
catchers or hands like nines tens
eights and um we i would not recommend
most players to be calling these hands
simply because
your opponent is not bluffing enough
most most opponents
do not find this raise on the turn and
so we
really do end up getting to fold out a
lot of these bluff catchers
however when you're playing you know
stakes like 5100
your opponent might be finding these
bluffs and
they're definitely they're definitely
they may even be over bluffing these
spots
and so we we do have to actually call
these these kind of hands
at the highest stakes however if you're
playing micros if you're playing 100 and
l if you're playing 200 and l
these guys just aren't bluffing these
spots nearly as high of a frequency as
they need to be
and so we can turn a lot of these bluff
catchers into pure folds
um moving forward i think i think it's
it's a pretty good simplification if we
if
to just to just fold a lot of your bluff
catchers
when you face high aggression i think
most stakes
these lines are under bluffed and we can
we can pretty comfortably just fold the
hands like king queen
however again linus is playing 5100
he has to make some of these calls that
may not always feel great
so linus puts in the call
and the river was the ten of clubs
another pretty interesting river and
obviously
one of the better rivers for our exact
hand now we beat a ton of value
we obviously check our entire range and
maybe maybe that isn't obvious so the
reason we can't really
um we can't really we can't really donk
on this river very much
and i think a lot of players would also
make that mistake
of donking this river a little bit too
often when they hit their flush
in that we really don't have many
flushes here
and that's might seem a little
unintuitive but when we bet this 20
size very few um very few of
our flushes are going into it these
these aren't
really um these aren't really being put
into our 20
size and when we do get raised they
really aren't calling very much
and we go back and put in the clubs very
few of these are calling and then when
we have this this king of club hands
it's just um it's just not it's just not
going to be a very high frequency play
for us to have many flushes
so we hit call confirm
and so this isn't exactly zero percent
this is actually if we turn on the
weight these hands are almost never in
our range
if we turn on range height so
it's just a rounding error
and we hit check so obviously we're
checking our range because we have very
few flushes
and if we go over to him he has 6.6
percent of flushes he has
he has he has um even straight flushes
so he has a pretty large range advantage
on this
on this on this board and it makes sense
he raised the turn so he has a lot more
high value hands
and so he's jamming what is going to be
a pretty nutted range he's going to be
jamming king queen here
he's going to be jamming um top top two
pair here he's going to be jamming all
the nut flushes obviously he's going to
be jamming some of these
um eight seven hands even to to balance
his reign some nine eight hands
that just that just hit that um that
straight on the river
he's gonna have some sets he's gonna
have he's gonna have quite a lot of
different hands here and if we turn on
range height we can see
that a lot of um his highest frequency
hands are like ace jack
um king queen some sevens he's gonna
have a lot of sets here
and so when we face the jam with king
queen
it's pretty much it's pretty much just a
slam dunk call
and as as just the um solve pretty much
says
king queen is beating just a ton of
value here
even though even though we may not have
um we may not have the flush
we still are just having to snap call
with king queen off here it's it's
going to be um it's going to be just
winning a ton
um and and we're even calling like ace
queen we're even calling ace king
we're having to call um we're having to
call pretty wide here again because
if villain hit a set if villain hit a
flush he just gets the money
we we beat tons of bluffs he's jamming
fairly wide if we go back to his jam
range he he he is jamming
a lot of these different bluffs he's
jamming 870 he's jamming
um hands like six five and five four and
even like pocket twos and
pocket fours and pocket fives and pocket
sixes
um he's bluffing a pretty high frequency
here and
um and so so we really can't get away
with folding these top pair hands
especially when we're only
we're only facing a pot bet so we we
don't need to be
we don't need to be right very often
we'll and so
these these top end um top pair top pair
top kicker hands
while they maybe look very low ev if we
switch over to the ev line here
they only have 0.77 ev 0.46
0.28 they're they're very low ev but
they do
still have to call and so it's important
to know that and if we look at the
the eevee of the king queen hands they
have huge amounts of ev here and so
folding these
would be very bad and so the the river
kind of ends up playing itself if we go
back to strategy
the river we call a lot of really good
hands if we go over to filters
we're calling a hundred percent of sets
hundred percent of straight 100 of
flushes
100 of the straight flushes and then
we're we're going to be mixing with the
two pair we're going to be mixing
mixing with the top pair so basically
we're calling our best our best two pair
here not calling um
ace 10 and jack 10 and instead we're um
we're also mixing with the top pairs
where we're only calling the top end top
pairs as well
and i i think this river is is fairly
intuitive i think a lot of players will
be able to find these calls and
i don't think many players are going to
be folding king queen here so that's
i don't think many players are even
folding sets here
and so i i think this is um pretty well
played by both players i think
obviously ace jack is good enough to get
it in when we're calling with hands like
ace king and ace queen and whatnot
and so i think it's a very well played
hand and that makes a lot of sense given
that it's 5100
so that's going to be the end of the
hand history part of this video
there's going to be a series of these
kinds of videos so if you would

reviewed or possibly even your own hand
reviewed
leave a link to that hand in the
