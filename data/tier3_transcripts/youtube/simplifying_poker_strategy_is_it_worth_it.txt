### TOPIC: simplifying poker strategy
should you study a complex poker strategy 
with many different sizes or should you  
use a simplified strategy that's easier 
to learn in today's lecture I'm going  
to go over the trade-offs between 
complexity and simplicity and I'm  
going to show you how you can get 
the most value from your study time

in today's video I'm going to cover the trade-offs 
between a complex and a simplified strategy we'll  
also go over custom solving best practices and I'm 
going to show you how to use GTO wizard to build a  
simplified strategy then I'm going to show you a 
way you can prioritize spots so we can figure out  
what are the most valuable spots you should be 
practicing for your current stage in your poker  
development and finally we'll look at how you can 
practice against your own custom built Solutions  
did you know that more than 95 percent of GTO 
wizard nodes have never been observed by the  
human eye that's wild to think about in fact 
the vast majority of the GTO wizard library  
has never been viewed not once and the reason is 
that if you look at any typical GTO solution from  
flop to River there can be tens of millions of 
decision points tens of millions considering all  
of the different possible runouts and batch sizes 
and lines that can occur and so it goes to show  
that as a human thinking about poker you really 
don't need the world's most complex strategy in  
order to develop strong poker skills as a human 
you're not trying to memorize you're trying to  
learn in heuristics so how do we navigate the 
tightrope between complexity and simplicity  
well let's start by examining the trade-offs the 
simplified strategy is easier to implement it's  
less noisy because it's easier to solve easier to 
study because you're using fewer bet sizes and it  
less accurately represents the game Space this is 
the main trade-off if you give a solver one bet  
size for example it may exploit the limitations of 
your bedding tree so that can make it less robust  
if a solver wasn't expecting to see for example 
an over bet or some pot sized rays in some spot  
the strategy it outputs isn't necessarily going 
to be good when you map it to the actual real  
game however complex strategies also have some 
problems so they're harder to implement right  
good luck implementing a four sizing split on any 
flop that's crazy it's a lot more noisy harder to  
study but it does more accurately represent the 
game Space and it's more robust that is to say  
it is less exploitable to bet sizes and raise 
sizes outside of its abstraction now each of  
these have some use case complex strategies are 
great for examining for example bet sizing Theory  
or seeing how you should defend against uncommon 
lines and simplified strategies in my opinion are  
better for practicing against better for trying 
to find something really implementable but ideally  
we want the Best of Both Worlds and that's why 
we invented Dynamic solving so Dynamic solving  
is our algorithm that automatically simplifies 
and optimizes bet sizes at every decision point  
it's easier to study it finds optimal batch sizes 
it's easier to solve and it's robust meaning it's  
less exploitable than a simple strategy when you 
use Dynamic sizing you're not telling the solver  
to choose one size in every spot you're telling 
it to choose the optimal bet size in every spot  
according to the ranges the stack the pot and 
the specific cards on the board that you're  
currently looking at so the natural follow-up to 
this question is what happens when you simplify  
your strategy to one size how does the GTO 
strategy change as compared to something more  
complex that's using many sizes and what you'll 
find if you play around with this tool is that  
the solution will often bet more than usual when 
you lower the average bet size and it's going to  
bet less often when you increase the average bet 
size you will also typically see that when you're  
putting many different hands into the same batch 
size you have less of an opportunity to polarize  
and therefore the defender typically calls just 
a little bit wider however the total amount of  
money going into the pot is often very similar and 
moreover the expected value is almost identical  
so people think that there's a huge EV loss from 
simplifying your strategy the truth is not really  
it's very very minute the real benefits to a more 
complex strategy are like things like you can  
study batch sizing Theory and perhaps your line 
makes a bit more sense for your hand class but as  
far as the expected value of complications go you 
would be amazed how small they are so the easiest  
way for me to show you this is to Simply dive into 
some GTO wizard examples and going to show you how  
to set this up and we'll compare one spot for my 
first example I've selected a cut off versus big  
blind single raised pot on 1095 two-tone action 
checks to the aggressor and here you can see  
they're using many different sizes now if you want 
to follow along I'm using these NL 500 General  
Solutions these are highly accurate Solutions and 
they're sold with many different sizes so they're  
quite robust and a little complex and we'll see 
here that the solver in this spot wants to split  
all different sizes it likes some over bedding 
it likes the 75 percent it likes the half pot  
even a little bit of 33 percent the solver has no 
qualms splitting four different sizes now you may  
be wondering why on Earth would the silver want to 
choose four different batch sizes well you have to  
keep in mind that a GTO solver doesn't care about 
your feelings and it doesn't care how complicated  
the strategy is the only thing it cares about 
is maximizing expected value at all costs right  
and if it's going to take four sizes to do that 
then that's what it's going to choose even if a  
one sizing strategy is you know only loses like 
point one percent it doesn't care it's going to  
use the more complex strategy so I'm going to 
show you how we can simplify this down to one  
size and then we're going to compare how much EV 
that loses and how the opponent's response and  
how our strategy changes so I'm going to go build 
a new solution that only uses one of these sizes  
hit the solution selector in the top left corner 
and then select the custom Solutions tab from here  
we're going to build our own brand new solution so 
the first thing we're going to do here is figure  
out the ranges bot size and stack size and instead 
of filling all of this out manually I'm just going  
to import it so I'll hit this little pre-fill 
button I'm going to select cut off versus big  
blind single raised pot okay and we can see that 
this is populated both the players ranges stack  
and pot size next we're going to build the bedding 
tree now if you don't want to do this you can just  
hit automatic that's fine I'm going to model 
it so that it's using the same sizes that we  
had in the general solution so we had a 33 bet we 
had a half pot bet we had a 75 and a 125 and the  
raised sizes are always half pot full pot and 
all in one Eid is just a geometric sizing that  
just means get it in over one bet or in this case 
shoving I could customize it further but this is  
enough to make a simple example so we'll go ahead 
and create this new solution and we will select  
10 9 5 2 Tone same situation same ranges same 
boards the only difference now is that the  
solver has automatically simplified my strategy 
to use one bet size so the first thing to note  
is that I didn't tell it's 275 percent the 
dynamic sizing algorithm says here are four  
or five or six different sizes to choose from 
choose me the size that makes the most money  
and in this case on this board given these ranges 
that happens to be about 75 pot however if we go  
ahead and change this board so 987 it's going to 
prefer a different bet size so here it actually  
prefers the half pot size on 987 what if we pick 
something dry for example uh King five five well  
now it's probably gonna down bet I expect it'll 
use a small bat size here and indeed it does now  
it wants the BET small 33 percent okay well what 
if we give it something like Ace King six rainbow  
well now it's probably gonna over bet because 
this is a very good board's over bet and indeed  
it does so depending on what parameters it's 
receiving it will change and optimize the BET size  
automatically simplifying between whatever sizes 
you've chilled it to choose from okay so now that  
we understand the dynamic solving algorithm let's 
go back to my original solve here so what would  
happen if we were to change this bet size what if 
we simplify to something else instead for example  
perhaps you prefer a smaller bet on this board 
what you're going to notice is that it's going to  
bet more often and this should be kind of obvious 
to the more advanced players but here I've told it  
to bet third pot and we'll give it a second and 
you can see that the BET sizing increases we're  
almost betting two-thirds of the time now this is 
because we're putting in less money into the pot  
with this third pot bet and therefore it wants to 
bet more frequently and conversely we could do the  
opposite test what happens if we pump this up like 
a pot sized bet we're going to see that now it's  
betting less often okay and so the the amount 
you can bet is closely tied to what's called a  
betting volume which basically indicates the total 
average EV of money you're putting into the pot so  
if you want a bit larger you have to bet less 
frequently if you want to bet smaller you have  
to bend more frequently and so on and so forth 
now that said some boards are going to have more  
efficient sizings than others so for example if I 
change this to like something like King 4 4 what  
ends up happening is that it wants to use a very 
small size and the larger size just isn't going to  
be super efficient here so for example here's 
uh you know about 61 percent for a small size  
if I put this up to like a pot sized bet we're 
going to find that it can't fit very often at all  
so it's only betting 22 percent of the time 
this is a very inefficient sizing given how  
polarized big blinds range is big blinds range is 
mostly going to be uh nuts or air at this point  
and in fact we're betting so little that they 
even are going to start to develop a docking  
strategy conversely if we change this to something 
that prefers an overbed like Ace King six again  
could see that the default GTO strategy is to 
over bet bet 125 pot here now what happens if  
we were to give it a small size I know a lot of 
players like to just range bet these boards for  
a small size well we're going to find that 
it's just gonna range BET right this is such  
an advantageous board that you can just bet super 
wide this is a playable strategy you're not going  
to get as much money with your knotted hands for 
example but it's still a playable strategy and so  
overall the goal is to put in approximately 
the same amount of money uh overall now I'm  
going to change this back to I'm going to 
change this back to my original solution  
and here we're going to compare this strategy 
against the general Solutions so first thing  
we'll notice is that it's betting a little bit 
less often compared to the general solution here  
we can see the original pre-sold solution which 
used many different sizes and it's only checking  
44 of the time if we simplify that we can see it's 
betting 55 of the time and in our simplified case  
it's betting less often and this is because 
again we've averaged up we've uh increased  
the amount of money we're putting into the 
bot with this one bed size so it's gonna bet  
a little little less frequently but it's pretty 
close to Optimal next I'm going to show you how  
to compare EV properly in GTO wizard so the way 
to do this is to select the ranges Tab and this  
is a really important step always select the 
root node that is to say the very first decision  
point in the solution and the reason for this is 
that the ranges can change if you change the the  
BET sizings and so it's best practice to always 
compare at the root over here we see the expected  
value of both players 1.88 for big blind 3.22 
for the cutoff and these numbers in white here  
this is the EV as a percentage of the pot so 
cutoff's expected value is 3.22 big blinds all  
right let's go ahead and just write that down 
so simplified strategy wins 3.22 big blinds now  
let's see what happens if I amend cutoff strategy 
I'm going to give them small size a medium size  
larger size some over bet and you know what let's 
go ahead and just give them an all in as well how  
will that change the expected value now I could 
compare to the general Solutions but keep in mind  
that these GTA wizard AI solutions for now don't 
have any rakes so I'm using this to get a fair  
comparison and what you'll notice if we go back 
through node is that the expected value doesn't  
really change at all uh it's still 3.22 big blinds 
so more complex strategy 3.2 to it the EV change  
is basically non-existent on this particular flop 
now some spots it's definitely going to change so  
for example if I give them an inappropriate batch 
size so let's say third pot here it's not a great  
sizing for this board we're going to see that 
the EV at the root node will definitely decrease  
okay so instead of 3.22 now it's 3.2 so we lost 
0.2 big lines again it just doesn't feel like  
we've lost much at all right uh you know it's 
less than a percent loss but you really need  
to put this into perspective guys because EV on 
the Flop even if you give it the worst possible  
betting tree which is no betting tree so I'm 
just going to get rid of I'm gonna force it to  
check back everything and you'll see here like 
it's not allowed to bet well notice that the EV  
oh what's this what's this the Eevee's gone up 
no again this is why you compare at the root  
note because big blind now that they know cutoff 
won't bet has a donking strategy and so if you  
want to compare fairly you have to compare at the 
root node so cutoff CV has become 3.04 in this  
case this is our lower bound the worst possible 
betting strategy we could give it winds 3.04 and  
so realistically typically speaking if you give 
your solver a really bad tree the expected value  
as a percentage of the pot will just approach 
the equity and if you're doing this on earlier  
streets like a flop you can always make up for 
that on turn and River it can kind of compensate  
for whatever terrible betting tree you've given 
it by you know betting more on later straights for  
example now that said we can see here that Eevee 
loss of complex versus simple strategies really  
there's there's not a big difference guys and 
anyone who's telling you like you know you need to  
play a more complex strategy to win more money I 
don't really buy that anymore to be honest I just  
don't think that there's going to be a huge EV 
difference one caveat I should warn you guys about  
is that GTA wizard AI uses neural networks to 
estimate the expected value so this is not going  
to be accurate to like 0.0001 accuracy whatever 
right you have to always consider that there's  
some margin of error in here typically about point 
two point three percent of the pot is is going  
to be the margin of error now with all that said 
let's talk a little more about complex strategies  
a lot of people they think that you know it's 
one or the other it has to be either super simple  
super complex but realistically there's there's 
quite a lot of room to adjust and those complex  
strategies still have their place because they 
could take your opponent out of their game tree  
and in chess you might call this a Gambit in 
poker we often see Pros like Stefan doing this  
for example and it reminds me of a famous chess 
player Michael tal who said Sometimes you have  
to take your opponent into a deep dark Forest 
where one plus one equals three and the path  
out is only wide enough for one uh his quote being 
that sometimes you got to take your opponent off  
their game in order to win anyway that's enough 
chess theory for now let's get back to Poker so  
something I've done to try and double check this 
is uh graph the expected value of just a ton of  
different boards and spots here depending on 
what size we chose and in this case we can see  
that well 25 percent 42 71 percent 100 125 we 
can see that it the expected value change that  
is to say the difference compared to having no 
bet size uh Max is out to round this 70 Mark  
right uh and on some boards that's what happens 
on other boards you're going to see it's a little  
more flat so you'll see like many different 
sizes are fine on some boards we get more of  
a hump where one size is best uh depending on how 
many different playable strategies there are but  
overall uh the EV difference is not huge right 
it's a you know this one scales between zero and  
3.6 percent between the worst and the best size 
so simply put simplifying doesn't lose a whole  
lot of EV on the Flop anyway uh because it can 
course correct later straights so a concept I've  
referenced throughout this video is what's called 
betting volume and this is just a fancy way for  
saying how much money you're putting into the pot 
right now you might as well just call it average  
bet size it means the same thing so the way you 
quantify this is to take the sum of the sizes  
times the frequencies that means bet size 1 times 
frequency one plus bet size 2 times frequency two  
and so on until you get some average bet size now 
if we do that with our original strategies we're  
looking at this is the general solution which had 
a more complex strategy four different batch sizes  
four different frequencies uh here I'm showing 
it in big blinds rather than percentage of pots  
just for clarity works out to two big blinds so 
in this case we were betting on average between  
all four of these sizes two big blinds into a 5.1 
big blind pot okay now let's go take a look at the  
simplified strategy well again here we can see 
3.8 big blinds times 51.7 percent and that works  
out to about two big blinds again it is a very 
small difference here but essentially the solver  
is going to try and fight to use approximately 
the same betting volume in a lot of cases not  
always but in a lot of cases if you bet bigger 
it's going to bet less frequently if you bet  
smaller it's going to bet more often depending 
on the efficiency of the BET size so generally  
speaking even when you simplify it's still going 
to be putting in the same amount of money overall  
as long as you're using some reasonable sizes 
so going back we answered all of these questions  
already we can see that how often we bet is 
largely dependent on whether or not we're sizing  
up or down and it's going to try and make it so 
it's a similar betting volume overall and we saw  
that simplifying well on the Flop especially 
doesn't lose much EV at all so the reason to  
play a more complex strategy is not to make more 
money let's just admit that right off the bat the  
theoretical gain from a complex strategy is well 
basically below the margin that we can accurately  
measure EV all right it's that small so the 
reason to play a more complex strategy has to do  
with things like bet sizing theory has to do with 
whether or not you want to take your opponent off  
their game whether you think you can exploit some 
sort of bet sizing elasticity tendency of those or  
if you just like to mix it up right what is not 
a real argument is saying that you play a more  
complex strategy because it's higher EV because 
frankly it's just not really much higher EP okay  
so let's move on to another test that we can do 
and this is something we did to Benchmark our  
Dynamic solving algorithm and to do this we tested 
500 heads up River spots to find out why River  
spots well because on the river you can't course 
correct later streets and the solver will lose the  
maximum amount of money so we wanted to deliver 
the most pain possible to our simplifications uh  
really just just punish it as hard as possible as 
it turns out compared to playing a very complex  
strategy on the river our Dynamic solving 
algorithm loses about point three percent  
pot as compared to playing a very complex strategy 
with like six or seven different sizes and we also  
tested against the single best size so that is to 
say our Dynamic algorithm tried to find the best  
size and then we solved all the sizes manually 
and compared turns out uh yeah also barely losing  
an EV so it's a pretty accurate algorithm so my 
point is simply that Dynamic solving by itself is  
is pretty accurate as far as it goes it's not 
going to lose much EV compared to playing any  
other one size strategy and compared to playing 
some impossibly complex strategy that you have no  
chance of implementing uh it loses maybe a third 
of the pot so simplifying down to one size really  
doesn't lose much EV on the Flop and even on 
the river if you want to learn more about these  
benchmarks we have an article I'll link that in 
the description something else I want to show you  
guys is what is the optimal bet size so we didn't 
just compare the dynamic sizing algorithm we also  
tried to find the best possible bet size on the 
river if you're going to simplify to one size  
and so what we did is we measured the EV loss 
of playing for example half pot bats in every  
single spot compared to the more complex strategy 
so out of position we can see that out of position  
prefers about a half pot bed this uh had the 
lowest median loss rate of about 0.39 so if you're  
going to simplify to one size out of position on 
the river about a half pot bet should do it in  
position preferred a larger size so we can see 
the the size that lost the least was about 75  
percent now that said there are some boards that 
really wanted to go pot or a little bit bigger  
but if you're going to go one size everywhere 75 
percent to 100 percent in position on the river is  
the way to go and I'll be honest I was a little 
surprised to see how little simplifying to one  
size loses and we could see Dynamic of course 
had the best performance because it's going to  
use a smaller bet when appropriate and a larger 
bet when appropriate but hey if you really want  
to simplify here's the numbers for you so you can 
have a look at this play around with this graph  
and let me know what you guys think let's talk 
about custom solving best practices so I've shown  
you how to experiment with it a bit but the very 
first thing you should do if you're new to this  
is read the guides we have built an extensive 
database of guides that teach you everything  
there is to know about custom solving we've 
got these videos we've got this overview page  
we've got this article that'll walk you through 
how to build custom Solutions all right so you  
can see how to get started building the bedding 
tree saving loading organizing everything you need  
to know is in these guides you want to learn how 
to train against your Solutions how to practice  
against them we have a guide for that as well 
right here how to train against custom Solutions  
okay it's actually pretty straightforward if you 
have just some common questions and you want to  
try and find a quick answer well we've got that 
here as well so the very first thing to do is to  
read the guides and master the tools that way you 
can get the most value from your subscription the  
next thing to do when you're building a betting 
tree is to space your bet sizes far apart  
realistically a solver is going to have a very 
hard time distinguishing between the trade-offs  
of a 55 and a 67 pot size bed you really need to 
space those bet sizes further apart don't try and  
use like a million sizes and Clump them close 
together it's not a good idea what I typically  
suggest is to have three sizes your small medium 
and big bet but you should also pay attention  
to the stack to pot ratio for example if you're 
studying a four bet pot where there's only like an  
spr of two uh you're not going to need an overbed 
right maybe your biggest size would be like you  
know maybe use like 20 percent fifty percent all 
in that's plenty good enough for like a four bed  
pot but in a single raised pot for example you 
might want to spread it out a bit more you know 33  
75 125 spread your bat sizes out a little bit and 
that brings me to my next point which is to reuse  
the bedding trees okay you don't need to remake 
the bedding tree each and every time if you've  
gone and customized sizes for your specific spot 
you can reuse those and let me show you how so I'm  
back in my custom solution here I'll hit edit 
here and here we can see that we've built this  
specific bed sizing scheme this one's not overly 
complicated but what we can do is just save it  
and we'll call this my betting tree okay and save 
this as a new bedding tree and we can also go and  
load old ones so here we see I have all of these 
different bedding tree schemes and I can go and  
reuse these for different spots something else I 
can do is I can choose to only load the BET sizes  
right so for example here's my more simplified 
one that I use for practicing against the solution  
this is again this is same ranges same stack same 
pot but now I'm using my pre-loaded bedding tray  
which has three batch sizes and is uh pretty 
easy to to play next you'll want to make sure  
that if you're doing any sort of EV comparisons 
always always compare at the root node of the  
solution rather than the current node and that's 
because players can change their strategies on  
earlier streets if you give them different sizes 
or node lock something so you want to be careful  
to compare the root node and finally uh just 
experiment right some people they don't want to  
experiment they just want to learn and study and 
memorize uh me personally I love making graphs and  
trying different things and giving it wacky sizes 
and trying to break it I love experimenting with  
silver because I can learn new ideas from changing 
the parameters and studying those underlying cause  
effect principles so don't be afraid to mess 
around with it and try something new if you've  
made it this far congratulations you're about to 
get the little pot of gold that I left at the end  
so one of the most common questions we get at GTA 
wizard is how do I prioritize spots what do I know  
what to study next and how do I quantify this 
that's what we're going to cover now so a spot  
in poker is like a button versus big blind single 
race pot cut off versus small blind three bed pot  
it's a configuration and so what we want to know 
is what configurations are the most important as  
in how much do they contribute to your win rate 
how do we quantify this and how do we figure out  
what we should practice next so I spent some time 
trying to quantify this now what most coaches and  
Stables are doing is they're calculating a sort 
of spot EV which is to say how often does the spot  
occur multiplied by how big the starting pot is so 
we're going to do just that let's figure out what  
configurations are the most valuable and how we 
can figure out what you should be practicing next  
so let me show you what I've done I have looked at 
42 different configurations starting from button  
versus big blend single raise pot all the way down 
to some of these three bad four bet pots and I've  
used special software to calculate the frequency 
that each of these spots occur accounting for card  
removal and bunching effect and all of that and 
then we have we know the starting pot size and we  
can calculate the expected value of that spot so 
for example a button versus big blind pod single  
raised pod occurs about five percent of the time 
in a GTO six Max game and I'm using um nl500 rake  
structure with GTO sizes here that means that this 
spot contributes significantly to our win rate  
because it occurs very frequently but we'll also 
see for example a button versus small blind single  
raised pod occurs infrequently it's not very 
common but because the pot is much bigger it has  
a larger impact on our win rate which we can see 
down here and so this EV column is basically just  
frequency times the pot size and that tells us how 
important different spots are to practice if we  
sort this from A to Z we'll see that most of these 
single raised pots these are going to be the most  
important followed by some of these three bet and 
four bed pots and if you're new to Poker what I  
would recommend is just take for example like the 
top five or ten spots here and just practice these  
first because these are going to have the most 
significant impact on your win rate now that said  
I clearly admit that for different formats for 
example if you're like a full ring live player I I  
kind of doubt that blind versus blind is the most 
common spot in a live cash game probably people  
are opening too wide so you get more of this 
stuff under the gun versus big blind kind of stuff  
or maybe you get more cold call spots like this 
regardless it gives us a nice starting place to  
figure out what the most important spots are 
now I wanted to improve on current methods  
that people are using so something else I 
did was to calculate the average pot size  
right on a button versus big line single race 
pod we start at five and a half big plans on  
the Flop but chances are people are gonna bet 
and put more money in and so I also calculated  
how big the average pot is going to be in GTL and 
you can change the EV calculation here so average  
pot size and this reorders uh the EVS a little 
bit but we still see very similar Trends overall  
and here we can see again which spots are going 
to be more important to us now I wanted to take  
it a step further because sure maybe we know 
like the top five 10 most important spots but  
um what if you want to practice certain spots what 
if you spend a lot of time practicing for example  
single race pots and so you're getting a decent 
score there in in our practice mode and this is  
just the GTO Wizard score so you can create like a 
drill for these single race pots and type in your  
score then what we're going to see is that there's 
a practice priority column and this indicates what  
you should practice next the way this one works is 
it looks at your GTA Wizard score and it says okay  
how much EV can we gain from practicing 
this spot next the way this works is by  
taking 1 minus your GTA Wizard score and then 
raising that to some power in this base I've  
chosen three and this just kind of reflects the 
fact that it's much easier to go from 70 to 80  
than it is to go from 80 to 90 or from 90 to 
95 so it respects the fact that spots are doing  
worse in like for example if I put in like an 
atrocious score in these four bed pots let's say  
50 or 50 it's going to say no you really ought to 
practice this next even though it's uncommon you  
can easily up your score here and gain a lot of 
win rate right uh so you can adjust this parameter  
I recommend a value between two and four uh 
and this just basically determines how much  
um it's gonna weigh your current GTR Wizard 
score and how much that should affect your  
practice priority so let's put that up to 70 
let's say for example that okay we know we're  
doing pretty good in single race pots what 
should we practice next okay well let me so  
sort the practice priority and okay we should do 
some button versus blind three bet pot stuff so  
let's say we practice that a bit and we bump our 
score up to let's say 80 and 82 percent okay now  
these are looking pretty good what should we 
do next well again I'm just going to sort this  
table and okay so now it's time for some cut 
and cut off versus button three bet pot stuff  
so we keep going like that uh slowly operating 
our score and improving one step at a time and  
again the goal of all of this is to just know 
where you should focus your attention next and  
how you can get the most value for your training 
time so that way you're not practicing spots that  
are going to add very little to your win rate 
you're practicing spots that are more important  
um now something else I wanted to do here was to 
look at the aggregated stats so I've grouped these  
in three different ways uh on the left hand 
side here what we see is pre-flop aggressor  
in position three bet pot or pre-flop aggressor 
out of position three bet pot so on and so forth  
we can see this is just the expected value that 
single race pots um by far in position single  
raised Parts is going to add the most to your 
win rate followed only by out of position so this  
includes blind versus blind and some cold call 
spots uh and Then followed by some three bad pots  
next I wanted to look at the you know just three 
bed pots four bed pots and single race pots now  
you may be tempted to think that um you know 
it's all Singularity spots but the fact is that  
uh single raised pots add a lot to your EV but 
sort of three bed pots there's more three bet  
pots in total so if we go take a look at the data 
we can see that there's a whole lot of red stuff  
here three bet pots there's they're much more 
there are many more of them exist than single  
raised pots so uh they account for almost as much 
easiest singular spots and then four bed pots are  
basically not as important lastly I categorized 
Eevee by position and now this isn't win rate by  
position this is the size of the Paw times the 
frequency so if you're gonna get really really  
good at one position in particular I'd recommend 
it be the big blind and this kind of makes sense  
because this is where the majority of your losses 
should come from from trying to defend your blind  
being forced to put in money and the rest of it 
just kind of follows what you might expect button  
next small blind after that and so on and so you 
can use this to get a sense of the the overall  
group stats I'll make a copy of this spreadsheet 
and put it in the description again if you want  
to play around with it please do not request 
access I'm not going to give it to you guys  
select file make a copy file make a copy don't try 
and request access thank you very much okay so to  
wrap up this way you quantify the value of spots 
is to take frequency times the pot size times some  
performance metric that tells you what you should 
practice next and the idea is very simple we're  
going to measure the performance of different 
spots and practice practice until you slowly  
improve so the very final part of this lecture 
is showing you how to practice against custom  
Solutions now we just put out a video about this 
so I'll keep it brief so you want to get started  
training next now if you just have a starter or 
premium subscription eat this spot importance  
method will still work just fine for you what 
you need to do is open up your drills page and  
go and make different drills for different spots 
uh so we have some pre-made drills here you can  
try if you don't want to set it up yourself 
but you can also customize your drills so for  
example this is a button versus cut off three bed 
pot test that I made using the dynamic algorithm  
and there's my GTA Wizard score after 50 hands 
not a fantastic score I will say that I find  
the dynamic algorithm is a little more punishing 
than the one where it just mixes every size and  
lets you get away with weird lines when you're 
simplifying to one size not quite so forgiving  
however it's very good practice but if you want 
to test something a little more broad you can do  
that as well and you can always find your detail 
Wizard score in these tables here uh just select  
your format your drill and practice it that 
way now to make your own new drill what we're  
going to do is we're going to create a new drill 
here so first of all we'll select our solution  
let me change that over to cash and so if you're 
practicing pre-made Solutions of course you just  
want to select one of these but I want to show 
you how to make custom Training Solutions so we're  
going to go ahead and set up a new solution and 
let's go and pre-fill some spots let's say it's  
going to be a hijack versus cut off three bed pot 
all right it's filled in the ranges it's filled  
in the stack and the pot size and let me go and we 
could use automatic trees that's fine if you want  
to do that I have my own Dynamic bed sizing tree 
that I want to use for these types of spots so  
let me go and find something that's good for 
three bed pot and this one will work great  
so these ones have 25 50 75 and so three batch 
sizes three raised sizes at each decision Point  
uh these are my optimized sizes for a three bed 
pot these are the sizes I choose to practice okay  
you can choose your own sizes make it as simple 
or as complicated as you want I'm gonna go ahead  
and create a new solution all right and let's go 
ahead and just give it a name so let's I'm going  
to save this I'm going to call this um what 
is this hijack versus cut off three bat parts  
okay save and you know what let's go ahead 
and just limit the session to 50 hands  
um we'll save it again hijack versus cut off three 
bad pots 50 ands sure all right and so we're gonna  
go ahead and find that drill just a sec and here's 
my new drill you can see I've given a little new  
drilled tag so I can find it easily because I have 
many different drills but from here we can just  
simply practice it we'll just hit start training 
and just like that we are diving into a practice  
session with our Dynamic sizing tree just the way 
we want it and what do you know we flop top set  
let's check to the aggressor if they lead 
out we'll go ahead and slow play this one
check they bet again oh beautiful we're 
just gonna slow play no need to rush check
all in oh wonderful wonderful and we take it down 
so some tips and tricks for practicing against  
custom Solutions uh first of all see our guide 
again if you have Elite try using Dynamic it's  
a totally different experience when it simplifies 
down to one bet size it doesn't quite let you get  
away with as much nonsense so you're kind of 
forced to learn like good lines save spots in  
advance so like I like to make different drills 
for different spots and something else you can  
try if you're lazy like me is to kind of merge the 
ranges in some spots so for example I don't want  
to practice like you know low Jack versus hijack 
and LoJack versus cut off and hijack versus cut  
off I just kind of all simplify this to early 
position versus middle position three bet pot  
and so what I do is I just kind of average the 
the ranges out a bit and that just means I have  
less things to practice and they're strategically 
similar enough that I don't care enough to learn  
the difference but if you want something more 
nuanced you do you I'm just being a little lazy  
okay guys that's my lecture now if you have any 
questions leave them down as a comment below or  
reach out to our Discord server we're always happy 
to talk theory there that's my video guys I hope  
you enjoyed it I hope you got something out of it 
thanks for watching and as always happy grinding
