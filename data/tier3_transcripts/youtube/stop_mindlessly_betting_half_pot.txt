### TOPIC: stop mindlessly betting half pot
[Music] are you someone who bets half pot all 
the time just because you're not sure what else  
to do it might seem like a safe option but in 
reality you could be leaving a ton of money  
on the table in this video we'll look at some 
spots where sizing up or down can make a big  
difference to your win rate so that you too can 
be the shark on your table [Music] [Applause]  
when it comes to over betting the number one rule 
is to only do it when villain is kept the last  
thing you want to do is to be bombing it into 
a range full of straits and flashes because not  
only do we lose a huge pot against these hands 
we also lose a lot of value against the hands  
that we beat and that's because the more that 
hands villain has the more BL catchers they can  
fold without overfolded best spots to overb are 
really those where our opponent has almost zero  
nut hands because then it also means that he has 
to pay us off with a ton of weak Bluff catchers  
as for how we can identify if our opponent's range 
is capped that really comes down to a combination  
of the action and the run out so whenever our 
opponent takes a passive action like check  
calling or checking behind it really makes it 
much less likely that he has a very strong head  
because all of his nut hands are going to want to 
be batting or raising to build the Pod so whenever  
our opponent fails to do that then it's much more 
likely that he has some kind of weak BL catcher  
that's just trying to get to show out and when you 
combine that with a blank run out meaning nothing  
really changes on the next card then that's the 
perfect situation to be over betting and putting  
a ton of pressure on our opponent's Bluff catchers 
for example on this King highboard button versus  
big blind let's imagine if we make a small CED in 
position and big blind responds by just calling  
so now we have the first criteria which is our 
opponent taking a passive action if he did have  
something like a two pair orad then these hands 
would be raising most of the time right they're  
very strong they want to be building a big pot so 
the fact that our opponent didn't raise takes away  
a lot of these hands from his range and you can 
see most of the calling range is really just weak  
BL catchers right there's a lot of stuff like 
second pair third pair has like weak top pairs  
that just want to get to show up and if we combine 
that with a blank turn so on the DU of clubs for  
example it's not a turn that really changes much 
big blind will of course hit some new strong hands  
like King du and pocket Dees but these hands are 
really not that big of a part of our opponent's  
range and even if we add them up with all of 
the previously slow played you know hands like  
King eight and 108 it still barely makes up 4% of 
the Big blind's Range so now we have both pieces  
of the puzzle passive action Plus blank run out 
and this actually makes it the perfect spot to be  
overbetting you can see the only size that Buton 
uses here is the 1.3x part overb so let's take  
a look at big blind's response in order to better 
understand why the overb is so effective here you  
can see big blind is continuing all of his top 
pair he's also calling with most of his second  
pair and there's even a little bit of ax and USX 
that's calling as well and just from this response  
alone you can already start to see we don't even 
need that strong of a hand to be overbed even if  
we have a decent top pair like king queen or King 
Jack there's still plenty of wor hands that can be  
calling us and we're also not that worried about 
running into a better hand and this is actually  
a very common mistake which is for players to go 
for a normal kind of size right with king queen  
king Jack you'll see a lot of players just go for 
a half bad or 2/3 spot size bad uh and while that  
does get us caught by more hands the problem is 
that the times you do get called by these hands  
you just win such a small partt so overall is 
actually better to size up and sort of accept the  
fact that we're going to get caught by a tighter 
range but at the same time we just generate so  
much more value from the hands that do call on 
the other hand if the flush completes on the turn  
then this is a spot where it makes a lot of sense 
to be sizing down so if we try going for the over  
bad you know with the same kind of idea in mind 
maybe we want to win a bigger bat from hands like  
top pair at the expense of folding out a little 
bit more second pair you can see the same kind of  
logic doesn't really work here simply because big 
bline doesn't even have to defend with all of his  
top pair and that's because he has an extra 9% of 
flushes to defend with so all we're doing when we  
size up is just making the big play's calling 
range really strong and in spots like these it  
becomes very important to go for a smaller size so 
if we go for a 66% % pot size sped and it you can  
see that we get called by pretty much every single 
top pair and even second pair and third pair are  
calling at a slightly higher frequency so this is 
our strategy in the nutshell you can see that on  
all of the turns that introduce new strong heads 
in our opponent's range like straight and Flash  
completing turns we want to go for the smaller 
size in order to avoid making our opponents range  
too strong and on all of the turns that don't 
change anything such as the deals through the five  
we are able to go for the overb simply because 
we're not that worried about running into a  
strong hand and therefore we can just focus on 
extracting the maximum against the hands that do  
call for our second example we have an a highboard 
utg open versus big blank call and here you can  
see that the moment utg checks behind his range 
is relatively capped it's not really checking back  
set and two pairs at any significant frequency so 
on most turns big bline actually gets to go for a  
massive size right there's over BS up to two and 
a half times apart and the reason is the same it's  
just that we're not very worried about running 
into a better hand in this case the five might  
not look like a blank because it completes a bunch 
of straights and maybe even some two pairs but the  
thing is that utg isn't really going to be raising 
hands like 56 and 78 at full frequency so these  
hands make up a really small part of his range and 
for the most part you can see his range is really  
saturated with BL catchers like top pairs as well 
as under pairs so even if we go for a really large  
size utg is still forced to call us with a lot of 
desent you can see that every single ASX has to  
call at some frequency because he simply doesn't 
have anything better to be calling with looking  
at Big blind's strategy on various SS we see a 
very familiar Trend where anytime the turn is a  
blank big blind is just going for a massive size 
so on any de 3 four 5 six big blind is going to  
have a bunch of two pack and sets and Straits and 
crucially these are hands that utg is lacking so  
again we have both pieces of the puzzle utg takes 
a passive action on the Flop turn doesn't really  
introduce any strong heads in this range and these 
are really the kinds of situations where we want  
to be sizing up and getting the maximum amount 
of value from his bluff catchers and on the other  
hand if the fluff completes on the turn then now 
we have to be a little bit more careful utg is  
going to have a bunch of suited BR ways and it's 
is going to have a bigger proportion of Str strong  
hands so if we want to Value bet something like 
aad then now it's important to go for a slightly  
smaller size in order to get called by more hands 
that we actually beat here's a question to test  
your understanding big blind checks twice on 
the board of a645 what size should utg use  
when delay c BIC take your time to think about 
it and you can resume the video when you have  
an answer so it turns out that utg actually wants 
to bet quite small here and at first this seems a  
little bit strange because big blind has checked 
not just once but twice so surely this is going  
to remove a lot of the strong strong hands from 
his range and allow utg to be sizing up but the  
thing is when we're out of position specifically 
checking doesn't actually have the effect of  
capping our range and this is because we have 
the extra option of going for the check Race So  
looking at Big blind's very strongest hands you 
can see they're all checking at some frequency  
because unlike when we're in position and closing 
the action our opponent actually has the chance  
to put in a bed himself when we check so we can 
always go a little bit more greedy check and hope  
that our opponent puts in the bat so that we can 
raise and build an even bigger pot and because utg  
has to worry about the threat of being check 
raised this actually makes him want to go for  
a much smaller size so the same formula still 
applies we always want to look out for Passive  
actions plus blank run out but in this case case 
we just have to be a little bit more aware that  
checking is considered a passive action when we're 
in position but it's not necessarily one when we  
are out of position right simply because out of 
position has the extra option of check raising his  
very strongest heads so now that we know when to 
offet let's talk about when we might want to use a  
smaller size like a third or a quarter of the pot 
typically we want to bet small when we have lots  
of marginal hands that are interested in betting 
and there can many different reasons why it could  
be important to bet them but the one that we see 
the most often is protection for example on most  
par boards the aggressor tends to go for quite a 
small C so for button versus big blank on a flop  
of 774 if you look at the composition of buttons 
range you can see that it's quite weighted towards  
marginal hands right there's a lot of hands that 
have between 60 to 70% equity and crucially these  
hands have quite a bit of incentive to be batting 
so just imagine if we have a hand like Ace King  
or Ace green and let's say we make a small bat 
of 33% part look at all of the worst Ace highs  
and King highs that we can get value from and 
at the same time we also fold out PL pants that  
have six outs against us so with Ace King if you 
make a small bed and you fold out Jack 10 and Jack  
n that's actually a pretty good result because 
you're denying your opponent his 25% equity share  
so whenever we have these two components right 
if we have some component of thin value and we  
have some component of equity denial right that's 
usually sufficient reason to be batting our head  
but of course with aing or a scen we don't really 
really want to go that large uh just imagine if  
we we were to go 75% part right now when you look 
at big blind range is going to become much tighter  
right now we're starting to lose value against 
all of these worse King highs or even ace high  
is starting to fall sometimes and while we still 
deny a fair bit of equity it's no longer enough  
to justify Bing and basically if you want to bet a 
hand like aing or if you want a b hand like Forex  
uh you're just forced to use a small size and 
that's really what's driving this 33% that size  
that we see here on the other hand if our range 
lacks marginal hands or perhaps the marginal hands  
that we do have are not very interested in beding 
then it wouldn't make sense to use a small size so  
for example imagine if we see back the same flop 
of 774 the big blank calls and now we get an ace  
on the turn right this is actually a spot where 
the solver mostly goes for the overb so looking  
at the equity buckets over here you can actually 
see we are missing the bucket of 60 to 70% Equity  
hands and that's because uh in this kind of 
situation if you have an ace or better then  
you're going to have more than 70% equity and on 
the other hand if you don't have an A so let's say  
if we have kings queens and Jacks then these send 
only have 50 something per Equity so this creates  
a situation where anything that is not an ace so 
Kings s and Jacks they're just not strong enough  
to be value betting and anything Ace X or better 
so if you have Ace King or if you have a hand like  
trips uh these hands are allowed to be going for a 
very big size right so there's not a lot of hands  
that make sense to be Bing small and while you 
can consider a hand like weak ASX a marginal hand  
right so hands like ace5 A6 if we did want to bet 
these hands right maybe we would see more small  
bets but the problem is that even these hands 
don't gain that much from Equity denial so imagine  
if we make a small bat with a hand like A6 and now 
if you look at the hands that are folding right  
we just don't need to be fold holding out any of 
these hands right they're pretty much drawing de  
against us so while we have quite decent Equity 
when call right the lack of equity denial just  
makes it much better to be playing these hands 
as a check and once again if we're checking hands  
like ace5 and A6 then there is really no reason to 
be using such a small size here's another question  
to think about pick BL three bet versus cut off 
on a flop of 774 what size should big blind C bet  
a should we go for a 33% po size bed or B should 
we go for a 3/4 po size bed and don't forget to  
think about what our marginal hands want to be 
doing so if you guessed B then that is absolutely  
correct it might seem a little bit strange to be 
betting so big on such a dry board but at the end  
of the day if we don't have any marginal hands 
that we're interested in betting then there is  
simply no reason to be sizing down so looking 
at the composition of Big blind's Range you  
can actually see that big blind doesn't have any 
hands in the region of 60 to 70% acity and that's  
because if you think about the kind of range that 
he's three betting we're either three betting some  
kind of big overpar we even have a bunch of 78 
and 67 that has hit trips and all of these hands  
are strong enough to go for a large size so it's 
not like the previous example where it was Buton  
versus pick planine in the single race pod but's 
going to have left hands like Forex right hands  
like small pocket pairs that want to bet for 
protection and big blade doesn't really have  
that many of these s and because of that it really 
makes more sense to be using a slightly larger  
size that is consistent with how polarized our 
ranges another key difference has to do with how  
much Equity a hand like Ace kinging has previously 
in the single race pod Ace King was quite clearly  
a magal h we were able to make a small bad get 
plenty of D value and deny a bunch of equity at  
the same time right but here in the three bet part 
cut off range is much stronger after calling our  
three bad and you can see this reflected in the 
equity of our hand as well Ace King only has 53%  
Equity so it's not really able to make the same 
kind of small bad and get caught by that many wor  
heads most of the stuff that c either beats us or 
has a lot of equity against us and it's not like  
in a single race spot where our opponent has a ton 
of ASX offsuit that we can get plenty of th value  
from and as a result Ace King is really betting 
as a bluff on the Flop instead of trying to go  
for a small bat it's it makes a lot more sense 
to size up hopefully fold out some pocket pairs  
or if not on the Flop then on a later street but 
at the end of the day Bluffs are really not that  
particular about beted sizing right they're really 
just there to make sure that our value hands get  
paid and in this case if our value region wants 
to go for a large size then that's what aing and  
all of our other Bluffs are going to do as
