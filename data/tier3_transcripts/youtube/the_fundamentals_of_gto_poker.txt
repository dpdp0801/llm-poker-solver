### TOPIC: the fundamentals of gto poker
if you're intrigued by poker you probably 
come across this term GTO a game theory  
optimal strategy touted as the ultimate unbeatable 
playing style but what exactly is a GTO strategy  
in poker what does that actually mean and how 
are these strategies generated what makes them  
unexploitable what makes them so good do they work 
against opponents that aren't also playing GTO and  
how does GTO actually generate money in poker 
we'll cover all this and More in today's video
first of all what is a game theory optimal 
strategy GTO is defined as being unexploitable  
meaning your opponents can take advantage of 
any mistakes that you're making it's defined  
as the best possible strategy against the perfect 
opponent so if you can imagine that you're playing  
against someone who knows how you play your 
range in every spots on every board and will  
perfectly adapt to counter any of your mistakes 
the best possible strategy against that player is  
GTO it's defined as being in a Nash equilibrium 
a state of balance and we'll talk about that in  
just a minute at its core GTO is a defensive 
strategy designed to minimize your leaks it's  
the most robust playing style as it can perform 
well against Maniacs nits calling stations you  
name it the goal of any poker strategy is the same 
maximize your profit GTO is just a scientific way  
to achieve that to understand GTO we must first 
understand the concept of Nash equilibrium this  
is a state where no player can do better by 
unilaterally changing their strategy let that  
definition sink in for a moment what this means 
is that if you're playing against GTO players you  
have no incentive to play anything but GTO and 
if everybody is playing GTO well no one has any  
incentive to change what they're doing they've 
already made as much money as they can in the  
spot and any change to their strategy would 
be detrimental this is where the term balance  
comes from and this is why GTO is such a powerful 
strategy that's all good and well but how exactly  
are GTO strategies generated well we use software 
called solvers and solvers are basically just EV  
maximizing algorithms that is to say given a set 
of strategies it can calculate how much money each  
strategy will make it knows how much money every 
hand will make in every spot at every decision  
point so given all this information here's our 
recipe to achieve GTO first of all we're going  
to start with two players player a and player 
B initially using completely random strategies  
then we're going to fix player A's strategy by 
fix I mean lock it in place prevent player a  
from changing and then we're going to let player 
B exploit them or find a higher EV strategy next  
we're going to fix player B's new strategy and let 
player a exploit them and then we're going to fix  
player A's new strategy and let player B exploit 
them we go back and forth and back and forth  
iterating thousands of times until neither player 
can do any better we repeat this process until we  
achieve Nash equilibrium this is something of an 
oversimplification there are other implementations  
or recipes if you will to achieve GTO but all of 
them involve pitting eveve maximizing algorithms  
against each other until no one can improve 
further this process of repeated exploitation  
is what makes GTO unexploitable at some point 
neither player can improve their strategy and  
that point is Nash equilibrium and so this goes to 
show that the most exploitative strategy against  
GTO is GTO throughout this video we've been using 
terms like equilibrium and exploitative but before  
we go further we really need to break down what 
that means an equilibrium strategy is at its  
heart defensive it's the optimal strategy without 
information on your opponents and defined as a  
Nash equilibrium balance strategy that minimizes 
the risk of exploitation an exploitative strategy  
on the other hand is offensive it's the optimal 
strategy with information about your how your  
opponents play and it is imbalanced this type 
of strategy can maximize profit by capitalizing  
on your opponent's mistakes but it carries a risk 
of counter exploitation meaning it might backfire  
now that you understand how GTO works we need to 
address one of the most common myths surrounding  
this topic does it work against non- GTO opponents 
this is a very important question because all  
of your opponents are imbalanced no human can 
actually play Perfect GTO so this needs to be  
able to actually make money against imbalanced 
opposition recall the definition of Nash  
equilibrium a state where no player can do better 
by unilaterally changing their strategy if you're  
playing GTO your opponent's best response their 
optimal counter their maximum EV strategy against  
what you're doing is to play GTO themselves but 
since they're not doing that they're imbalanced  
they're leaving money on the table therefore 
by the very definition of Nash equilibrium a  
GTO strategy will always outperform an imbalanced 
strategy in the long run heads up to really drive  
this point home let's take a look at a heads up 
cach game you will open 2.5x in position here's  
Big blind's GTO response all of these hands in 
red are supposed to be three betting raising to  
10 big blinds but let's imagine for a moment that 
the big blind is some massive knit and they only  
ever raise Ace Ace now this is obviously not a 
great strategy but let's imagine that you in the  
small blind don't adapt you are just playing a 
fixed GTO strategy you're going to respond as  
if they were raising all of those hands they were 
in the last thing and you're going to play Future  
streets as if they were had a GTO range you may 
be tempted to think to yourself that hey wait a  
second aren't we going to get destroyed as the 
small blind GTO player here aren't we just going  
to get completely value owned and I would say you 
need to reverse your perspective to understand  
why this is not the case here I've taken a look at 
the strategy plus EV of the original GTO strategy  
let's examine ASAS by raising to 10 it makes 12.9 
big blinds that's the value of three betting this  
hand now question to you does ASAS make more money 
if it's the only hand that's three [Music] betting  
the answer is no it makes exactly the same amount 
of money because you haven't changed your strategy  
think about it this is how much money you can make 
against GTO you're still playing GTO so it can't  
make more money against you right even if it's the 
only hand in range it's still making exactly the  
same amount that's the best it can do what about 
all of these other hands what about King King well  
king king would have made way more money three 
betting than calling but in our hypothetical it's  
calling it's leaving money on the table losing 
about four big blinds what about Ace King suited  
again leaving money on the table this hand would 
much rather three bet than call in fact we can use  
the compare EV function to get a nice graphic here 
I'm going to compare the expected value of call in  
against raising and filter for the raised hands 
everything in red here would rather three bet  
than call you can see the call loses money hence 
these hands are red meaning that these hands would  
rather raise so Queens for example would make 
8.32 big blinds with ar raise 5.52 as a call  
in summary what this means is that ASAS is making 
exactly the same amount of money no more despite  
the fact that you're just treating it like a GTO 
player you're not adapting and every one of these  
other hands in red is losing money because they're 
calling instead of three betting so going back to  
this that's why this strategy is obviously not 
crushing GTO in fact it's losing a huge amount  
of money even against the player that's blindly 
playing GTO now we can imagine that if small  
blind is sharp they'll notice that big blind 
is a complete nit and they can further adjust  
their strategy by obviously folding to arrays 
and this in turn has the effect of decreasing  
the expected value of Asa significantly further 
lowering big Line's value obviously this is not a  
good strategy and this is why you shouldn't be 
afraid of things like oh my opponent is doing  
this and that there is a minimum EV guarantee in 
place that said against an imbalanced opponent the  
optimal strategy with that information is to play 
exploitatively to take on some risk in order to  
punish their mistakes however this always carries 
some risk it might backfire you need to know what  
they're doing and you need to know how to adjust 
to exploit that and if you're wrong if they  
counter you either accidentally or intentionally 
you will lose more money than you stood to gain  
with the initial exploit that said the counter 
exploit always gains exponentially more than the  
initial exploit speaking as a poker coach a lot 
of players who tout themselves as exploitative  
players realistically they only look at I think 
my opponent's too value heavy or not value heavy  
enough true exploitative analysis is far more 
complex than studying GTO by like an order of  
magnitude it involves heavy use of Statistics 
it involves Mass data analysis node locking  
plugging this in into solvers setting incentives 
there's a whole science to it that I'm not going  
to cover in this video but take it from me that 
true exploitative analysis goes very deep and  
most people haven't even scratched the surface 
this is where the draw of a balanc strategy  
comes into play you don't need any reads with a 
Balan GTO strategy you just need to try and play  
approximate GTL and this carries a certain minimum 
guarantee that is to say regardless of how your  
opponents are playing you're guaranteed to make 
at least this much if not more let's talk a bit  
more about this minimum EV guarantee one of the 
most alluring aspects of playing a GTO strategy  
is that it guarantees a certain minimum expected 
value what this means is that if you're playing  
GTO you'll win at least this much money or more in 
the long run the best your opponents can do is to  
play GTO themselves and give you your minimum EV 
but if they're not playing GTO and recall no one  
actually is then they're making mistakes and your 
expected value increases this is the Allure of  
playing a GTO strategy however there is a caveat 
to this this specifically applies to heads up  
pots in Zero Sum games this guarantee does not 
exist in multi-way pots in fact no strategy is  
unexploitable in a multi-way pot because two 
or more people can simultaneously change their  
strategy finally let's discuss how GTO actually 
generates profit this was a subject that was  
filled with misconceptions up until previous years 
and I think it's only recently that people have  
started to truly understand this topic you see 
there are two types of mistakes in poker mixing  
mistakes and pure mistakes a mixing mistake means 
that you're taking the appropriate actions but  
you're not doing it with the correct frequencies 
for example if a GTO strategy says you should call  
half the time fold half the time but you're always 
folding that's a mixing mistake conversely a pure  
mistake is one that you should not be taking 
at any frequency so if the GTO strategy says  
you should always call this hand but you're always 
folding well now you're actually losing EV take a  
look at this spot we're in the big blind facing a 
third pot CED from the small blind board is Queen  
Jack 5 and we have a gutshot now you can see that 
the GTO strategy here wants to call 97% of the  
time and we can see that it's plus EV this gains 
0.34 big blinds or 34 big blinds per 100 if we  
were to fold this hand in this spot we're leaving 
34 big blinds per 100 on the table this is where  
the GTO strategy makes money when the opponents 
fold hands like 98 here and make a pure mistake  
however we can also see that raising seven or 
raising 12 turning this hand into a bluff is  
playable at a low frequency about 3% of the time 
the GTO strategy wants to raise this hand and this  
makes about as much money as calling would however 
if you were to always raise this hand then your  
rays might be too bluffy and that is exploitable 
now the GTO strategy won't necessarily make money  
against that however an Adaptive opponent might 
notice that your bluff raising too much and adjust  
their strategy to exploit you in summary a mixing 
mistake involves using the incorrect frequencies  
GTO does not gain against mixing mistakes and 
a mixing mistake will only lose value if the  
opponent exploits it conversely a pure mistake 
means the take an action that strictly loses EV  
against your opponent's strategy GTO gains versus 
p mistakes so the answer to how GTO makes money  
is that the GTO player gains any time the opponent 
makes a pure mistake Game Theory optimal poker is
