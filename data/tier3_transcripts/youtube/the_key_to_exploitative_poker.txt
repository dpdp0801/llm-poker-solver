### TOPIC: the key to exploitative poker
hey guys tombos 21 here and in today's video I'm 
going to teach you the foundations of exploitative  
Poker we'll start with the GTO versus exploit 
comparison then I'm going to teach you the  
five fundamental imbalances and how to exploit 
each one of them we'll back each one of these  
up with practical examples from GTO Wizards no 
locking tool hey everyone before we start the  
video we'd really appreciate it if you could hit 
the like And subscribe buttons your support means  
a lot to us let's talk about balanced versus 
exploitative poker a balanced style of Poker  
is a defensive strategy it seeks to minimize your 
own leaks and it doesn't adapt to the opposition  
this style when implemented correctly carries no 
risk of counter exploitation and is the strongest  
fixed strategy you can play it doesn't require 
any reads however the downside is it doesn't  
necessarily maximize win rate because it doesn't 
seek to take advantage of your opponent's mistakes  
that's where exploitative poker comes in now an 
exploitative style is offensive it seeks to attack  
your opponent's leaks and it adapts the different 
types of opponents however any exploit carries  
some risk of counter exploitation and to do this 
properly you require reads so you need to have  
some insights into your opponent strategy this 
style when done correctly can maximize your win  
rate many players will argue that you're either 
one or the other you're either a GTO player or  
you're an exploitative player but this couldn't 
be further from the truth the best players in the  
world use a hybrid approach and furthermore you 
can't understand one style without understanding  
the other for example GTO is informed by the 
potential exploits of the position whereas EXP  
exploitative poker uses GTO as a baseline if 
you're looking at some solver output some Sim  
how are you going to understand why it is the 
way it is without also understanding that the  
opponent could exploit them in this or that way 
if they didn't use this strategy and conversely  
how are you going to play exploitative poker if 
you don't know how to use GTO as a baseline how  
can you say that they're bluffing too much if 
you don't know what the right amount of Bluffin  
is in the first place right you need one for the 
other in fact this is actually how solvers work  
to generate a Nash equilibrium solution you take 
take two exploitative Bots have them play each  
other until neither can exploit further and that's 
equilibrium that's GTO there are two categories  
of exploits proactive and reactive a proactive 
exploit involves adjusting your strategy before  
they've deviated so anticipating their mistake 
whereas a reactive exploit involves adjusting  
your strategy after they've made their move if 
you watched our previous video donker Leon calls  
this the setup and punish before you can start 
implementing these tactical exploits you first  
need to learn to recognize imbalances an imbalance 
is a way some strategy can be different from GTO  
the problem is there's an infinite number of 
strategies so we need to break this down into  
different categories I call these the five 
fundamental imbalances the first one is Bing  
volume which asks what lines they're putting in 
the most money did they put a lot of money into  
the betting line or the checking line for example 
the next is equity management which asks how they  
appraise their hand classes and how they allocate 
their value and nutted hands are they putting lots  
of nuts into this line but not that line well 
that's a useful piece of information the next  
is polarity or more generally range morphology 
so this asks is their range representing nuts  
and Bluffs or is their range more middling 
strength hands then we have elasticity which  
asks how sensitive their responses to pricing 
will they react the same way to a small bet as  
they would a medium bet well that's another 
crucial piece of information finally there's  
board coverage board coverage generally asks 
how well they can represent hand classes on  
different types of runouts and in particular 
we're interested in knowing if certain lines  
are over or under saturated with certain hand 
classes these imbalances create incentives for  
you to take on some risk in order to capitalize on 
your opponent's mistakes and exploitative poker is  
all about studying incentives in the following 
examples I want you to keep in mind that I'm  
not prescribing a strategy I'm not saying you 
ought to be playing this or that way I'm merely  
demonstrating how these imbalances incentivize 
your exploits something else to keep in mind  
and we'll see this in some following examples is 
that solvers will actively try to thwart your node  
locks you must keep in mind when studying with 
solvers that they are just e maximizing algorithms  
so if you force one player to play a hugely binus 
eeve strategy it probably tries to redirect those  
hands into other lines in order to minimize 
the damage I'm going to show you a few tips  
and tricks for studying with no loocks and how 
we can prevent it from ruining our experiments in  
this video we'll break down the five fundamental 
imbalances and we'll show you how to attack them  
using GTO wizard node locking let's start with 
betting volume recall betting volume asks what  
lines your opponent is putting in the most money 
that's where you'll want to put your value hands  
they could be putting in money through bets or 
raises or through calls now imagine that your  
opponent bets a lot when you check to them that's 
going to give you an incentive to put your nutted  
hands into the checking line because that's how 
they'll make more money conversely imagine your  
opponent raises a lot when you bet that's going to 
give you incentive to put your nutted hands into  
the betting line because they'll expect to face 
more raises and therefore make more money so it  
all comes down to the idea of just imagine you had 
the nuts what line makes the most money generally  
speaking your nutted hands dictates your strategy 
and the rest of your hands follow along so let  
me dive into an example for my first example 
I've chosen a blind versus blind single race  
pod ranges are taken from a cash game however 
these fundamental exploits will apply to all  
formats let's run an experiment here we can see 
the original strategies when we check big blind  
is supposed to check back off often but sometimes 
they hit us with this really big pot siiz bet I  
want to make them more aggressive when we check 
so instead of 26% of the time we're going to make  
them bet 40% of the time we'll lock solve and here 
we can see now they're being more aggressive how  
should small blind adapt knowing that big blind 
is too aggressive in the checking line so how  
should we react or proactively adjust small blinds 
range well unsurprisingly it is now checking 100%  
of hands and the reason for this is quite simple 
if we go back to the GTO solution for a second
here take a look at the expected value of 
something nutted for example uh let's take  
a look at T you'll notice that the EV of betting 
and checking is quite similar in fact it's almost  
equal and this will be the case for the vast 
majority of nutted hands in our range if we  
compare the expected value between betting 
and checking we can see that most of these  
hands are in white okay but this is predicated 
on a certain assumption this is predicated on  
the assumption that your hands are going to 
see the same amount of money going to the pot  
in both the checking and the betting lines so 
we expect that tens will make the same amount  
of money in both lines however when we made big 
blind more aggressive we increased the amount  
of money that went into the pot in the checking 
line and therefore all of your nutted hands have  
now have more incentive to go into this line and 
because all our nutted hands want to go into the  
checking line the rest of the hands followed along 
because all the silver doesn't want to put a bunch  
of mediocre hands into one line and all the nuts 
into another because that's too exploitable going  
back to the node lock here we can see that if 
we change this to compare EV and we compare for  
example the expected value of checking against 
Bing and just filter for the top of our range  
you'll see that all of a sudden our value hands 
are lit up in green indicate that checking is now  
higher EV than Bing let's try another experiment 
let's imagine that big blind is Raising too often  
against our lead so they're supposed to raise 
133% of the time we'll put that up to 20% and  
lock that in place how should small blind adjust 
well logically would think that they should be  
betting more with their value hands right because 
they'll make more money that way let's take a look  
if we compare this to the GTO strategy we'll see 
that we're actually checking a lot more overall  
you can see GTO was actually more aggressive 
than our nod log strategy what's going on here  
and similarly even our value hands are checking 
more often and this is an important lesson when  
it comes to working with solvers you see solvers 
are eveve maximizing algorithms and they're going  
to do everything they can to minimize the damage 
for whatever crazy strategy you forc them to take  
so what's happening here is that when we check big 
blind has actually increased their Bing volume in  
this line in order to balance it out so we firstly 
increased the expected value of the Bing line so  
we increased how much money is going in here and 
then to compensate big blind is now increasing the  
Bing volume in the checking line if we compare to 
the GTL solution we can see that big blind is now  
more aggressive than they were before putting in 
quite a bit more Bing volume now and they've done  
this to compensate for the fact that the 25% 
Line is now a line where they have to put in  
too much money so they're trying to balance it in 
both cases okay so let's repeat this experiment  
one last time and this time we're going to force 
big blind to check a GTO range okay so it's the  
exact same setup but this time I forced them to 
behave the exact same way as GTO in the checking  
line so they can't balance out their Bing volume 
and I still force them to raise more often in the  
Bing line going back here we can see that small 
blind strategy has adjusted and in particular  
it's become a lot more linear you can see with 
over pairis plus we are very rarely slow playing  
compare that to the GTO solution here we can see 
we're betting less often but hands like Straits  
sets two pair over pair top pair all of these 
hands are betting more often in the node locked  
solution because they expect to make more money 
in that line and and so this is the key concept  
of betting volume your nutted hands will want 
to follow the line that makes the most money  
obviously right and the rest of your hands tend 
to follow along well there are some complications  
for example this we saw earlier with the silver 
adjusting its strategy and trying to balance its  
beding volume overall the heris stic will always 
apply it should be noted that bedding volume is  
not restricted to one streets in reality opponents 
might be putting in more volume on later streets  
and that can change the equation but you need to 
understand this fun fundamental thing in order  
to begin your exploits the next fundamental 
imbalance comes down to how they manage their  
Equity there are two parts to this there's nut 
allocation which asks where are they putting  
their strongest hands are they putting a lot of 
value into this line or that line and then hand  
appraisal so how much do they value different 
types of hand classes how much money are they  
willing to put in with this type of hand or that 
type of hand so let me show you some examples of  
how you can use this concept to exploit in poker 
for this next example I've chosen a button versus  
big blind single Ray pot flop is a63 we bet small 
get called Turn is the six of Spades pairing the  
middle card so surprisingly button prefers this 
massive 200% overb here with like a thin part  
of its range you can see with this overb they're 
representing things like boats trips very strong  
top pair and about 56% of the range are bluffs 
okay so here's a question for you do you believe  
that your opponents when they over bet twice the 
pot are bluffing more than half the time maybe not  
okay well let's see what happens if that's the 
case let's no lock this and I'm going to start  
by locking everything in place and I'm going to 
adjust the strategy so first of all we're going  
to make all of these nutted hands so trips plus 
are all going to Pure a bit and let's go ahead  
and adjust the trash hand so I will use this 
little filter thing here and we'll just make  
them check more of these Bluffs so now they're 
under bluffing and Valu betting too much so we've  
created a value IM balance now the exploit against 
this is very very obvious obviously we're going to
overfolded 92% of our range let's compare that 
to the GTO strategy here we can see the original  
GTO strategy was calling about a third of the 
time the new strategy is only calling about 7%  
of the time so as you can see the adjustment is 
pretty obvious the main thing being that hands  
like top pair under pairs all of these marginal 
Bluff catchers are no longer good calls because  
they're not going to be checking back the river 
often enough their range is too value heavy so a  
lot of these mediocre Bluff catchers that rely on 
your opponent betting turn giving up River they're  
just no longer going to make enough money that 
one's pretty obvious something else to keep in  
mind is that button has checked or has capped 
their checking range so their checking range  
no longer contains any of these strongest hands 
and therefore so just as an example none of these  
hands are checking anymore so they can't represent 
trips full houses quads on any River so obviously  
you can attack them pretty aggressively on a lot 
of different Rivers yeah I'll just choose like a  
seven of clubs for example you can see it absurd 
like 1,000% overb just 10x all in and this is just  
coming from the fact that buttons range is going 
to be too capped in a lot of these lines all right  
so let's do the opposite test this time let's 
make them to Bluff heavy so I'm going to revert  
to the GTO strategy and again we'll start here 
we're going to nod loock this except this time  
we're going to have them Bluff more often with air 
so again we'll lock everything in place and we'll  
just have them Bluff let's say some flush draws 
and just some random weak air okay so now we've  
created a bluffing imbalance they're bluffing 
too often way too often so how do we handle a  
situation like this well they put in a lot of 
money with a very polarized range and as you  
can see the silver just doesn't fold a lot right 
the problem is that button is simply representing  
too much air so what's going to happen is the 
button simply going to have to uh just check  
back the river a ton so for example if I choose 
like a two of Hearts here we could probably bet  
pretty aggressively but even if we check on some 
lines uh basically they're just going to have to  
check behind a lot of the time as you can see 
like it looks like a lot of red here but keep  
in mind these offit combos count for a lot 
of weight and so they just end up checking  
behind with complete garbage you can see it's 
just pure air so often that basically anything  
with Showdown value in our range is going to 
be a fine call even King High which is absurd  
I mean maybe don't actually do that but as you 
can see the silver gets pretty out of line if  
you're too Bluff heavy or too value heavy so this 
time what I want to do is Model A play player who  
isn't going to be able to find the fold with 
hands like top hair or like a nut flush draw  
here so put in this bet and we'll node lock them 
and this time instead of locking everything uh I'm  
just going to use what's called combo locking so 
I'm only going to lock for example just this one  
hand class top pair here and the rest of their 
range can adjust let's see what happens so we're  
modeling a player that overvalues top pair and 
is willing to call even like a 2X pot bed here  
let's compare what has happened so first of all 
notice something interesting is that their actual  
their calling volume hasn't changed at all they're 
calling exactly the same frequency although with  
different hands and this is kind of odd but if 
you take a look what's happening is that they're  
compensating by folding more draws they are now 
folding more often with flush draws as you can  
see here and that helps them compensate for the 
fact that they now have to call more often with  
their top pair so let's go ahead and lock the 
flush draws in place as well all of their flush  
draws must call and again what we can see here is 
that the calling frequency still hasn't changed  
but something else has so let me go back to hands 
and compare against the GTO solution okay so the  
overall strategy hasn't really changed only 
calling like 1% more it's not really a real  
difference here right so what's happening how are 
we able to lock these calls in place and yet they  
aren't calling more often well what's happened is 
another lesson in node locking a solver will do  
whatever it can to minimize the damage of whatever 
absurd strategy you force to to play and in this  
case it's found that donking is now a much better 
strategy because now it doesn't have to put its  
top pair into this really ugly line you forced it 
to play so now we'll find that most of the flush  
draws as well as the top pair are now going into 
a doning line we don't want that so what we'll do  
is again just force them to check this is what 
they were doing in equilibrium they were just  
checking on the turn always again we're going to 
force them to check in now our experiment should  
work a good tip to keep in mind is to always 
lock the root nodes otherwise the solver May  
proactively adjust in order to to thwart whatever 
you're trying to do okay here we put in this big  
size now we can see that they're calling let's say 
45% of the time so now they are calling more often  
again comparing this to GTO we can see now their 
calling frequency has realistically increased  
quite a bit so how should button proactively 
adjust their rate knowing big blind is kind of  
a station well exploit should be obvious to most 
strong players it's the BET more value heavy bet  
a lot more linearly so let's compare sizing hasn't 
changed we're betting a little bit less often you  
can see from 22 to 19 but what's mainly happened 
we are now betting more often with our best hands  
so you can see in the GTO solution we are only 
betting 35% of the time with our best hands and  
now we're betting 52% of the time and and the 
other thing is that we're bluffing less often  
so you can see weak hands and trash bluffing 
less often bluffing less often so it's it's  
pretty straightforward if your opponent is calling 
too much your Bluffs aren't going to make enough  
money so you Bluff less often and your value hands 
are going to make more money so you value bet more  
often right pretty straightforward stuff the 
next fundamental imbalance is polarity polarity  
asks about your opponent's range construction are 
they representing nuts and Bluffs well that's a  
very polarized range or are they representing a 
merged range with lots of medium strength hands  
and draws and such depending on how the range is 
constructed you'll want to alter your strategy how  
polarized is their range on the one hand consider 
the case where they are completely unpolarized or  
also known as condensed a condensed range is 
one that's representing medium strength hands  
without strong or weak hands in this case you 
are the polarized player with Bluffs and nuts  
and you want to be attacking that condensed 
range with big sizes and the reason is that  
that's how you get the most money from the top of 
your range and also put the most pressure on your  
opponent so if your opponent can't represent 
or counter your aggression with nutted hands  
well you want to be betting big and playing for 
Stacks now conversely you want to attack polarized  
ranges with small sizes and the reason is that 
a polarized range struggles to call so imagine  
that your opponent is representing lots of strong 
hands and lots of like really weak Bluffs they're  
going to have a very hard time facing a Min click 
or a small bet and the reason is that their value  
hands want to get more money in and their Bluffs 
cannot afford to call so their only choice is to
overfolded their Equity into their calling 
line or slow playay value that doesn't want  
to slow play again attack condensed ranges with 
big sizes attack polar ranges with small sizes  
now a caveat to this is that if their range is 
perfectly polarized you don't want to attack so  
if they're only representing the stone gold nuts 
and a pure Bluff obviously you have no incentive  
to bet into that however in most cases they'll 
they're representing a range of value hands and  
a range of Bluffs and some stuff in between so 
most of the time they're not perfectly polar and  
opportunities do arise where you want to actually 
attack these ranges in some cases if there's a  
value imbalance you might even want to overfall 
drastically depending on how much nutted hands  
they're putting in there or overall drastically 
so there are Concepts such as leverage and value  
imbalances you can view our previous YouTube 
video on Leverage Leverage is this concept  
that polarized range can bet multiple streets and 
it realizes a lot more Equity than you think it  
does so for example on the Flop if they have just 
nuts and Bluffs that player can bet like one3 nuts  
two3 Bluffs and that's a perfectly balanced range 
because they have the ability to bet again on turn  
and River so watch out for leverage because if 
your opponent is too polar they might be putting  
you in a very bad reverse impli OD situation and 
you need to know how to get out of that value  
balances is another thing so for example say your 
opponent is betting huge on the river but they've  
taken a line that represents almost exclusively 
like medium strength value uh and their huge line  
stops making sense in this case they might be 
putting too many Bluffs into that line but not  
enough nutted hands because it doesn't make sense 
for the type of value they're representing we're  
going to go through some examples here of how you 
can respond to different levels of polarity and  
some common mistakes players make and how you can 
exploit that so this next example should be pretty  
obvious to most players but it concerns attacking 
condensed ranges here we have an under the gun  
versus big blind sing R pot it is 10962 tone and 
under the gun is supposed to check back a decent  
number of for example over pairs top pairs uh 
second pairs so there's a lot of hands here  
that should check pack despite this being kind of 
a scary board right so let's node loock this and  
I'm going to go ahead and set the strategy we'll 
make it so that all of their top pair plus must  
bet so what we're going to do here essentially 
is Cap their checking range now I've left the  
other hands open so they can adjust the amount of 
Bluffs in the betting range to make it somewhat  
balanced but they're not going to be able to check 
back with a hand like top pair or better I think  
a lot of players wouldn't here they would be just 
bet all of these hands right so what happens when  
they now check well their checking range is very 
condensed right second pair third pair low pairs  
lots of pairs in ace high and they've had to 
bet quite a bit wider now too to compensate  
for the fact that they put all their value into 
their betting line unfortunately for them what  
this means is that when they check and take some 
bricks well I guess Queen isn't really a brick  
but on most turn cards under the gun is going to 
struggle in their checkback line and the reason  
is that they've capped their checking range right 
and so now we can attack this quite aggressively  
42% of the time if we compare that to the GTO 
solution here you can see that originally we were  
betting like only 88.5% of our range and now we're 
betting 44% of the time and and if we choose like  
a different turn card for example let's say like 
a two of clubs or something we're going to see  
that it's able to bet very aggressively because 
this doesn't Trump the top pair yeah so now 280%  
with 2/3 of our range so very very aggressively 
attacking under the gun here uh we we could even  
say that the queen was actually kind of a godsent 
for under the gun because it devalued Big blind's  
Top pair but here top pair is effectively the nuts 
right so 10x is ahead of basically 100% of under  
the gun range because utg didn't trap enough and 
so big blind can now attack super aggressively  
and put them in a really bad spot this is the 
basic concept if your opponent is capping their  
range they're too condensed you generally want 
to attack with really big sizes and aggressive  
strategies all right let me show you how to attack 
ranges that are too polarized so this is a button  
versus big blind single race Po and jackjack 5 is 
a beautiful board for the button because they can  
range bets super wide and they do so here action 
on big blind and big blind is supposed to counter  
this with a very aggressive check raising strategy 
most players know this but what they usually mess  
up are all of these medium strength hands sixes 
sevens eights second pair third pair they're not  
finding the check raises with these weird mergy 
hands because it's difficult to play right it  
feels like you're playing like over playing your 
hand but this is just the right counter to a range  
ped so let's see what happens if we force big 
blind to check raise a more polarized strategy  
and the way I'm going to accomplish this is by 
forcing these medium strength hands to check I  
think that or to call rather I think that's a very 
natural strategy I'm going to leave the rest of  
it unlocked so it can adjust its value and Bluff 
thresholds in order to stay relatively balanced  
but we're forcing it to play too polarized all 
right so here we raise and you can see they're  
raising less often that's one of the consequences 
of this super polarized range construction it's  
not very efficient so you don't get to raise as 
often okay they raise but button calls and let's  
take a flop something like the Ace of clubs we 
already know that they're not calling ace high  
so they can't represent top pair but they can 
still represent trips plus right and they're  
still using a big size the way you exploit this is 
often when they check the reason is that it's very  
very difficult for them to defend their checking 
range so here you can see that it's chosen a 42%  
size but that's because that's the smallest size 
I gave it on the turn so what happens if we give  
it for example a bunch of different sizes 10 20 
5 50 75 100 150 so a whole bunch of different  
sizes here uh now if you recall earlier I told you 
that you attack polarized ranges with small bets  
and that's what we'll see here the silver when 
given the option will prefer a very small bet  
size against this checking range you can see it 
prefers this 10% pot size just a we little stab  
right the reason is that their checking range 
is way too polar right they don't have very  
many natural like checking hands right so their 
checking range is like a few like super nutted  
traps and like at best King High right mostly just 
trash so when they check they're too polarized but  
we still have some incentive to fold out their 
Bluffs so we want to pick a size that is really  
hard for them to deal with and that's 10% here 
and again these ranges that are too polarized  
are usually going to end up vulnerable against 
these really small sizes Min clicks small bets  
and such you can see here that they have to fold 
67% of their range to a 10% bet which is just  
embarrassing you don't want this to happen to you 
so this is the main problem with ranges that are  
too polar they're very hard to uh play properly 
on later streets this is another common example  
of like really common exploits you can find in 
game so this is a button versus big blind spot  
and it's just been check down all the way to 
the river in this spot button is supposed to  
find a nice thin value bet with hands like under 
pairs to the ace 10x Etc so what happens in Game  
is people might take really polarizing sizings 
with and not find the thin value that's supposed  
to accompany that so even though 71% is a fine 
sizing here it can be difficult to find some  
of these thin value bets so let's go ahead and 
just lock this in place so what I'm going to do  
is set the strategy and just force these King 10 
Queen 10 typ pans to Chuck behind we'll say that  
they still find the Bluffs with the other hands 
right so we'll lock that all in place and we'll  
see what happens so they put in this bet it's too 
polar and they're under bluffing and as you can  
see we just call super white anything that can 
even remotely be considered a bluff catcher is  
now a call and the reason is simply that they're 
over bluffing and even if we have you know we can  
see we only have like 34% Equity but that's 
enough against this size it's it's more than  
enough so even though we're still losing with 
a lot of these Bluff catch because they're not  
bluffing enough because they couldn't find those 
thin value bets well these now become reasonable  
calls next I'd like to demonstrate the concept of 
Leverage I've chosen a queen queen 5 flop cut off  
versus big blind this is a pretty easy range bet 
for a small size I don't think most players will  
mess that up but let's run a little experiment 
in the name of science I'm going to give them  
this really awkward potsize bet two things to note 
about this uh three things first of all we're now  
checking a ton uh because is we're putting way 
too much bodyone in this is a very inefficient  
bet size because it donates too much to big 
blinds trips and overpays for the bluff to get  
them to fold nine high so just not a great size 
for this type of board something to note here is  
that we're putting a bunch of these under pairs 
into this bsize bed and again this is to make  
them more merged less polarized to decrease how 
exploitable you'll be against like Min clicks and  
small bets on later streets so basically we have 
some calling range for not just pure air and pure  
nuts let's run an experiment if we bed pot we're 
laying pot odds of 33% right 2 to one now if this  
were on a river all that means is that we need 
to use two value bets to every Bluff so surely  
the same logic works in the Flop right let's 
create a perfectly polarized strategy first of  
all we'll make them check everything lock that in 
place next up we will make them always bet their  
trips boats and quads okay so that accounts for 
13% of their range here next we're going to make  
them bet all of these trash hands and you can see 
this is 8 % 8.3% of the range so overall they are  
now bluffing a little more than a third of the 
time and therefore big blind should have about  
33% Equity versus this betting range let's see 
what happens put in this pot siiz bent and they  
are just overfolded like mad here and the reason 
is that bluff to Value ratios on the river don't  
work the same way on turn and flop if you go 
check out my leverage video you'll see that  
they actually compound the reason for that is 
because when cut off bets and gets called the  
hand isn't over they can then bet turn and River 
they can keep repolarizing and attacking you again  
and again and again so what actually needs to 
happen is you're not looking for 33% Equity you're  
looking to capture 33% of the expected value of 
the pot and that's not going to happen against an  
opponent who's super polarized like this because 
you're just not going to realize your Equity with  
hands like 10 and nines and eights and such and 
so this is the concept of polarity solvers will  
drastically overfolded especially on earlier 
streets versus very polarized ranges even if  
those ranges are laying the quote unquote correct 
pot odds simply because of Leverage uh and this is  
why if we go back to the GTO solution here you'll 
find that it was actually bluffing quite a bit  
more than a third of the time in fact about 2third 
of the time it was bluffing with hands as weak as  
ace high King High and worse so on the Flop you 
need to be bluffing more than on later streets the  
next fundamental imbalance is elasticity this this 
is probably the most dangerous one now elasticity  
is a term I borred from economics which means how 
sensitive is their response to pricing if they're  
highly elastic then they're very sensitive to 
pricing whereas if they're inelastic they are  
insensitive to pricing so for example an inelastic 
player May fold the same hands regardless of bet  
size call these hand classes regardless of bet 
size etc etc now this is not one or the other  
it's not binary it's more of a scale uh where GTO 
would be the most elastic and most people you know  
human implementation wise are less elastic than 
GTO novices being the least elastic so I'm going  
to show you how to take advantage of a an opponent 
that isn't elastic enough with their bat sizing  
and I'll show you why this is such a dangerous 
exploit in the first place for this next example  
I've chosen a small blind versus cut off three 
bet pot as you can see I've given it two sizes  
20% and 66 and it happily splits between both bat 
sizes now what were to happen if we were to make  
make cut offs response less elastic versus this 
bet size so what do I mean again by less elastic  
well I mean that it's going to kind of fold and 
call and race similar hand classes either way so  
what we'll do to demonstrate this first of all 
I'm going to have them fold all of their trash  
then I'm going to have them call all of these 
weak hands and they can adjust their best and  
good hands as they see fit so now we're modeling 
strategy that always folds the trash ends always  
call these kind of medium strength Showdown value 
hands and we'll do the same thing against the  
larger bet size so it's already folding all of 
this trash so we'll just lock that in place and  
then we'll have it call these medium strength 
hands either way hold these so same strategy  
they have to call medium strength hands they have 
to fold trash hands and the top of the range is  
free to adjust as it pleases what I'm seeing 
here is that part of the range is relatively  
inelastic right A lot of these bet sizes are 
now kind of locked in place so if we take a  
look at how small blind has adjusted we'll see 
that now they've just started range beding for  
this small size and part of the reason for this 
well now they're over folding versus this small  
size obviously so you can just go ahead and put 
a whole bunch of really weak trash in here you'll  
see that we're not representing very strong hands 
with this size right very few sets two pairs over  
pairs mostly we're representing just a bunch 
of nonsense just a bunch of like really weak  
hands and like medium strength stuff that is 
vulnerable and needs protection conversely the  
large size is now getting a bit too much value 
right so what it's done as well is you'll see  
if we just filter for top pair plus most of your 
top pair plus especially your strong top pair and  
such it's all going into the big size and less 
of it is going into the small size in particular  
if we just look at the nutted hens they're almost 
exclusively going into the larger bet size so it's  
just kind of playing face up really strong hands 
that want to get more value going to the bigger  
size and weaker hens that don't care as much that 
just want some cheap fold Equity some protection  
going to the smaller size this is a really common 
exploit in practice but it's also super dangerous  
because when you play your range super face up 
from the get-go like this it's going to leave  
you vulnerable to exploits on later streets so 
for example if we call and we put in let's say  
like a seven or something here you're going 
to see that now we basically just have to to  
range check I think this will be the case for 
the majority of turn cards where um our range  
is just too weak at this point because we put 
all of our hands into this range and force cut  
off to play tight now cut off can attack us pretty 
aggressively and so this is why elasticity is the  
most dangerous exploit because it's probably the 
most exploitable thing you can do in terms of how  
much risk it carries but it's also super valuable 
because hey I mean if they're going to play Super  
face up and not adjust to our sizing then you 
might as well use that to your advantage the  
final fun fundamental imbalance is board coverage 
board coverage is the study of how they distribute  
different hand classes throughout different lines 
and the question we're interested in asking is are  
certain lines over or undersaturated with those 
hand classes a lot of novices when they look at  
a GTL solution they're confused as to why every 
hand class seems to be going into almost every  
line and the reason is scarcity so scarcity is 
this concept that if a hand is scarce within your  
range it's underrepresented and therefore much 
harder to play against so for example a set is  
more deceptive than holding trips because it's 
easy to see trips on a board but it's very hard  
to predict that your opponent will have a set for 
example on flush completing run outs I gave this  
one earlier I'll give it again but imagine you're 
playing against an opponent that always bets their  
flush draws well if the flush doesn't get there 
you know they they're probably over representing  
Bluffs and if the flush does get there you can 
simply over fold against that line because they're  
over representing flush draws so they'll get less 
implied odds with their flush draws because you  
won't pay them off when they get there now imagine 
that you know they bet flop and then they check  
turn and the flush completes on the river well in 
this case you know that this type of player would  
have bet their flush draws therefore they can't 
represent them in this checking line and therefore  
you can run them over and attack aggressively 
so there's lots of uh types of exploits like  
this where the silver will mix different types 
of hands in order to remain unexploitable in  
different lines in practice humans don't do that 
they tend to have very poor board coverage which  
opens up exploitative ideas another common example 
is top heavy three bding range so some players are  
very Broadway focused with their three bets 
for example you know lots of King Jack Ace 10  
Queen Jack Etc well three bets should be somewhat 
topheavy if they're too topheavy and they don't  
have enough of for example the suited connectors 
the wheel aces all of this stuff they're going to  
be struggling on a lot of different types of 
boards and so this is why a silver will tend  
to mix in a little bit of everything into these 
lines so that it can represent strong hands on a  
wide variety of runouts board coverage can be 
difficult to recognize in practice but let me  
show you a few very common examples of how you 
can use this to your advantage for this last  
example I've chosen a slightly deep stacked small 
blind versus cut off three bad pot and this video  
is already getting too long so I'm just going to 
do the flush draw example I alluded to earlier  
now you'll notice I've switched into horizontal 
mode vertical mode looks like this horizontal mode  
shows each combination in the range individually 
and that's going to come in handy what we're  
going to do is we're going to node log them to 
always Barrel their flush draws and we're going  
to go through each and just force them to barrel 
flush draws so they do this they call and they  
can adjust the rest of their strategy as they 
see fit we'll put a 10 on board node lock this  
same thing always barreling the flush draws okay 
they can still try and remain balanced with this  
that's fine and then we'll complete the flush at 
the end and you can see all of a sudden it starts  
to check these flushes as a trap you can see if 
we check here we're supposed to be barreling with  
like a bunch of top pair and we also have have 
some flushes but let's imagine that again they  
Barrel these flushes on the river and so we're 
still calling like a pretty decent amount here  
versus this bet but note that small blind needs 
to find some like kind of absurd Bluffs here so  
for example what happens if we just decrease the 
Bluffs very slightly let's just make just these  
hands check we haven't changed their strategy 
much we're just decreasing their Bluffs ever  
so slightly right so their whole range is locked 
but now they're under bluffing and now you can see  
we're folding way more obviously still calling 
with some flushes but even start folding like  
some of the lower flushes here which is a little 
surprising but the point is that if your opponent  
is always putting flushes into certain lines then 
it becomes pretty face up and essentially what  
happens is they're losing implied odds because now 
they're not getting paid off by very many worse  
hands when they Barrel unless they're finding 
like a lot of ridiculous Bluffs to go along with  
it uh moreover the other exploit is that for 
example let's say they check and let's say we  
check behind and we get an ace well remember that 
they always Barrel their flushes or their flush  
draws now that they don't have flush draws we can 
play pretty aggressively right you can see 171%  
pot 100% pot we can be very very aggressive on 
these flush completing runouts if they've checked  
because we've made the assumption that they're bar 
their flush draws right and this is the same for  
any hand class if any one particular line becomes 
too saturated with certain types of hand classes  
especially when it comes to SEI Bluffs essentially 
those hands will lose implied odds because it's  
more obvious that your range contains too many 
or not enough of this type of hand I've heard  
players call this the concept of scarcity like 
I said earlier hands that are not in your range  
very often it's harder for your opponent to defend 
against those but in this case or in the last case  
I should say where they're putting all of their 
flushes into one line and onto other lines it's  
the opposite right it's too saturated in one line 
now this exists in other spots so if their range  
is just Broadway hands for example it's pretty 
easy to play against this type of three betting  
range because you probably have them crushed on 
all of the midling and low boards and you can just  
fold like crazy if the board comes like 10 Queen 
Ace right this is the concept of board coverage  
and this is why solvers tend to mix different 
hand classes and try and ensure that they can  
represent value on many different types of runouts 
let's recap what we've learned today's lecture was  
all about the five fundamental EMB balances and 
this will give you a starting guide to learning  
exploitative poker the first major imbalance 
is betting volume which asks the question of  
what lines they're putting in more money those 
are the lines you want to redirect your nutted  
hands to keep in mind that GTO Solutions are 
often built on the assumption that your nutted  
hands will make the same money in for example the 
betting in the checking line or the big bets and  
the small bet line but in practice typically one 
line is going to be far more profitable against  
the human opponent Equity management asks the 
question of first of all how do they value their  
Equity are they over or undervaluing certain 
hand classes and how can we take advantage of  
that and secondly where are they putting their 
strongest hands are they putting a lot of their  
nutted hands into one line but not the other line 
well that's a crucial piece of information then  
we have polarity and polarity asks about their 
General range construction are they too polar are  
they too condensed are they using some huge size 
representing nutted hands that they'd never have  
here if so maybe that's a bluffing imbalance 
and we can attack this by modulating our bet  
sizing as well next there is elasticity which 
asks the question of how sensitive they are to  
pricing are they going to fold this or that hand 
kind of regardless of bet size are they going to  
call this or that hand class regardless of V size 
well that creates incentive for you to play your  
hand strength and finally there is board coverage 
which asks if certain hand classes are over or  
under represented in their range and this creates 
some clairvoyance allows you to play against that  
range more easily so you'll know when they've 
improved a lot and when they haven't improved  
at all these five fundamental imbalances will 
guide your exploitative strategy and allow you  
to build more complex exploits going forward
