### TOPIC: the mechanics of bluff catching in poker
[Music]
[Music]
Bluff catching is an art that requires a keen 
understanding of your opponent's Tendencies  
a solid grasp of hand reading and nerves of 
Steel in this video we'll break down the key  
concepts of bluff catching share some real life 
examples from the poker world and equip you with  
the tools to make those tough decisions at the 
table before I jump in I wanted to give you an  
outline of what my bluff catching process looks 
like and what is going through my head so the  
first thing I'm thinking about is my hand range 
um how strong of a hand do I have and do I have  
a bluff catcher is this a hand I slow played and 
I'm always going to call on the river um is this  
a hand that I feel like I might be beating some 
Bluffs but I'm not beating a lot of their value  
um is this a hand that I'm always folding am I 
you know what where am I with my hand strength  
that's the first thing that goes through my head 
once I've identified that I have a bluff catcher  
I move on to the next step which is identifying 
both ranges it's important to follow through  
the hand what each range is but it's also good to 
remember what everyone has from the start to the  
Finish because that's going to allow you to have 
a picture in your head of what their strong hands  
look like and what their weak hands look like 
and how your hand falls within that range then  
I'm going to think about my blockers am I removing 
those strong hands am I removing the weak hands  
how do my blockers affect their range and and 
how do they affect my calling frequency that is  
most of the time going to be what determines at 
the end of my decision whether or not I'm going  
to Bluff catch so let's jump into the example and 
throughout the whole hand you're going to hear a  
lot of these Concepts being discussed mainly the 
hand strength identifying both ranges and the uh  
discussion of blockers let's walk through the 
hand that I'm going to use for our scenario we  
open Ace Queen off in the cut off and we get three 
bet by these small blinds this is a scenario in  
which I am going to have a high frequency call 
a queen off in position here going to defend  
and so we defend the Flop becomes 862 uh this 
is a board texture in which villain is going  
to have a lot of checks uh the three bet range 
from the small blind is going to contain a lot  
of Broadway cards so whenever you see a texture 
that has uh low cards eight and under low cards  
N9 and under 10 and under you're going to see a 
high frequency check raise from the small blind  
with the strong hands and a mix of check raising 
with some weaker hands uh but let's take a look  
at the actual solution from GTA wizard here's the 
solution of the scenario that we were just looking  
at 862 flop and we can see that the small line 
does in fact have a high frequency check so I'm  
going through all of these nodes because it's 
really important to understand that getting to  
the river and Bluff catching in that scenario 
is going to require an intense knowledge of  
all of the ranges prior so if we don't understand 
what villain is repping by the river it's really  
difficult to understand what hands are going 
to be Bluff catches so it is important to not  
only study just the river for Bluff catching but 
also the ranges leading up to the river so that's  
why we're covering them right now so we take a 
look here and like I said we're going to see a  
lot of checking from the small blind we have 
the option of either betting uh with our Ace  
Queen for a small sizing or checking back in game 
I decided to check back so as we play the video we
continue you can see my thought of possibly 
betting small ever a bet when check
to not sure we get to the turn and the turn Pairs 
and the first interesting node is that the small  
blind decides to lead for a large sizing now this 
is a sizing that isn't necessarily in the solution  
for GTO wizard but it is a very common sizing 
in game so first we're going to look at what GTO  
wizard Solutions want to do against the sizing 
and then we're going to node loock to show the  
difference between what reality might be for the 
players in the pool so in game like I said villain  
used a large sizing however GTO wizard wants to 
use the overbet as the solution in this scenario  
and that's because on the turn we're going to 
have a very polarized range we're going to have  
Aces kings and queens and Jacks that we saw check 
on the Flop and those were the hands that were  
going to check raise at a high frequency we also 
could have an eight as the small blind hands like  
ace8 suited which are going to be included in 
their range so it makes sense to have a overb  
polarized range for the turn as the small blind 
after the action goes check check so we see here  
that the sizing is an overb and in that is going 
to be including uh Aces kings queens Jacks um 8X  
right all of these hands now when we're facing 
the overb as the cut off you'll see that Ace  
Queen becomes indifferent to defending and that's 
because we have a lot of strong hands that we can  
check back the Flop with however this hand is a 
good hand to Bluff cat because it blocks a lot  
of the strongest parts of villains range so it 
blocks Aces it blocks queens and it blocks Ace  
8 suited for the particular combo that I had um 
so in my head I was thinking okay I'm blocking a  
lot of their value uh we have some Showdown value 
because some of their weaker hands should be hands  
like 109 suited uh Broadways that didn't really 
want to bet the Flop but now get to the turn and  
are trying to you know fold out our strong uh 
King highs or Ace highs that check back so they  
may have some Broadways that want to Bluff here 
so if we look through the solution uh for their  
weak hands or their trash hands rather you'll 
see that the overb hands that are going going  
to get to the turn that don't have much Equity 
are going to be those King High Queen High Jack  
High 109 type hands so against the week hands 
we actually have a lot of value uh to show down  
with and against the Str strong hands we have very 
significant blockers so that's going to be one of  
the keys to Bluff catching is blocking the value 
and unblocking the weekends as well as beating  
the weekends let's continue with the hand in 
progress so we do face the large size defend the
turn and the interesting part that we've all 
been waiting for villain shoves all in and  
we're facing a tough decision now first I want 
to go over what my thought process was in game  
so I'm just going to click play and you guys can 
hear what I was actually thinking in game while  
I was thinking through uh the fundamentals 
and theistic for making a big call in this
spot um we're blocking the value pretty dang  
heavily they're repping Queens Kings 
Jacks and Aces and we block Aces and  
queens they ever have 109 suited if they 
ever have some random like Broadway hand
and so you can hear my past self going over 
what their range is um and I actually do a  
pretty good job not to Pat myself on the back 
of thinking through all of their value all of  
their weak hands and then thinking okay does 
this hand have the appropriate blockers for um  
blocking the value unblocking the weak hands 
and uh is it you know a spot where I want to  
Bluff catch got to make a big call here I don't 
think they're shoving Ace King either another  
important thought is that sometimes villain might 
have Ace King as a semi Bluff and if they do uh  
we look pretty silly making a big call here 
but I in game thought that they weren't going  
to have those combos I thought maybe if they 
were going to bet turn with Ace King that it  
wouldn't turn those hands into a bluff it would 
rather choose um something like King high or  
queen high or ten high before uh the villain 
chose to Bluff asai H why do I want to call
here so let's have a look before we look at 
the results of what to think about and what  
the fundamentals are of making a big Bluff catch 
in this scenario now that we're at the river we  
can talk about the fundamentals of bluff catching 
one of them being MDF minimum defense frequency  
this is a concept that has been covered a lot in 
Prior videos of GTO Wizards Library so if you're  
not familiar with that concept I suggest you 
review some of the videos that cover it because  
we're not going to get into the nitty-gritty math 
about MDF today but just understanding what MDF  
is and looking at an equilibrium will give you 
a good idea of the Core Concepts uh for Bluff  
catching but today I'm going to Deep dive into 
using blockers and our real life example that  
I pulled up for us today the first thing that 
I like to think about before I Bluff catch is  
what is villains range so let's take a look at 
the scenario in which the small blind shoves  
the river so they shove the river and I like to 
think about the value hands first so what are  
their best hands and what are their good hands 
because these are going to be the hands that  
are classified as typically value bets um after a 
certain Equity threshold using the equity buckets  
you can determine that it's very likely that the 
solver is looking to get value from these hands if  
they have a certain amount of equity so Aces kings 
queens Jacks these are all fairly intuitive value  
bets from small blind you can also see that we 
have some top pair here like King Jack and queen  
Jack that might have been bluffing on the turn 
but get there on the river um we have some trips  
that would have slow played on flop as well as 
starting to bet turn and river and then we have  
some of the more obvious uh slow plays like quads 
um a little bit of the you know pocket Nines in  
there which might be the bottom part of villain's 
value range uh so it's important to understand  
what the value range looks like next I'm going 
to look at what their weaker hands are going to  
be so in this this case it looks like there are 
no weak hands that are bluffing there are only  
trash hands which makes a lot of sense because if 
you have a polarized range as the small blind and  
you're bluffing here you're going to Bluff a very 
polarized range which means you're going to have  
hands with very little equity and hands with a lot 
of equity so that's why you see the best hands and  
the trash hands have the most common frequency 
uh in villains range so looking at the trash  
hands it looks like they are bluffing hands like 
King High uh Queen high and 10 high so a fairly  
narrow range here for bluffing but it does make 
a lot of sense because the Jack did come on the  
river so those Jack High hands aren't going to be 
a bluff anymore they're going to be value next I  
like to look at my range what are the hands at 
the top of my range and what are the hands that  
are classified as Bluff catchers um now this is 
a word that is thrown around a lot but typically  
your bluff catch maters are going to be the hands 
that are indifferent to calling by the river so we  
can take a look at the different Equity buckets 
again uh for our range and we can see here that  
the best hands are going to be very intuitive 
calls most likely it's going to be very strong  
hands that get to the river that are at the top of 
our range so hands like Aces kings queens Jacks we  
have some trips in there some full houses and 
some ACE Jack if we decided to float the turn  
with those combos as well so those are the hands 
that aren't too difficult to understand that you  
need to call otherwise if you're not calling 
these combos villain is going to print money  
by bluffing their entire range and we don't want 
that so looking at the next category you have some  
good hands there aren't too many good hands in 
this one simply just Queen Jack suited because  
these are going to be hands that have enough 
equity but are also maybe blocking top pair um  
again if you float the turn with a hand like Queen 
Jack and you hit a jack uh it's it's pretty likely  
that you're going to need to call the river with 
it as well because uh one of the reasons you're  
floating the turn with Queen Jack is so that you 
can have some coverage on a queen or Jack River  
or that you're also covering villains good hands 
of pocket queens and pocket Jacks and so that you  
have um a hand to Bluff with if the action goes 
check check so another hand that is pretty fair  
uh pretty intuitive to to call on River um then we 
start getting to the weekends these again uh same  
idea we're going to have typically the stronger 
part of our range still looking to call and make  
villain indiff and then we get to the trash ends 
these are typically going to be the zero EV Bluff  
catchers that we were talking about um and we see 
my hand in particular right there Ace Queen offit  
in which I am facing a large bet with now thinking 
about my entire range we have a lot of those best  
hands a lot of those good hands but I just got 
to the river with a Queen now what blockers do I  
have to their value what blockers do I have to 
their weekends do I have too many blockers to  
their weekends are they going to Bluff enough on 
the river what is my uh Bluff catching frequency  
going to look like these are all questions that 
I like to ask myself before I click call so let's  
take a deeper dive into all of our different 
combos in this scenario first off we have hands  
that want to Bluff catch like 65 Suited this is a 
good example in this particular scenario of a hand  
that blocks value and unblocks Bluffs if we take 
a look at the small blinds bluffing range again  
we will see that they prefer a lot of Broadway 
combos as well as 109 suited this is a spot where  
we unblock Bluffs clearly and then if we take a 
look at their best hands the value hands we are  
blocking a value hand of pocket sixes obviously 
this is a scenario where we unblock Bluffs we  
block the value hands that's why we see the solver 
call at a 100% frequency with that hand and if we  
take a look at our hand in question Ace Queen 
offit it's a little bit trickier so again let's  
take a look at the hands that Ace Queen blocks 
for value and unblocks as the weak hands so if  
we filter for the bust hands first and we go all 
in as small blind we'll see that we are in fact  
blocking hands like pocket aces ace8 suited um 
pocket queens and queen Jack suited so these are  
all good hands to be blocking which is why Ace 
Queen is considered a good hand to Bluff catch  
now if we take a look at the trash hands there 
are some hands in which we are blocking which is  
not the best right so if we see the all in here 
we'll see that we are blocking some combos of  
king queen uh as well as Queen 10 and king queen 
off suit so yes we are blocking value uh well but  
we're also blocking some of the Bluffs so this 
isn't the most ideal hand however because of MDF  
and because we need to make villain indifferent 
to bluffing we need to add some of these Bluff  
cachers in which is why we see some of these zero 
EV calls with hands like Ace Queen um because we  
are still blocking a lot of the value even though 
we're blocking a few of the Bluffs let's take a  
look at a combo that is actually stronger than 
Ace Queen however it's a worse Bluff catcher  
and that's Ace King offsuit so if we look at our 
call range here from the cutoff and we look at the  
Ace King offsuit combos we'll see that it's an 
actual pure fold even though it is technically  
better than Ace Queen offit now why is that well 
if we look back at the small blind again we'll  
see their bluffing range is going to Ain a lot of 
King X in it right so there's a lot of blocking  
these Bluffs here and if we look at the value 
hands you'll see that there's only a few combos  
of Aces that are going to take this line as the 
small blind um kings are there King Jack suited  
King jack off suit but if you take a look at the 
value versus The Bluffs that Ace King blocks Ace  
Queen does a better job of blocking the value so 
that's why we see Ace Queen be a call and Ace King  
be a fold in our range also that being said when 
we have Ace King it's less likely they have some  
weaker checkback um like Ace King themselves which 
is going to be in their range so you can see here  
villain doesn't choose to Bluff Ace King and like 
I mentioned in game it was really important that  
I knew villain wasn't going to Bluff Ace King 
because then obviously calling Ace Queen might  
not be good either so it's a very delicate balance 
when you're looking at an equilibrium and thinking  
about MDF which combos are going to be in our 
Bluff catching range which combos are going to be  
in our always call range which hands are going to 
be in our fold range so these are the things that  
you need to be thinking about when you're going 
through all of the different [Music] concepts  
we're blocking the value pretty dang heavily the 
repping Queen Kings Jacks and Aces and we block  
Aces and queens if they ever have 109 suited 
if they ever have some random like Broadway
hands got to make a big call here I 
don't think they're shoving E King
either uh why do I want to call here
oh let's [Music]
go
