### TOPIC: the mechanics of cbet sizing
all right how are you guys doing today
good i hope let's begin so this lecture
is about the mechanics of c-bet sizing
and
this is
kind of a contentious subject because
people have very different opinions
about what's correct what reasons you
should bet and why you should size stuff
i'm going to go over some general
heuristics
as well as
some of my own personal research
now
before we get started i want to run a
poll
what do you guys think dictates bet
sizing
okay i've just launched that feel free
to select multiple answers
let me know what you guys think
[Music]
[Music]
okay we've got some mixed results here
so
nut advantage here's a lot of people
agree there range advantage
polarity spr
yeah and the truth is everything does
factor in to some degree
some more than others and it's not
always clear why or how it works
let's start with some very basic
heuristics so
a nut advantage indicates an advantage
near the top of your range you have all
the strongest hands they have mostly
bluff catchers relative to that range
range advantage is more like an equity
advantage throughout
the top half of your range is stronger
than than the top half of theirs and so
on generally speaking nut advantage
dictates sizing range advantage dictates
frequency that's a very rough indicator
it's not always correct
but we're starting with the basics right
now when most people learn
they
go about something like this right
they'll start by just range betting
every flop for a small size
as they study more they'll learn okay
dry board equals a small flop bet a wet
board equals a big bet
and a lot of people just stop here and
if you study with a silver a bit more
you'll learn okay well if it's too wet
then we have to size down again right
you can't just go bombing all monotone
boards right
and as you go on you develop more
advanced heuristics based on texture sbr
position
and all of that is fine
but none of it actually explains
why certain bet sizes are preferred it's
just something you can glean from
studying solvers
so i want to start with
this
we'll call the wetness parabola
this is a very basic sizing heuristic
there's some truth to it but it's
obviously oversimplified so
very dry board for example
typically you'll bet small
as the board becomes more dynamic
there's more draws typically you'll
start to size up
and then as it gets too wet you'll start
to size down again
does anyone use a similar heuristic to
this or have they when they were
learning
so
let me ask you guys something
why do you think it is
that we start sizing down when the board
becomes
too wet
and again i'm going to launch a poll
here this time it's single choice you
can select one
why does the bet sizing decrease when
the board becomes too wet
too many equity changing runouts that's
a popular one too many middling hands in
range
too many nutted hands to contend with
interesting so we're going to explore
exactly why that happens
and i think
the answer may surprise some guys so
let's go over some of the the basic
factors that influence sizing again the
biggest factor comes down to a relative
nut advantage in each range right if
villain has very few nutted hands that
can make your value range indifferent
then you are allowed to bet bigger right
because their value range their nut
nutted hands are their main defense
against over bets and
extended aggression and converse is also
true they have many nutted hands in
range for example maybe a monotone board
or
you know a paired board
well in that case they can make your
value range indifferent
and that prevents you from
being too aggressive a villain
may have
many hands with reasonable equity
against the top of your range
this may be an indication that you
should bet bigger or they may have
you may have a lot of fold equity
if you saw my last lecture i don't
define fold equity is how often they
fold rather i define it as the value of
fold equity which is to say
how much value did you actually gain
folding out those hands right if those
hands have no value against you did you
actually gain anything by making them
fold
so
lots of draw equity lots of equity
against the top of your range makes you
want a bet bigger
and if those same hands have no equity
against the top of your range you'll
typically bet smaller of course you have
to consider if you have sufficient
nutted hands or even value hands in your
range
and the number of middling hands in your
range you have fewer middling hands to
protect
well
you're allowed to bet bigger because
less of your value range is devoted to
protecting the middling hats
of course the opposite is also true
so before we
proceed please reach out to me with any
questions you may have
feel free to type in the chat or just
speak up but if it's all going well
let me know
all right
let's proceed
so let's go on with bet sizing mechanics
villains nutted hands prevent you from
overbetting them to death this is why
nut advantage is such a strong indicator
of bet sizing range advantage actually
isn't a huge indicator of how big you
should bet
dry boards tend to have low incentive to
bet big due to low value fold equity and
lack of draws against the top of your
range as we discussed the last one if
you get them to fold a hand that has
literally no equity against the value
portion of your range
it's not actually such a huge win
um
so wet boards tend to have a higher
incentive to bet due to a larger higher
value of fold equity and more draws that
have equity against the top of your
range
extremely wet boards tend to have a wide
variety of nutted hands in both ranges
which prevents you from over extending
the top of both ranges get dragged down
towards the middle
and if you start bombing like a very wet
board you can become quite exploitable
the middle of your range
drags down your nutted hands as these
hands need to be protected the more
middling hands you have the more
protection is required
and this of course relates to polarity
so
let's start with just an over bet
indicator one of the most prominent
indicators that i could personally find
are situations where a large portion of
your range is currently ahead of most of
fill ins range but your equity with
these hands is not reflected in that so
for example you are currently ahead of
98 of their range but you only have 80
equity this discrepancy between being
ahead now and not so much later
creates an incentive to bet very
aggressively it doesn't really have a
name so i'm just going to call it the
vulnerable nut theorem and
let me show you guys a few examples of
this
so we have the classic ace king 5
board these are very commonly known to
be over bed boards but let's take a look
so
let's take a look at a hand like ace
jack
ice jack is ahead of
pretty much all of big blind's asex it's
82 percent equity
and
big blind's
only hands that beat it
are two pairs and sets and they only
have about three percent of those in
range so you're ahead of 97 of their
range with ace jack yet you only have 82
percent
uh similar story with ace queen
so
what do you do when you have a hand
that's way ahead of most of their range
but
doesn't have that much equity
well
the overbet
show you another example here
so this asymmetry means two things
buttons strong top pairs a lot of
incentive to play aggressively
more importantly big blind doesn't have
the nutted hands to prevent us from over
betting so here's another one we have
it's small blind versus big blind single
raised pot
and we can see here that
small blind has nines
and
big blind only has about two percent of
hands in their range that are currently
ahead of nines
yet this hand only has 77 of equity
so
if we look at that
nines is currently ahead of 98 of their
range yet it only has 77 equity again
this discrepancy this vulnerable nut
theorem whatever you want to call it
is an indicator that
these hands want to play very
aggressively
not only because the value of fold
equity is quite high
but also because they can't fight back
and so we'll see here that for example
nines prefers a 300 over bet
if given the choice
same with tens jacks ace eight all of
these hands are currently ahead of like
98 of their range
and lastly we have
jack 10 8 this is a small blind versus
button three bet part
we can see for example a ham like ace
jack on jack 10 8
is currently ahead of about 90 percent
of their range
uh
yet it only has 62 percent equity
ace is ahead of 93 percent of the range
only has 69
and again these kind of spots where you
have hands that are just way ahead of
most of their range but
are actually
have a lot less equity well
that will indicate
that it wants to take a very aggressive
line such as just shipping it
on the flop
so what questions do you guys have about
this
anyone
what drives middling sizes eg 75 that's
a good question and to be honest what is
a middling size
is
kind of
related to the spr
i'm actually going to explore that very
soon though
so keep that question in mind
sorry is it fide i'm going to
get back to it
so anyway this vulnerable nut theorem
it's something you can use in game if
you know you're going to be ahead of a
large portion of their range
and you also know that you don't have
the equity that to reflect that
that creates a huge incentive to bet
aggressively because the value of fold
equity is quite high
your nutted hands
can't be countered because they don't
have better hands in range or enough
better hands in range and therefore
you want to bet aggressively
let's move on to the geometric bet size
now some of you may already know what
this is but the bet geometrically means
to bet an equal fraction of the pot on
each street to get all the chips in by
the river this is the ideal bet size
when one player is perfectly polarized
in other words if you have
only the absolute nuts or stone cold
bluff and nothing in between and your
opponent has bluff catchers you'll want
to bet an equal fraction on each street
to get ranges in by the river the reason
for this is that
this strategy
maximizes villain's calling range
so here's what we might call a polarized
range right the defender has middling
hands we have a polarized range
i'm not going to go over the exact math
here but
in general if you just run a simple mdf
calculation you can find
that betting the same size on each
street causes them to defend wider than
if you were to vary your bet size
now in game of course you should vary
your bet size
but we need to be aware of this mechanic
to make sense of a lot of other spots
let's talk about stack depth and felting
ranges
so a felting range or we call it a
stack-off range is the portion of their
range that can play for stacks
right if you get all the chips in
uh versus whatever they defend with
hands that are ahead in that case would
be the part of the felting range now it
should be fairly intuitive that
deeper stacks
lead to tighter felting ranges and
shorter stacks lead to wider felting
ranges
why is this well you're putting in more
money when stacks are deeper
and therefore
a range of hands you could stack off
with needs to be able to put in more
money and
your range is tighter
conversely you could also say that
the amount of hands that have to defend
versus all that extra money is a tighter
range overall so
this seems obvious to most people
but
how can we measure this how can we
actually get a sense for what that
percentage of range might be
well again we can use minimum defense
frequency calculations to get a rough
idea of how wide felting ranges should
be
according to stack depth
so
here's a situation uh
there's a graph i made where i've
charted the stacked pot ratio on the
bottom
and the call down or the felting range
on the y-axis
generally
the defending range is going to be
somewhere between the mdf against a
shove and the mdf against three streets
of betting an equal fraction of the pot
so
that's a little complex to look at
here's maybe something easier
or a single raised pot say button versus
big blind
the stack off range is somewhere between
five and ten percent
or
like a medium-sized four-bed pot it's
closer to 36 43
and we can see as the spr goes down
more and more of the range has to be
defended because there's less money to
put in
relative to the size of the pot
so for most single raised pots you can
say okay how well am i doing against the
top 10 percent of their range
so here's an example we have
king queen 9 button versus big blind
single raise pod
in general
this flop prefers a smaller bet
so
here's a question for you
let's say you
could open shove just ship it
and you knew they would defend
the big blind would defend with the top
10 of their range
knowing that
what's the weakest hand you stack off
with
[Music]
some people are saying king nine king
queen nines
i don't know it seems close right but we
can uh
we can try and measure this
so
here's the top ten percent of big blinds
range
and here's our equity against that top
ten percent
for
your hand to be a value bet against that
range
it needs to have at least fifty percent
equity
so
would say king queen is ahead of that
range king 9 is slightly behind king 9
could still maybe call as a bluff catch
in a series of races but king queen
would be
ahead if you got it in so this would be
about
the line of your stack off range
given that they're defending 10
again this is all kind of abstract so
far but
let's imagine that
we remove all the jack 10 from big
blind's range
right they still have everything else we
just removed the jack 10. how badly
would that affect the strategy
no more straights
right we're taking away maybe
somewhere between 12 and 16 combinations
of straights from their range
well
here's our equity against the top 10
percent of their range this is the image
you just saw
and here's that same image
if we calculate the top ten percent of
their range after removing jack 10.
and we can see now that many more hands
uh fit into this category of
you can stack off with this right
queen 9 is almost there king 9's there
even ace king and king jack are almost
close enough
so
how does this affect the actual strategy
though
well
just removing that one nutted combo
shifts
the bet size dramatically
these blue lines
are a baseline solve
the red lines are with
jack 10 removed from big blind's range
as we can see
the bet size increases drastically we
even start throwing in this massive 160
over bet at some frequency
and that's the power of just a few
nutted hands in range
now many more hands
can play for stacks
so by removing the nutted hands we open
up the option to implement larger bet
sizes because
they'll be less exploitable big blind is
less able to counter those sizes
notice that
in the original one we're mostly going
somewhere between 25 and 40 small sizes
only
just a little bit of 80 percent
so what about 200 big lines deep
well let's go back to gto ranges
and let's see how it plays 200 big
blinds deep
as you can see
mostly
checking 67 of the time
um in this case these are the simple
ranges so big lines forced to check
but we can see that
as
the stack size increa as the stack
increases as the spr increases uh
those nutted hands count for so much
more
and that alone is going to make it much
harder to implement a wide strategy
the nutted hands are the only defense
against over bets removing too many
nutted hands gives the opponent the
option to over bet and apply a lot of
pressure although that won't always be
their best option they'll have that
option
and as stacks get deeper the nut
advantage becomes more important right
that top three percent of their range
counts for so much more when you're 200
big blinds deep because the stack off
ranges are so much tighter
let's move on to the question of
how the middle of your range influences
sizing
here
we've got a funky spot
cut off versus small blind four bed pot
flop is ace 10 9 two tone
why is small blind donking on ace 10 9.
shouldn't that be better for the four
better
very strange
well let's take a look
what do you guys think that is i haven't
prepared a poll for this one so feel
free to just type in the chat
there we go
why do you think it is
that small blind likes the donk on ace
10 9.
nut advantage for out of position okay
interesting interesting all right sam g
can you see the ranges now
yes so it is interesting to see that
they're donking here
about 40 of the time
and
let's go back to the ranges for a second
small blind
well
they have less ev
and significantly less equity overall
we look at the equity graph
we're the blue line we do not have a
range advantage
we don't really have a nut advantage
either
maybe
a fraction of hands up there but not
really ahead
in any meaningful sense
we do have yeah nines tens tens nines
that's important to note
we just note
these two pair hands
that's right of course they have more
aces ace ten and ace nine
uh
so
slightly more sets in two pair but keep
in mind the spr is quite low here so we
have to consider for example
top half of the range top 50 or so
and
even then we're not doing fantastically
so
the main reason
why it's donking here has to do with the
middle of the range rather than the top
or bottom
every hand in our range
is kind of worthless it's either very
valuable or completely worthless right
like eight seven sixes these are
worthless
nines
tens ten nines ace queen ace jack very
valuable
king ten no hard worthless kingdom with
a heart very valuable right we don't
have a whole lot of middling in between
hands worth protecting it here
so wouldn't the nut advantage exist more
for in position than out of position
donking because we have middle strength
hands
that can extract defend value
right so we actually don't have the nut
advantage not really um maybe a tiny bit
definitely not the range advantage and
we're definitely behind
so
the reason
it's betting here has more to do with
the fact the middle of your range simply
isn't worth protecting
let's see what happens when we check and
they bet i don't know
say 25.
you barely have a calling range most of
your range is folding we're way
overfolding here
rest is raising
um
it's important to keep in mind that
part of the reason
you check a lot
is to defend your middling hands right
if you don't really have a middling
range then you're
you're kind of naturally polarized right
and so
when all of our ev is split between very
strong hands that want to put in money
and completely worthless hands even if
we don't really have a range advantage
you still want to bet sometimes
so the moral of the story is that no
middling hands
equals not really worth defending your
checking range
now you won't see this often in single
race pots maybe on the river it's a lot
more common in four bed pots and
situations where ranges are much tighter
typically you're going to have a few
pocket pairs that are very valuable
a few over cards that are very valuable
and then a lot of trash so
this mechanic does pop up
in
tighter ranges more often than not
what questions do you guys have about
this
are middling hands turned into dunk
bluffs
usually here
well you don't really have
a bunch of middling hands here right
you have
nothing hands
and strong hands what's the advantage
for the range to donking
let's go back here for a moment
so
you do have a lot of hands that
are ahead right ace queen ace jack tens
ten nine nines
the reason is if you don't
um
if you just range check here
adolf will be incentivized to check back
most of their range
um
and moreover we have the option to bet
while we opt for donk not check yeah
yeah you can see everyone is uh
let me put it another way when the
middle of your range is not worth
defending you have the option to lead
the reason you're used to range checks
in almost every situation where you
check the pre-flop aggressor is because
your
the middle of your range needs to be
defended if you lead out too much value
all of a sudden your checking range
becomes very exploitable in this case
most of our checking range is worth
nothing it's zero ev even before they've
made a bet
so
it's not worth defending
now the advantage to leading out is that
if you don't they can just check back a
lot and we lose some value
how not to over bluff here once we dunk
well that's a matter of implementation
continuum versus bit
continuum versus bet polarized right is
this related to mid low connected boards
in
raise pot button versus big blind
so
i'm not sure what you mean by continuum
to bet polarizer continuing to bed
polarized i think is what it says on the
turn
uh sure we can take a look there the sbr
is very low so he can essentially shove
some turns or try and drag it over three
streets
looks like he prefers dragging it over
three streets in this case
uh now you guys can research this spot
some more on your own but you will
notice this quite a bit in your if you
ever study four bet parts
um or after very polarized lines
so you would continue docking on turn as
well based on the logic you shared for
the flop strategy
yeah i mean by
by leading the turn it's not really a
donk anymore it's more of a c bet
because you've already bet the flop but
yeah
um
take a look at turn reports if you like
here
it is leading on most and then on flush
completing turns it is shipping it a lot
if we develop a docking range since we
don't have a middling range worth
defending can't imposition bet any two
cards versus a check what confuses me is
that imposition still ops the check back
yeah and that's because we're not
donking all of our value right
um our dunking range is our checking
range is very polarized here
we could take a look right we are
checking some aces we're checking some
sets we're checking all of our 10 9
some strong top pair so we're not
dunking all of our value we're just
docking some of it and what's left in
our checking range is a mixture of hands
that have
very low ev against their range and
hands that have quite a bit of ev so our
checking range is naturally polarized
now in this case
if we
check they're gonna bet and they're
gonna bet small right most of the time
they're for 10 maybe 25 percent
and the thing is that even if they bet
extremely small they're still going to
overfold massively versus this size
right like what's the mdf against the 25
bet maybe 20 folds
we're folding 50.
and you can see that reflected here
we don't really have much of a calling
range some weak asex lots of raising
so
yeah interesting spot always be aware
that the middle of your range drags down
your nutted hands the middle of your
range makes
your value portion less aggressive
because it needs to be defended
can you pull up
ace king seven
complex what's the reason behind betting
three percent
okay sure
ace king seven
complex
you mean in uh small blind versus
was this spot anyway
small blind versus
cutoff yeah
small blind versus button okay
ace
ace king seven
let's graph that
interesting
so it looks like
this is a spot where every single size
is somewhat playable
um if we just take a look at say the
expected value
you do have a fair amount of everything
in here
uh sorry are you looking at a three bed
part or a four bed pot
i guess a four bed part is
what i was looking at
three percent bet
interesting
so
this looks more like the situation we're
reviewing before
lots of zero ev hands
and lots of stronger hands
in general the theory behind any block
bet is
that
it's an equity realization play
um because typically
they're going to you're going to face
less aggression leading out than you
would checking and facing a bet
the reason you don't normally implement
it is again
uh the fact that your checking range can
become more exploitable
your range is a little more exposed when
you split right on the flop out of
position
but
when that's not the case often the
option becomes available to start
developing a leading range
all right let me get back to my
presentation here
now that we understand how the middling
part of your range relates to the rest
of your range
let's keep going i want to talk about
paired boards for a moment
throughout this lecture we've been
talking about dry or wet boards
is a flop like ace a6
rainbow dry
i mean it should be sounds like a pretty
dry board but what exactly does dry mean
can anyone tell me
is it uh
does it mean there's not a lot of draws
does it mean
something else
perhaps it means there's not a lot of
nutted hands
most range low equity less equity change
on future streets equity is unlikely to
change turn river
polarized
little to no connection hands in range
yeah and the truth is people have
different definitions of this stuff
um
i think i really like the idea that
there's
equities are less likely to change our
turn river you could also say that
fewer parts of the range can outdraw the
top of the range
or little to no connection to hands in
the range that's also good so
what about a6 rainbow
this is
pretty much a ranged bed board
but
why is it arrangement board why do you
bet small
unpaired boards in single raised pots
and launch another poll here just want
to get your guys
ideas
and
you guys have mentioned some good
options that i haven't included in this
poll but gotta start somewhere
risk reward ratio is high that's an
interesting one actually
okay so what do we have here i think
most people think big blinds has many
weekends and will under defend versus
bet okay interesting
so
let's test some of these theories
now i noticed that no one picked too
many nutted hands to contend with
and we don't feel that way because a6
should belong to the button after all
the range betting shouldn't we
get a massive advantage here
i mean it looks like we are right most
of our range is ahead we have
a big range advantage
but we don't have that nut advantage
right and that's because
big blind has a ton of asexual range so
what ends up happening is
it's hard to get
too aggressive with anything that's not
trips here because as soon as you over
extend and start betting huge with say
pocket kings
you know five six stuff like that well
all of a sudden they can start
countering you with
a huge portion of their range which is
trips but okay let's run some
experiments
i'm going to run four experiments on
this flop
what happens if we remove all the trips
from both ranges
what happens if we remove some trash
from big blind's range
i'm going to measure the value of fold
equity
and from there i'm also going to reverse
the positions and see if the trends
remain the same
so the idea behind this
is just to run a battery of tests
just kind of test a few of our
assumptions about why this small bet
so go ahead and make some predictions
here this time there's a few different
questions and
we're going to see
how the strategy changes as we tweak the
parameters
two people responded so far
well i'll keep this open oh we got a
third one interesting so
let's take a look at the first one what
happens if we remove trips plus from
both ranges
that is to say all the sets and the
boats are removed from both ranges and
we resolve with that structure and so
far
people have guessed basically throughout
the board here right some people are
saying check small check more smaller
size range bet small size range by
bigger size over bet
so the full range of predictions are
here let's take a look
so
again the blue line is just my original
solve that's the baseline
and the red
are is button strategy with trips
removed
and as you can see
it sizes up drastically
right it's still
checking about the same amount but now
we're using 80 and 120 bets
um
so
a massive increase in uh
in sizing
and that's mostly due to the fact that
these trips prevent the rest of our
range from getting too aggressive
once you remove that barrier once you
remove
these nutted hands up here
all of a sudden all of that becomes a
massive nut advantage that allows you to
implement
a big bet strategy
so
would we say then that it's because the
board is so dry or more that
we can't get too out of line with huge
bets because there's so many trips in
range that can counter anything that's
not trips in our range
okay so next
we remove some trash from big blinds
range basically i've gone on to gto
wizard i've selected uh i've removed the
trash range anything with less than 25
equity how will this affect our strategy
on the button and again we're kind of
split down the middle here
some are saying check more smaller size
some are saying check more bigger size
obviously you should check more because
their range is stronger
but the question of sizing
then becomes an issue
should you
check or bet more now that their range
is tighter should you size up or size
down
well
you should size up
so here we can see
we're checking more now that the range
is tighter that makes sense
and i'll also point out that they do
dunk about 30 of the time for one third
size i gave them that option
but when they check to us we're betting
bigger
much bigger
and this is because we've increased the
value of fold equity and we're now
targeting some stronger hands
right before we were targeting these
very low value
very weak hands
but now that we've made the range
stronger we're targeting higher equity
hands we're targeting 6x we're targeting
king x we're targeting these pocket
pairs
and you see this again uh you'll see
this in three bet parts and four bed
parts a lot unpaired boards it'll often
size up because the target is shifted
away from air and towards medium strike
fans
and that causes us to use a larger bet
size
so next
i wanted to measure the value of fold
equity the way i do this is i simply
measure
the equity with the made hands in our
range
against their folding range
so on the left here
that's our equity against hands that
will fold versus 125 percent pogba
according to gto wizard right
so we'll notice that for example a hand
like ace deuce has 97
against the range that folds
almost 98. so
when this hand over bets
it's not doing so for any protection
right it gains almost nothing from those
folds because the hands that fold had
almost no equity against us and like for
example 6x will gain more but
surprisingly not that much even had like
kings right you overbet huge kings gains
you know it has the hens that fold have
maybe four percent against kings
this is the same thing except against
the 33 percent pop that so again we can
see that the value of fold equity is not
very high we have massive equity against
their folding range which means the
hands they fold were very much dominated
by us in the first place so
ace a6 the value of fold equity is quite
low
that's why
when
we removed part of these trash hands
from their range
it started to size up because the value
of fold equity is higher now we're
targeting stronger hands these hands
have more equity against the top of our
range
lastly i just reversed the positions
mostly just out of curiosity
most people predicted it would size up
which
is correct
you can see it shifts from mostly a
small bet strategy
using some slightly bigger bets
and the reason for this is because in
positions range which remember this is
now but big blind's range i've reversed
the positions
in general in position has more ev which
increases the value
gained from faults
interesting experiment experiments i ran
a few others with some other flops i can
show you guys
i guess we should summarize first though
ace a6 what happens when we remove trips
plus from both ranges we size up
significantly
what happens when we remove some trash
sizing up again but also checking a lot
more
what's the value of fold equity very low
for most made hands
the hands that fold have virtually no
equity against the value portion of our
range
and if we reverse the positions we size
up slightly because
the ev of their hands goes up a bit in
position therefore the value of fold
equity increases slightly as well
all right that was a lot to take in uh
before i proceed
let me hear your questions
okay no questions
so i ran similar test for queen 83 mono
again it's button versus big blind
so
we'll launch a similar poll here make
some predictions
firstly
we have to take a look at the ranges
what happens if we remove mate flushes
from both ranges
what happens if we remove some trash
from big blinds range
what's the value of fold equity what
happens if we reverse the positions
toolsboy asks a great question am i
mistaken but i thought there is no
incentive to size up bets if the fold
equity is low am i wrong
oh you are correct sir you are correct
um
i wouldn't say no incentive i would say
that there is less incentive
let's go back here for a moment
so
for example here you're not betting
so much to gain fold equity as you are
to get called in this case
and the reason it sizes up so much
when we remove trips from both ranges
is because of this massive nut advantage
that will stack the top of their range
so
bold equity is certainly a big part of
it
uh the other half of the equation is
getting called by worse
perfect so let's go back here for a
second
now
monotone boards are interesting um i
feel like
many
beginner players
they're using that level one heuristic
you know wet board bit big and they'll
just start potting it on these monotone
boards
um
the reason you don't do that of course
is that if you're over playing you're
overextending on these boards you're
going to narrow their range too quickly
your own ranges are going to be quite
exploitable you're going to be
overextended with stuff like top pair
and two pair
and if you play too aggressively
they can counter you and really destroy
most of your value with raises
people associate monotone boards with
very small bet sizes not much raising
small raises but the truth is that
if you get unbalanced in these spots the
silver will just start you know 5x
potting it it'll just start over betting
like crazy if you cap yourself too badly
so
these kind of boards are very precarious
uh highly exploitable if one player
slips up
so
with that in mind
take a look at the range distribution
here you can see that because of the
abundance of flushes in both ranges no
one really has the nut advantage
button has a slight range advantage
throughout
but no nut advantage
now because of that it's typically going
to prefer a smaller size
so what happens if we remove made
flushes from both ranges
more betting and sizing up seems to be
winning
let's find out
yeah so
it's a little bit less betting
but massively sizing up right
i keep in mind i've gotten rid of both
players flushes
not just one player
and that's about six seven percent of
each range but now instead of betting
you know
25 percent it's preferring something
between 80 and 120
in fact this when you remove the flushes
it plays closer to queen eight three two
tone
which the silver will over bet at a
reasonable frequency
so
again
the amount of nuts in each range kind of
dictates
how large you can play in this case when
we got rid of all these
nutted flushes
well now you're up against an extremely
draw heavy range
um
you have an advantage and so
because they have very few hands you
know there's only like three percent two
pairs and sets
now they don't have a whole bunch of not
enhanced to counter you with and you
have a lot of incentive to bet
uh well when that's the case
you typically want to size up
so
here's the same one removed trash from
big blinds range
now
what happens if we remove some trash
kind of
everyone kind of agreed size up less
betting
um in this case
i guess i didn't really give you the
option for the same amount of betting
but
about the same amount of betting overall
but definitely sizing up and it's the
same reason as last time right remove
trash all of a sudden our target shifts
to stronger hands
the value of fold equity is higher so we
bet bigger to target these stronger
hands
here i've measured the equity against
their folding range on the left is
versus an over bet on the right is
versus a 33 bet
i'm just showing buttons
made hands excluding flushes because
flushes have almost 100 against the
folding range
so
we can see that there is some decent
fold equity here right like no hand is
really that safe
um
every hand gains something
even if using a small size and more so
with a large size
so there's definitely some reasonable
fold equity to be gained on queen eight
three
lastly i reverse the positions again
just kind of out of curiosity
now most people predicted sizing up
less betting
in this case
there is significantly less bedding and
kind of sizing down
and this is related to the
exploitability
of
of your range again i mentioned at the
start that queen 83 highly exploitable
if one player gets out of line if one
player caps themselves
um and moreover the value of implied
odds withdraws
uh goes up
where was i
yeah the value of implied odds goes up
tremendously in position which is a
major advantage on monotone boards
so
experimental outcomes
if we remove flushes again we size up
significantly if we remove trash we size
up again but also checking more
value fold equity is kind of low to
medium depending on the size
but it's still a reasonable amount of
fold equity and
checking a lot more if we reverse the
positions
okay last one no pull for this one
i think you guys have the gist
so jack nine five two tone
uh now at the beginning of this lecture
i told you there was dry boards super
wet boards and then these kind of
in-between boards that just make for the
perfect large bets right if queen a3 was
on the right super wet and ace a6 was on
the left super dry
this one's just in between there's many
draws there's no made flushes or
straights
um
why is a large bet preferred on this
board
well
you could say a lot of reasons i think
part of it's related to that heuristic i
shared earlier
the board is somewhere in between
just draw heavy enough to want a bit big
we have enough of an advantage
to try and bet big it does implement an
over bet range as well as a 75 bet range
let's explore this a bit in gto wizard
right so we can see we do have
you know a small equity advantage
reasonable ev advantage
um
we look at the equity graph
we're not you know we have a range
advantage
but importantly
what i want to point out here
is that
big blind only has 3.4 percent of hands
that are two pair plus right that means
if you have ace jack
you're ahead of like 97 of their range
right now
doesn't mean you have that much equity
of course
but you are currently ahead of that many
hands
right
and whenever you see that heuristic
typically the strategy is going to be to
bet big
and indeed it does prefer an over bet or
at least a large bet
with most of its value range
so i ran some similar experiments what
happens if we remove all the two pair
plus from both ranges what happens if we
add a bunch of draws the big blinds
range
what is the value of fold equity
removing all the two pair plus
we see again it sizes up significantly
uh
even this small range is enough to
counter
too much over betting and here we start
to implement this 160 size
extra draws
we can see that um
we are betting less often because
basically what i did was i gave them
all the flush draws 10 8 and queen 8 in
full sorry 10 8 in queen 10 full so they
have all the draws
uh which increases
our incentive to bet large
but decreases our advantage so we check
more often and when we do bet
we use a larger size
value of fold equity
um
well
on the left we can see that it's quite
high right even our very nutted hands
you know even something like ace jack
only is 85 percent
and that's against the hands that fold
right so there's some pretty reasonable
fold equity going on with this one
but not
as much if we bet small
just recapping it here
so
in conclusion bet sizing is complicated
the incentives around bet sizing largely
relates to nut advantage
and the value of fold equity the spr and
the portion of nutted hands in each
range dictates which hand can play for
stacks which ultimately controls bet
sizing the middle of your range acts as
an anchor which the top of your range
must adequately defend it's dragging
down some of the value hands because the
middle of your range must be defended
fold equity acts as an incentive to bet
if you only fold out hands that have no
equity against the value portion of your
range
then the value of fold equity is quite
low and the opposite is of course also
true anyways that's it for my lecture
guys uh please bring on any questions
you may have i'd be happy to answer
middling sizing what would make us
choose it in general fide asks
that's a good question i didn't put this
in my presentation although i thought
about it but typically
when you have a large
range advantage throughout the middle of
your range you have a lot of middling
hands that are incentivized to put money
in typically that's going to indicate
more of a smaller sizing sorry you're
asking not middling hands but link
sizing i would say that mid link sizing
is what happens when the incentives are
somewhat balanced between a larger size
and a smaller size yeah i suppose i only
really showed extreme examples here but
perhaps in the future i can demonstrate
some more of the middling sizes
thank you for coming everyone i really
appreciate your support and of course if
you have any questions just let me know
we got some more questions here do you
recommend simple solution of 3366 and
130 or general i find it difficult to
know how to use 50 size uh personally i
like the general solutions but it to
each their own um really depends what
you're trying to do if you're going for
implementation then simpler is often
better if you're trying to find trends
then often you'll want more sizes to get
a better idea of how the spot works and
changes but that's a subjective question
really to each their own
all right guys i think we can end it
here uh have yourself a great thursday a
great night or friday morning wherever
you are and good luck on the grind
