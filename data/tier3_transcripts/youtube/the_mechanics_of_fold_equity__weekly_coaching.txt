### TOPIC: the mechanics of fold equity
all right everyone how you guys doing
good i hope welcome welcome so
today i'm going to be doing a lecture on
the mechanics of fold equity i'm filling
in for solo at the moment he's off for
vacation so hope you guys enjoy and feel
free to stop me at any points along the
way
and let me know if you have any
questions
so
why bet
what are some of the reasons to bet
range advantage nut advantage leveraging
polarity getting your opponent to fold
or getting them to call
there's a number of reasons but why
specifically
do you want to bet of course one of the
primary reasons is fold equity and in
this lecture i'm going to focus
specifically on this mechanic now
there's a whole range of reasons why you
might want to bet
but i'm going to focus specifically on
fold equity now what is fault equity the
classical definition of fold equity is
just the probability that your opponent
folds times the pot right it's just a
very straightforward equation
but is that really representative of the
situation for example let's say you have
the nuts uh and you get them to fold a
hand that has no equity against you does
that really count as fold equity did you
actually gain anything by getting them
to fold what about folding out hands
that might outdraw you later right the
hand is behind but perhaps it has equity
against you does that count as fold
equity what about hands that can't
outdraw you but might bluff you off a
better hand later
for example uh you might imagine a river
blockbet
so i'm going to launch a poll here what
do you guys think counts as fold equity
interesting so we've got some mixed
results here now this is multiple choice
you can of course select multiple things
we all
mostly agree on the first definition
but the truth is that
the terminology is not super well
defined so that's what i'm going to
focus on today
so here's a simple question
villain has a range that consists of 1
absolute nuts and 99
complete trash and we have everything in
between the spr is one
and of course we have 99 equity against
their range
let's look at this from an equity
standpoint
we have a massive range advantage
right villains range again 99 percent
the nut load 33
and one percent
ace which is the nut high so how should
we in position construct our betting
range they've checked to us with this
range i'm going to launch another poll
here
what do you guys think should we range
bets should we mix the strongest and
weakest hands
range check
or something else
again we get some mixed results some
people are saying range bets and someone
said mixed other people are saying range
check a couple people aren't sure so
let's think about this if we bet what
happens they're going to call their ace
and they're going to fold their 3-3 so
what do we gain by betting right keep in
mind we could always just
check back
well if you put this into a solver it
will range check right despite having
massive equity throughout
you don't actually gain anything when
you bet
right because all you do is fold a hand
that you beat anyway and get called
by a better hand
it doesn't matter that we have a huge
equity advantage we don't actually gain
anything
by betting
that's an important concept to keep in
mind
so by the strictest definitions all of
these hands have the same amount of fold
equity and the same amount of value when
called right well except for the pans
that have a three that block their three
three but
you get the idea
the point is that
if you're going to bet you need a reason
so if we just compare the incentives of
betting to checking we can see we can
check back and win 99 of the time and we
beat their regardless of whether we
better check however we lose an extra
bet against their trap therefore
we really don't have any incentive to
bet now some of the more advanced
players are rolling their eyes oh this
is too easy trust me
it'll get a little more interesting hang
in there
what if we make their range stronger
what if instead of three three and ace
we give them 99
jack jack
and one percent ace now we've made
villains range stronger
should we start betting
again i'm gonna launch a little poll
what do you guys think should we start
betting now that it's jack jack and asas
instead of three three in asics
so most people are voting yeah we're
gonna bet more
and that is the case
in fact
we're gonna bet a lot more the reason is
we now have a reason to bet
right we have worse hands that can try
and bluff them off their jacks and we
have better hands that the jacks might
call
we have an incentive to bluff which
gives them incentive to call which gives
us an incentive to value that so it's
interesting you can decrease your equity
against them and yet
that'll incentivize you to bet more and
so for me i'm always kind of curious how
it shifts as you change the line
so
what i did is i ran sims giving them
three three four four five five six six
seven seven all the way up to king king
and this
fun little pattern emerges
we can see
here they have five five six six seven
seven
how the value of fold equity changes now
it seems that around nine so if they
have
99 99 one percentage ace that's where
you want to bet the most
but we're betting a little bit less
often if they have these weaker bluffs
nine seems to maximize and then trailing
off so why do you guys think this
pattern emerges
because the range becomes more polarized
that's true range does become more
polarized uh it was polarized to start
with though
so 3 3 would be
the most polarized i suppose you could
say giving you know absolute nuts or
absolute trash and nothing in between
um
but we are kind of increasing
the strength of their bluff as it goes
up
so again i'm going to launch a little
poll and i promise i don't have too many
more polls left this lecture
um
what do you guys think
if you're ever unsure just say blockers
yeah so
it maximizes the value of fold equity we
have the optimal number of bluffs to
value bets
yeah
that's basically the right answer so
if we take a look here
here is villains equity with pocket
pairs against our range
now this is a pot size bet you'll notice
nine nine has 33 percent
and if we make a pod size bet
well their pot odds indicate they need
exactly 33 to call so what ends up
happening is we either run out of bluffs
or we run out of value bets
and 99 maximizes
the amount of value to bluff in our
range relative
to uh the bluffing line and so
as you increase
the value of fold equity more and more
of your hands are incentivized to bluff
but as it gets too strong
fewer and fewer hands can value bets to
balance those bluffs or vice versa
so that's why it gets maximized at nine
and we see that nice parabolic pattern
but okay this is all toy game stuff
let's get into something a little more
concrete
so the purpose of betting in position on
the river
is to fold out better hands or get
called by worse hands
if that doesn't happen you simply have
no incentive to bet or raise
what about folding out equity that
cannot draw you later does this count as
fold equity
well
that's an interesting question
let's try this turn exercise so it's a
small blind versus hijack three bet pot
10 10 9 rainbow
um
so we are the pre-flop aggressor we
check
hijack bats start
pots what's our best response
well
someone posted this on the discord the
other day and i thought it was a pretty
interesting spot we can see that the
small blind mostly just raises or folds
there's not a whole lot of calling going
on
we can explore this spot a little bit
more in gtl wizard
so
hijack opens small blind three bets stay
call 10 10 9.
now we are checking about half the time
here
when we check
they typically prefer a small bet
33
and we're hardly
really calling here right it's mostly
raising
so
why do you guys think that is
i don't have a poll this time so you're
just gonna have to let me know what you
think do you think it's because of
some sort of nut advantage
range advantage
something to do with fold equity what do
you guys think
for liquidity
yeah
i mean that is what this lecture is
about so
very good guess absolutely
so if we take a look at the ranges um we
don't really have an advantage here like
hijack is green
they are ahead
and yet
we're raising quite aggressively
over 30 of the time
so people often have this
idea that
you know you're stronger you should
raise more um
that's not always the case
there are incentives to raise and
incentives to call
now if we notice something
hijacks range
doesn't have a whole lot of air right
it's mostly
pocket pairs
strong over cards
things like gut shots
they don't have a whole lot of natural
bluffs
right
and so
that alone may influence
how we play this spot
so here's the gtr response
now this is what they bet and i've
simplified this my own solver solved it
myself
and of course it is raising a lot
what happens if we give hijack more air
you know let me go back here let's say
let's say we give hijack
four or three off suits which is just
like the nut blow what will happen
we could mow
more yeah why is that
it's because you have because you have
some bluff
yeah i it's because there's no incentive
to all of a sudden fold out four three
off so like
there's
yeah that's my answer
excellent answer yeah absolutely so the
thing is right now their bluffs are very
strong right
all of their bluffs have reasonable
equity against uh our overcards against
our air
against some of our natural continues
but if we give them some complete trash
all of a sudden we're less incentivized
to try
and fold out that trash so
sorry three two not four three but
um yeah it doesn't even bet it at full
frequency a little less than half and
all of a sudden
we start calling
a lot more
right i didn't force it to bet 3-2 it
just chose the bet 3-2
and it just stops raising
uh nearly as aggressively starts calling
more
so
when it runs out of bluffs
it kind of forces the silver into this
raise fold line
but as you give it more bluffs all of a
sudden it can create a more balanced
range and
we can start calling a lot more so what
happens if we give it less air for
example let's
let's get rid of some of the weakest
hands you know three two twos fours ace
five some of these suited connectors
what will happen if we
remove some of the weakest hands from
hijacks range
um
we raise more
yeah i'm thinking yeah yeah you you
establish the same situation as before
exactly
yeah same idea they have a little bit
less air here and now the calling range
has completely disappeared it's a pure
race fault
right
so
we see this general
pattern or heuristic emerge it should be
pretty straightforward to understand
as bluffs get stronger the value of fold
equity increases you're less
incentivized to call you're more
incentivized to race
as their bluffs get weaker we see the
opposite effect
the value of fold equity decreases or
more incentivized to call less
incentivized to raised
make sense
did you guys have any questions so far
okay good stuff
um so
here we've got a button versus big blind
single race paw this is a turn example
so king 829
now we've bet one third on the flop big
blind's called
action's on us
and we're thinking about betting 75
on the turn
let's take a quick look at this spot
and we can simplify that a bit
it mostly prefers a medium to large bet
here
don't really have a big range advantage
in fact big blind has
uh a little more equity near the bottom
so if we bet 75 pot
here's how they respond
raising about six and a half percent
calling about 50 folding 42.
everything seems fairly normal so far
so again i'm going to apply a similar
experiment
here we can see that range we just
looked at
let's say that they raise
too polarized
right
so
let's say that instead of
mixing all these
merged hands these semi bluffs let me
just give you an idea what that looks
like
right they've got some combo draws some
flush draws
a few open enders
mixing some second pair third pair so
instead of all of that let's say that
they raise
very very polarized
so now instead they'll have
sets
two pair
and four three off
right
extremely polarized
how do you guys think we'll respond to
this
um we would only call because it's very
similar to
the first like toy game example you gave
with the asus and 33.
yep
yep
exactly
same idea
we can see the equity distribution
here's the gto equity distribution and
here's the
uh super polarized equity distribution
so
as we can see
it just pure calls
it's not even folding anything it's just
a pure call
and that's because again you have no
incentive to raise they have 4-3 and
sets like what are you trying to raise
them off for three for there's
no reason to do that
so
we can also see that there's a bluffing
imbalance because we can call anything
because frankly they have too much for
three in range
so again the opposite experiments
right
now
here i've replaced some of the
worst hands
with
stronger bluffs
and
they're also raising a lot more stuff in
general
here's the gto range here's the new
check raise
lots of raises
the equity distribution looks like this
and you can see the tail end of this has
been shifted
upwards so
again you guys think we'll see the same
pattern here
our response to this extremely draw
heavy raise
is to play a raise fold strategy we've
increased
the value of the bluffs so much that
we have a lot less incentive to call and
a lot more incentive
to fold out those bluffs so
instead of doing a calling range it just
switches to raise fold
uh with
many of the made hands all the top pair
hands like jack nine some semi bluffs
sets so hopefully you guys are seeing a
pattern so far that pattern
is of course this general heuristic that
we observed earlier
as flops get stronger
you shift more to raise fold
right you don't want to call as much you
want to raise more as plus get weaker
you want to call more
less incentivized to raise
and
i know this might be getting a little
repetitive at this point but i've got
one more here
button versus big blind single race pot
jack 86
so
here's the gto range a check with that
75
on the flop this is uh the preferred
sizing for this spot
and here's how the big blind responds
using about a 50 size is what it prefers
so facing that check raise
we are at an equity disadvantage we can
see the equity distribution here
normally we're going to raise about 6.3
fold 37 call 56. everything's looking
pretty normal so far
so in these experiments i've made an
effort to keep the overall bluff value
ratio about the same
uh and just shifted
their
the value of their bluffs such that
their overall frequencies are roughly
the same does that make sense so they're
essentially i'm trying to keep
keep their
frequencies in check
so we can get a fair comparison
so here we have big blind facing 75 bets
they check raised
66 percent
that's what i simplified to
and here is button facing that check
race
on the left we have a super polarized
version of this
where they mostly just raise very strong
hands on the right we have a draw heavy
version of this where they raise
many of their flush draws
strong open enders
uh
and so forth
here's the gto equity distribution
against
that i had solved and here's the one
facing their blood switcher too strong
as you can see the tail end has been
lifted up
and here's the same one where they raise
a little too
polarized and the tail end has been
shifted down
we can see the overall frequencies
there's the gto response
here's the response versus a polarized
check raise as you can see just calling
a lot
and versus the draw heavy check rays
it is calling less and it just
ships it with about six percent
um
so
same idea
but now i have a question for you guys
can you tell me
why is it that
we're basically range calling here
why are we calling so wide
let's just go back for a second we can
see the uh
overall
value region is about the same sorry go
ahead
for the same reason as be as the example
you start
with
yeah i mean
absolutely we want to call more but
what if
uh
all right well let's let's see something
here
even though the value region stayed the
same
the weaker bluffs result in a bluffing
imbalance
a villain needs to adjust by bluffing
less often if they want to generate
folds
so
you need a stronger
value to bluff ratio
when your bluffs are weaker
and we can actually see this with some
pretty basic toy game math so this is a
caveman gto calculator
built on some toy game math the
assumptions are that villain can only
call fold equity is static or balance
there are no blocker effects
so this calculates the ideal value to
bluff ratio
given the assumptions we've laid out
what sizes do you guys want to use maybe
like 30 and i don't know
180 something like that
so
i want you guys to pay close attention
to
the value to bluff ratio on the flop
here it's about 29 say 30 to 70.
30 bluffs sorry 30 value 70 bluffs
now what happens if we decrease
the equity of the bluffs
all of a sudden
we need closer to 50 value 50 bluffs
and that's just
the nature
of how this works
so
if you're going to play an extremely
polarized range you don't get to bluff
as often because your bluffs are weaker
and because of that even though we kept
their value region the same
they were too bluff heavy right if they
wanted to do it properly they needed to
use something like
50 value 50 bluffs
so i gave them a
stronger range here this is maybe 40
percent value 60 bluffs and only now
does button actually start default
again buttons not raising
because
it doesn't have any incentive to raise
their bluffs are too weak
but it is
starting to fold now does that make
sense to you guys wait so
sorry
um can you just like really quick
explain again why
if you're if your bluffs have
like 20 equity versus like a zero
percent equity bluff
why are you
um
like what causes the value to bluff
ratio imbalance just just real quick run
through that again please yeah yeah for
sure so
because
again because now you're getting fold
equity
yeah so
full disclosure what i showed you here
is facing a raise
um this calculator is just assuming
we're just betting three streets in
position against someone who can only
call fold but
in general
the takeaway is that
as your bluffs get stronger
you don't
your value
to bluff ratio
you can have more bluffs so i'm not
presenting this well so the idea is
that
if your bluffs are too weak in order to
achieve
the
same level of balance in order to have
a proper
value to bluff ratio by the river
you will need to start with more value
i see okay
because
your bluffs can't outdraw them
where in this case the bluffs can
outdraw them
therefore you don't need as many uh you
don't need as
many value hands to start with to
achieve the same
level of balance by the river oh i see
so because some of your bluffs end up in
the value range by the river okay
yeah that makes a lot of sense
yeah
um so this math is based on
one of jaundi's books applications
uh so
one of the downfalls is that
it assumes equity is static but in a
real game as you bet
your
value equity might decrease your bluff
equity you know it's not going to be 20
the whole time it's at the river it's
probably gonna be closer to like a
hundred or zero but anyway
just to get the general idea
i found that calculator kind of helpful
so
in other words
big blind needs to adjust their value to
bluff ratio if we're going to play so
polarized
and that's why
those super polar strategies aren't
super efficient people talk about things
like visibility they talk about things
like
you know you can apply pressure on later
streets that's because using some semi
bluffs is simply going to be a more
efficient use of your equity on earlier
streets
you want your bluffs
to have some equity against the value
range
so
how does fold equity affect the cbet
strategy
all right let's say the optimal cbet
sizing
we can say the same rules apply you know
if they're folding ranges less equity
against you then you're less
incentivized to try and generate folds
similarly if
uh
their folding range has reasonable
equity against you you're more
incentivized to generate faults
so typically
oh
sorry about that typically
you want to size down
when their fold equity
is basically worthless like they're
folding hands that have
no chance against your range
and you want to size up when the fold
equity is valuable they're folding hands
that can reasonably outdraw you
another way to say is that perhaps it
costs more to fold out those hands
so
that's one part of it
the other main factor is that optimal
seabed sizing is largely regulated by
the nut advantage
for example you can't just start over
betting a huge portion of your range
if their range is very nutted relative
to your value
so
did you guys have any questions on that
okay
so
let's take a look at aggregate flop
reports
we've got paired rainbow disconnected as
our filters
so we're looking at
the top here this is the overall
frequencies for all flops
and at the bottom these are filtered
such that all the flops are paired
rainbow and disconnected
now in a three bed pot
we see that
it is generally sizing up a bit more
right we start to use these medium and
large bets
whereas in
a single raised pot
fewer large bets fewer medium bets
almost all small bets
why do you guys think that is
and i'm going to launch a little poll
here for you guys
equity realization withdraws miss
can you
set the question again please oh sure so
the question is
why do we size up on paired boards in
three bed pots
and size down oh sorry that should say
single raised pots that's a typo i'm
sorry guys this is button versus big
blind single raised pots not three bed
pot
so we've got a few people who've
answered
now
we can say
bigger nut advantage in three bed parts
bigger range advantage in three bed
parts my personal favorite targeting
more air in single raised pots whereas
we're targeting more medium hands and
three bed pots lower spr fewer trips
proportional to the ranges
right but as we've seen uh
having an equity advantage isn't always
a reason to size up per se
so if you actually compare the ev in the
equity it's hard to really say if you
have a bigger nut advantage on three bed
parts
in three bed pots on paired boards
um compared to non-paired boards
so
you won't always have a ranger nut
advantage but even so it will size up on
these ports you do gain a small
advantage but the primary reasons are
fewer proportional trips at range
like if you take a look at just the
standard button call small blind three
bet they have proportionally more pocket
pairs than they do other hands
and that generally means that
on paired boards
they're not going to have as many trips
but the main thing for me is higher
value of fold equity instead of
targeting their air
you're trying to attack their pocket
pairs right these hands have reasonable
equity against your overcards so when
you're trying to target a stronger hand
when the value of fold equity increases
you generally want to size up and lastly
it's lower spr now you may ask this one
a lot of people went for
but you may ask
well
why why does that matter um the main
thing is that
the nut advantage is proportional to the
spr
right in a three bed pod
you can get it in with a wider range
because stacks are shorter
whereas
in a single raised pot those trips are
going to account for a lot more and more
heavily influence the seabed strategy
because by the time you get it in
there's going to be
ranges will be tighter
when stacks are wider and therefore
the nuts it trips
way more heavily
does that make sense guys yep
great
so
lastly i just want to take a look at how
fold equity applies to general cbet
trends so here we've got button versus
big blind single race pot 100 big blind
cash game
500 nl general ranges and i've grouped
them by high card so aside king heights
so on and so forth
now here's a question for you guys
why is it that we tend to prefer larger
sizes on say a jack or a 10 than we do
on an ace or a king
yeah phillip said
philip said folds out over cards
yep
yeah that's definitely something to
consider i've launched my my last poll
of the thing before i wrap this up also
like on an ace high or can i board
like i would is it is it accurate to say
that ranges are more um
like equities run closer because
uh
like
i think that was one of the the polled
um answers actually is that like there
are no more over like over pairs in the
uh
in the buttons range
that he can leverage yeah that's a great
question
um
so for example you say your your queens
and your kings they're not very happy on
an ace high board but they certainly
want to play aggressively on a lot of
say 10 hijack high boards
so i don't know if you would say ranges
run closer though
so if we take a look
at the card distribution of both ranges
keep in mind this is for a single raised
pot we can see that we actually have
the button has a huge advantage on ace
and king cards
right they have many more aces and kings
in range compared to the big blind
well that's sick
so the way i calculate these is
i just use flopzilla to calculate the
card removal and then i tally
you know what percentage of each range
contains each of these cards and i find
this useful for kind of visualizing
where the advantages lie
similarly you can do a relative
distribution so if it's higher up it's
better for the button and if it's lower
down it's better for the big blind
you might see big blind has the
advantage in all these two through seven
cards so
when the board comes all two through
seven big flight might start donking
so
anyway that's beside the point
we can see here that we actually have a
much bigger advantage on acer king yet
we're using smaller sizes we still have
an advantage on all the 10 plus cards
but
more so on acer king
and so
if we look here
the main reason is simply that
the value of fold equity is higher on a
jack or 10 high board you want to fold
out those over cards like phillip said
uh it's
your top pair is more incentivized
to bet them off of hand your over pairs
want to play more aggressively because
they don't want to see an overcard so
it's not necessarily range or nut
advantage
it's more so the dynamics of the board
itself
now if you have an acei board and you
hold top pair you're not worried about
an over card if you bet you're mostly
going to fold them off hands that you
had dominated anyway uh whereas on like
10 jack queen boards they tend to get
larger as the top pair is more
vulnerable all the stuff i've said so
anyway that's my general theory what do
you guys think
any questions
so in conclusion
fold equity is more than just how often
they fold on the spot
you have to think about what you
actually gain by generating folds
compare the incentives of betting or
raising against the incentives of
checking or calling
think about how the strength of their
bluffs or the strength of their air
influences these incentives
if the folding range is worthless then
you haven't actually gained that much
when you force those cards into the muck
when the folding range has reasonable
equity against you especially against
the value portion of your range you gain
significantly more
by folding out those hands if your
opponent's bluffs are too strong and
you'll see this often
in
an actual play people will only check
rays with strong draws you know you may
want to reconsider your calling range
perhaps you're more incentivized to
start race folding and less incentivized
to call super wide
that's a good point of the i think
the very important point is
is that
you know that people
bet with a stronger
bluff
you should not call
absolutely
absolutely so that's a that's a real
adjustment you guys can and probably
should make in-game um on draw-heavy
boards
most people are going to be using bluffs
that are too strong
they're not going to have enough trash
in range
which is going to incentivize you to
raise more and call less just to address
philip sorry philip i i looked over at
the chat i didn't see this fold out over
cards big blind trash has higher equity
on jack 10 boards
uh yes because they have all those over
cards so like a jack or a 10 high board
if you hold top pair
well you're very happy to fold out a
queen a king or an ace some people call
this cleaning up your outs but in
general
their folding range
is is gonna have more equity against you
and therefore
the value of fold equity is higher
anyway
that's my lecture guys i hope you
