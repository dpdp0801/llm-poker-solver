### TOPIC: the most misunderstood poker metric
guys we got to set the record straight now I 
make a lot of Poker math videos and as someone  
who makes a lot of Poker math videos I can 
tell you that the most misunderstood poker  
metric out there is the minimum defense 
frequency and it's such a simple concept  
at heart MDF just tells you how wide you need to 
defend to prevent your opponent from profitably  
bluffing however this simple concept is Rife 
with myths and misconceptions and we're going  
to clear those up today we'll start with some 
basic mixup so beginners will often mix up MDF  
and pot ODS one is the risk reward of bluffing 
the other relates to the risk reward of calling  
another thing people often mix up is MDF when 
facing arrays they'll just plug in the wrong  
formula but guys I've just made a video about this 
it's not what I want to cover today no I want to  
cover the myths the misconceptions if you will 
so firstly I've seen some MDA content some Mass  
data analysis type stuff that observes population 
frequencies and a lot of them will make the same  
mistake they'll look at some spot calculate MDF 
and say hey the population's folding more than  
MDF that means we can just start bluffing any 
two cards here that's not how it works you're  
probably using the wrong formula right so MDF 
is different when Bluffs have Equity another  
thing that more some wiser poker players might 
tell you is that GTO always defends less than  
MDF and I understand why people think this but 
it's not really true and I'm going to show you  
why that's the case today and finally you'll 
hear some other people say that MDF is useless  
before the river that it's like some dumb toy 
game metric that doesn't apply when Bluffs  
have equity which is like every street before 
the river but no I would argue if you believe  
this it's probably because you're using a very 
oversimplified version of the true minimum defense  
frequency let me show you what I mean let's talk 
about the pitfalls of mass data analysis now a  
lot of players track their hands and they keep 
track of population Trends and if you do this  
and You observe a large sample of hands you're 
going to notice two things right off the bat  
one is that the population seems to overfolded 
and the other is that the population seems to
overdefined guys that that's not really how 
it works so look this is not only correct  
this is GTO all right I'm going to show you 
why this is the case all right so let's say  
you're playing a 100 big blind cash game hijack 
opens big blind calls flop is doesn't matter  
I'm going to use aggregate reports anyway and 
the reason is I want the AG get Trend across  
all possible flops so we'll say that hijack 
puts in a third pot down bet and across all  
of these different flops big blind is folding 
41% of the time now question to the audience  
what is the minimum defense frequency 
take a moment to calculate your [Music]
answer if you calculated it correctly it is 75 
% so big blind should defend 75% of their range  
with a naive MDF calculation that means they 
should fold no more than 25% but that's not  
what big blind is doing big blind says nah I'm 
going to fold 40% of the time so they are way  
over falling what's going on here is big blind 
some massive knit okay well maybe we can go find  
a flop where they're defending MDF so we're going 
to sort by these things here and what's the most  
most defended flop out of all of them apparently 
it's 975 2tone and even on this one we are folding  
more than MDF says we should fold so MDF says 
fold to no more than 25% well it's folding 27.8  
so what's going on well the reason is actually 
very logical let's take a look at hijack and you  
know what we're going to pick any flop it doesn't 
matter the Flop Ace 33 pretty dry flop let's take  
a look first thing I want to do is take a look at 
strategy plus equity and then let's just sort and  
find the weakest hand in range that happens to be 
76 of diamonds so 76 of diamonds still has 21.8%  
Equity what that means is 76 can check back and 
realize some of that Equity right maybe they can  
hit a seven or a six on the turn so hijack doesn't 
have any pure Bluffs here and remember that MDF  
is designed to make your opponent indifferent 
between bluffing and checking in this case the  
EV of checking is high so with 76 the expected 
value of checking is still like I don't know  
1.66 big blinds so like if you try and over defend 
and make this hand worth zero as a bluff why would  
they ever Bluff they could just check back all of 
their weak hands take their turn equity and then  
own you with value bets right so if big blind over 
defends here if they call super wide well hijack  
has no reason to Bluff anymore so that's the first 
Pitfall if you examine any set of mass data if  
you're tracking your hand histories and you notice 
that the population seems to fold too much to a  
seabed relative to MDF well keep in mind that in a 
lot of spots they're actually supposed to be doing  
that next let's address the second misconception 
which is that population seems to over defend  
versus a flop r let's see if this is actually true 
returning to our aggregate reports let's take a  
look at how hijack responds after they put in a 
small bet and face a pot sized raise so question  
to the audience what is hijacks minimum defense 
frequency and how often should they [Music]
fold well if you've seen my poker math video 
you'll know how to calculate this big blind  
is risking nine chips nine that's the risk 
divided by risk Plus reward so if their Bluff  
is successful they'll win six chips 9 over 9 + 6 
9 over 15 means that big blind expects highjack  
def fold 60% of the time and defend 40% of the 
time but that's not what's happening is it if  
we take a look at the aggregate folding frequency 
across every flop we can see on average hijack is  
actually defending way more often than MDF would 
dictate or folding less often depending on how you  
want to look at it hijack is calling much wider in 
this case and so if you're just looking at like a  
HUD or a poker tracker and you take a look at your 
population data you might notice if you have a big  
enough sample that oh would you look at this the 
population seems to be defending too wide versus  
a check raise well time to start nut pedling 
you know but this is exactly what's supposed  
to happen let's take a look at an example why is 
this the case so here again we've selected hijack  
versus big blind same line and I've chosen a queen 
Jack eight rainbow board and here we can see that  
again hijack is way over defending relative to MDF 
only folding 50 when they should be folding 60 the  
reason for this is because Bluffs have Equity so 
let's go sort Big blind's Range facing the initial  
bet and find the worst hand so three Deuce suited 
all right so three of Spades is the worst possible  
hand we could have here but even this hand still 
has some Equity right it can still win the pot  
very rarely so imagine what happens if we put in 
this raise and hijack folds if they they defend  
exactly MDF and they fold exactly 60% of the 
time if that were the case then three Deuce of  
Spades could simply check Rays break even on the 
Rays and free roll all their turn equity and the  
same is true for every other hand that's folding 
here sure Ace 4 hey why would you fold it you got  
25% Equity might as well just Bluff phrase break 
even on that and then if you hit an ace fantastic  
that's a free roll and this is always going to 
be the case before the river MDF or the true GTO  
defending frequency facing a rays will always be 
wider than MDF simply because Bluffs have equity  
and in order to prevent those Bluffs from freeer 
rolling their Equity you need to actually defend a  
little bit wider than MDF and so this is where the 
other assumption the other myth if you will that  
GTO always folds less than MDF is just wrong there 
are plenty of spots in fact any spot facing arrays  
where the optimal strategy is to defend much wider 
than MDF now I'm going to switch over to the GTO  
wizard complex reports now the complex reports 
are great for my purpose because they essentially  
show uh how big blind will respond against a huge 
different range of bet sizes and this is perfect  
for what I'm looking for now if you want to go 
and take a look at the complex reports you'll  
need to activate it in settings these are hidden 
under Legacy settings they're an older version  
of our Solutions noway we generally use the 
simpler or general Solutions but complex are  
still here for this purpose so if I graph how big 
blind will respond or the average response across  
all of these flops and then I do that against all 
these different bet sizes I can create a graph so  
let's compare big blind's actual folding frequency 
against what 1us MDF would say they should fold as  
you can see the big blind almost always folds more 
than Alpha things it should and so this blue line  
This represents the GTO folding frequency against 
different bet sizes on the x-axis and the folding  
frequency on the y axis and so I've graphed this 
against the alpha folding frequency recall Alpha  
is just one minus MDF so how often we think they 
ought to fold using our naive MDF calculation uh  
and we can see that GTO is always folding more 
often right and it doesn't matter how big the  
bat size is or what the Flop is this is just 
the math of game three optimal poker but let's  
switch over to a different spot now take a look 
at how big blind responds against a small blind  
cat so in this case the difference is that the big 
blind has position and position counts for a lot  
and as you can see when big blind is in position 
they are defending almost exactly at MDF and so  
what this means is that you should overfolded to 
MDF out of position and you should defend almost  
exactly at MDF in position if your goal is to 
play a game theory optimal strategy all right  
so the main three Trends to know are that GTO 
overfalls to a CET out of position GTO defends  
at MDF in position and GTO over defends versus AR 
raay from almost all positions chapter 2 the math  
of true MDF the expected value of a pure Bluff 
is pretty straightforward it's just how often  
they fold times the pot minus how often they call 
times your bet and you can graph this it's just a  
straight line graph right so for a 200% pot sized 
bet the alpha is 66 meaning MDF is one minus this  
number 34% and if they fold more than this well 
hey we're in the green zone we're making money and  
if they fold less than this we're in the red zone 
and we're losing money well the important thing to  
take away just from MDF calculations regardless 
is that if you change your bet size it changes  
your risk reward ratio so for a 2/3 pot sized 
bet well we only need them to fold 40% of the  
time before we break even anything above this so 
if they're folding more often we make money less  
often we lose money so it's a very straightforward 
calculation but fact is that Bluffs have equity  
and if you can understand that basic EV equation 
I've shown you earlier you'll understand this  
next part so when Bluffs have Equity we need to 
alter the expected value equation and update our  
assumptions about how things work let's compare 
naive MDF on the left versus true MDF on the right  
so naive MDF always assumes that Bluffs will 
always lose if your opponent calls or raises  
conversely true MDF understands that your Bluffs 
can still have Equity When Calls there's such a  
thing as a semi Bluff naive MDF assumes that when 
you check with a bluff you always lose it's just  
zero whereas true MDF understands that checking 
weak hands isn't the same thing as giving up with  
them those hands can still have value naive MDF 
assumes that the only way to win is by forcing  
a fold right now whereas true MDF understands 
that you can Bluff again on later streets and  
so that leads to the conclusion naive MDF tries 
to make the value of a bluff equals zero whereas  
true MDF tries to make the value of a bluff the 
same as checking that bluff so EV bets equals EV  
check and these are two different equations let 
me give you an example let's say that you're on  
the river and you have some weak hand that has 
a bit of equity checking behind so let's say  
you have some pocket pair you're still ahead of 
some portion of your opponent's range but you're  
contemplating whether or not to turn this hand 
into a bluff how much fold Equity do you need  
in order for this Bluff to be good in order for it 
to be better than checking [Music] behind [Music]
well we'll assume you have 25% Equity as a check 
therefore if we put in a half pot riverb we need  
to make the expected value of bluffing equal the 
expected value of checking and the reason we do  
this is to find that break even point so we want 
at least this much preferably more F Equity so  
25% pot is equal to how often they fold times the 
pot subtract how often they call time your half  
pot bet replacing the variables full percentage 
can be written as a function of call percentage  
and the BET can be written as 0.5 relative 
to the pot of one this leaves us with one  
variable easy to solve using some simple algebra 
just rearrange to find that the optimal calling  
and folding percentage is 50% now comparing this 
to naive MDF naive MDF would just blankly assume  
that your hand is worthless as a check therefore 
you only need them to fold a third of the time  
in order for turning it into a bluff to be good 
true MDF understands that your hand has value as  
a check and therefore you need more fold equity in 
order to justify turning it into a bluff right and  
so instead of needing 33% now we need 50% the 
true MDF formula compares the expected value  
of checking against betting in the expected value 
of betting previously we've assumed that when you  
get called your hand is dead but the true formula 
understands that hey you know what you could be  
semi- bluffing you could have value even if you're 
called or even if you face arrays so for my next  
example I'm going to show you how this works with 
a visual rather than just typing formulas at you  
so for this example we're going to simplify this 
equation a bit and remove the raise term so we'll  
only look at the expected value of betting versus 
checking in a situation when your opponent will  
either fold or call here's a graph I've built that 
shows on the x-axis your expected value in called  
and on the y- AIS how much fold Equity you need 
in order for betting to be better than checking  
and so we can confirm this for let's say a weekend 
so right here I have it at minus one indicating a  
pot sized bet with a pure Bluff EV when called 
is minus one therefore you need your opponent  
to fold half the time 0.5 let's say you put in 
a half pot bent EV when called is negative 0.5  
meaning when you get called you lose your half 
pot bet and you need them to fold a third of the  
time time now watch what happens if I increase 
the expected value of checking let's say that  
checking is now equal to 25% of the pot so you 
expect to win a quarter of the pot on average  
when you check that's what raising and lowering 
this means so checking EV 0.25 now all of a sudden  
well we need a lot more fold Equity right so this 
assumes that if we get called we lose our half  
pot bet but we could imagine that maybe we're 
semi bluffing and maybe we win a little bit of  
the time even when we get called and in that 
case we don't need quite as much fold Equity  
the basic concept to take away from this graph 
and here I'll change it back to a POS siiz bet  
is that as you increase the value of checking you 
need more and more fold Equity to justify betting  
rather than checking and similarly if your hand 
has more value when called so for example we can  
assume you're putting in a pot sized bet but 
you have some semi Bluff that has still like  
a decent amount of EV when called well now now all 
of a sudden we can see that we don't need as much  
fold Equity if our hand retains value when called 
now the one thing you might be asking yourself is  
what is this section down here this is above 
zero well these are your value bets these are  
hands that are ahead when called so positive EV 
when called means that you are ahead but checking  
might still be better right just because your 
head when called doesn't necessarily mean that  
your EV is higher right so for example let's say 
that you have a hand that's uh just very slightly  
ahead when called we'll say 0.1 meaning basically 
Break Even but very slightly better than one what  
this means is that we need at least 24% fold 
Equity if our opponent is folding less often  
than this well then checking behind with that 
value hand may still be appropriate and so you  
can use this simple model to kind of figure out 
how the EV of checking and betting works either  
for a bluff or even for like a thin value bet like 
this it's all the same math at the end of the day  
if you want to play around around with this graph 
I've put a link in the description of this video  
uh there's a bunch of formulas and stuff in here 
but essentially you can control either of these  
either just by clicking and dragging or by using 
these sliders while I was making this video it  
occurs to me that actually going and looking up 
the folding frequencies for different Ray sizes  
in different spots is kind of a pain and also 
plugging in all the EV calculations is also a  
pain so I wanted to see if I could find like a 
nice quick approximation of how often the GTO  
Strat will fold facing arrays in different spots 
and of course it's depends on the spot but we can  
find a nice rough approximation and that is the 
GTO fold percentage is approximately equal to  
the Pod ODS of the Rays multiplied by the Golden 
Ratio the golden ratio is a mathematical constant  
that seems to pop up uh all over math and physics 
I don't know why this correlation exists but it  
just kind of seems to work this approximation 
will usually get you to within about 2 3% of  
the true folding frequency so let me show you 
an example let's say you bet third pod on the  
button and you face a half pod raise what is the 
Pod odds laid for half pod raise well I have this  
memorized but I can also see it's about 25% it 
is exactly 25% excuse me so .25 time the golden  
ratio which is 1.618 ETC I estimate that the 
true folding frequency is about 40% and here we  
can see it's 38.3% so you know within 2% we'll 
try it for a full pot raise and again pod odds  
for full pod rise are 33.3 this is convenient 
because I already have my pod odds memorized as  
every good poker player should multiplied by 1.618 
and that's going to give me an estimate of about  
53 call that 54% which is within half a percent of 
the true folding frequency I don't I know why this  
correlation exists re realistically you could just 
round it to like 1.6 or 1.7 and get a pretty good  
estimate there is some math that connects like MDF 
and pod ODS actually intersect at the golden ratio  
if you graph it by bet size but I'm not sure if 
that's why this is happening it's probably just  
coincidence that this approximation seems to work 
well regardless if you're just looking for a quick  
estimate at how often your opponents are supposed 
to be folding versus some Ray size that one will  
get you reasonably close let's summarize what 
we've learned today so the biggest takeaway for  
you is that there is a big difference between 
naive MDF and true MDF because Bluffs can have  
value a bluff is not always going to be worthless 
and therefore the defense against a bluff or how  
often you should defend is going to be a function 
of the expected value of betting and checking  
you need more folds when checking is valuable 
so if you're considering turning a maid hand  
into a bluff you need them to fold more often in 
order order for that to be uh a viable strategy  
conversely you need fewer folds when drawing so 
a draw doesn't need as much fold equity in order  
for betting to be better than checking but at 
the same time a draw often has value checking  
back as well keeping your opponent's range wide 
etc etc the key trends when analyzing how GTO  
responds is that GTO tends to overfall to a 
cat out of position especially on the Flop uh  
GTO tends to defend at MDF in position and GTO 
over defends versus arrays in all positions in  
all spots before the river now I understand that 
this was more of a complex topic I usually try  
and leave these for the private coachings but I 
figured the YouTube audience would like it as well  
if you need something clarified feel free to ask
