### TOPIC: the science of hero calling in poker
there's no better feeling in poker than calling 
the river with a below average hand and watching  
your opponent reluctantly turn over a bluff 
players who are able to make sick River calls  
in big spots often seem like they know exactly 
what hand their opponent has but is it really  
all about reading another player's Soul or 
is there some signs behind it let's find
out first let's establish exactly what we mean 
by Hero calling since it's a bit of a vague term  
and being specific is always helpful we're 
only going to be using the term to refer to  
River spots since that's what most people think of 
when it comes to this concept and Bluff catching  
on the earlier streets is a much more complex 
topic anyway every river spot where one player  
has a somewhat polarized range and the other has a 
more condensed range is going to feature a certain  
amount of bluff catching by the non-polarized 
player for theoretical reasons I'll explain  
in a moment many of the bluff catching hands in 
these spots are going to have approximately zero  
EV as Bluff catchers they're going to be mixing 
calls and folds at equilibrium because the EVS  
of folding and calling are the same calling with 
these hands is very reasonable in many spots and  
there are plenty of circumstances where even a 
slight tendency to over Bluff on the part of our  
opponent can lead us to always call with these 
hands however this isn't a massive adaptation  
away from equilibrium so it doesn't really 
meet the definition of hero calling instead  
we're going to focus on the spots where we might 
consider calling with a hand which is actually a  
pure fold at equilibrium one which has such 
poor or card removal properties that it's  
usually supposed to be a snap fold but instead 
we're going to peer into our opponent's Soul  
call the river and win at showdown in order 
to figure out how to Hero call profitably we  
need to have a solid understanding of the theory 
behind Bluff catching so let's dig into that a  
little bit some of these Concepts may already be 
familiar to you but even if so it's always good  
to be reminded of how it works in theoretically 
correct or GTO poker we're supposed to be Bluff  
catching every river spot a given percentage of 
the time based on villain's bet size in order to  
to stop them from being able to profitably Bluff 
with any two cards this hypothetical frequency is  
often referred to as minimum defense frequency or 
MDF for short also in theory villain is supposed  
to Bluff the river at a certain rate as well the 
percentage of Bluffs in their range should equal  
the pot odds they're offering us on a call so 
that we have enough incentive to pay them off  
when they have a value hand in turn the hands we 
call with need to have above a certain percentage  
of equity at Showdown so that we actually win the 
part when villain is bluffing obviously we don't  
want to call the river with hands which lose to 
villains Bluffs because that turns their Bluffs  
into value bets and changes the whole equation so 
overall what's theoretically supposed to happen  
is that our opponent's Bluffs and our Bluff 
catchers all break even while our opponent's  
value bets profit significantly and our Bluff 
catchers also make money when our opponent gives  
up on a bluff and surrenders the pot which of 
course is supposed to happen sometimes as well  
next let's start to move away from Theory and 
into the exploitative realm this is where hero  
calling starts to become a consideration in 
practice our opponents will sometimes end up  
over bluffing in other words the percentage of 
Bluffs in their range is greater than the pot  
odds they're offering us on a call this turns 
all of our zeroe Bluff catches into profitable  
calls if we call with these hands which we 
should if we think villain is over bluffing  
then we're essentially ignoring the principles 
of MDF and calling too much because villain is  
offering us an opportunity to make far more 
money than we should theoretically be making  
because the margins here are very narrow and the 
frequency a player is bluffing in theory will be  
very precisely determined according to the exact 
bet size B being used these adaptations become  
very binary in nature if they over Bluff we're 
now incentivized to call with every hand which  
beats their Bluffs while if they were under 
bluffing which we'll talk about in our next  
video we would be incentivized to fold all these 
hands hypothetically our opponent could exploit  
these adaptations on our part in future Hands 
by simply never bluffing against us and allowing  
their value hands to make a massive amount of 
profit by getting called more often however in  
most cases if we're making an exploitative 
adaptation by deciding to Hero call against  
a particular opponent we're usually doing it 
without any fear of what might happen in future  
hands since it's very rare that an opponent 
who exhibits a significant weakness in their  
bluffing frequencies will also be capable of 
accurately adapting to counter the ways that  
we're exploiting them so this is how hero calling 
works it requires us to identify a spot where we  
believe our opponent to be over bluffing or in 
other words where we believe the percentage of  
Bluffs in their range outweighs the pot odds that 
bet is offering us but in order to apply this  
concept in a practical way we need to think about 
the types of spots in which these opportunities  
might come up and to help us do this I've divided 
potential hero call spots into two categories both  
of which are surprisingly common in practice even 
though they're not necessarily easy to identify  
the first category is spots where our opponent 
arrives at the river with a lot of potential  
Bluff candidates in their range and simply never 
shuts down their Bluffs by checking back their  
range might be somewhat well constructed leading 
up to that point but once they get to the river  
they can't resist the urge to fire the third 
Barrel this might be because they expect us to
overfolded on previous streets and therefore 
arrives at the river with too many Bluff  
candidates to begin with and then also fails to 
shut down this can lead to spots where villain is  
over bluffing by a significant margin but it is 
somewhat less common overall the second category  
is spots where our opponent arrives at the river 
with the appropriate bluffing candidates and does  
choose their Bluffs effectively but for whatever 
reason doesn't value bet thinly enough with  
certain types of hands this leads to the absolute 
number of Bluffs in their range staying the same  
while their value bets decrease which increases 
the overall ratio of Bluffs to Value bets in  
their range and pushes them above the optimal 
bluffing frequency for the situation and into  
over bluffing [Music] territory both of these 
types of spots are ones where hero calling can  
sometimes be incentivized so let's take a look at 
a couple of examples in GTO wizard AI to see how  
it works first we'll take a look at what we'll 
call a type one one spot where villain arrives  
at the river with a lot of potential Bluffs and 
never shuts down so this is the unlocked version  
of our spot here you can see it's a 100 big blind 
MTT spot hijack big blind 1095 two diamonds flop  
Hick's going to bet 2/3 part and get called then 
on the four of Spade's turn they're going to bet a  
geometric overb size of about 1.4x pot we're going 
to get a blank River the four clubs and big blind  
checks to them and hijack is going to jam you can 
see hijacks jamming range here on river is very  
polar obviously we've got a value region right up 
here all over Pairs and you can see mostly King 10  
plus king 10 is roughly right around the threshold 
where the value betting range stops and then the  
Bluffs are coming primarily from the King High and 
no madean region but a little bit of ace high in  
there as well even though ace high does have some 
Showdown value it's going to be little bits of  
stuff like Ace six over here little tiny shreds 
of Ace King and things like that but generally  
a fairly logical strategy and the majority of the 
Bluffs are going to come from this area over here  
as you can see as well as a lot of the king queens 
and King jacks up there so if we look at the bluff  
catches that the big blind is employing you can 
see that the portion of range that's going to be  
indifferent here which is going to be the portion 
that's mixing calls and folds is right around this  
top pair and second pair area as you can tell King 
10 Queen 10 Jack 10 these are all the hands that  
are beating all the Bluffs but are losing to 
most of the value bets so this stuff is going  
to be very very close to break even the weaker 
10x is going to be the same thing it's going to  
be very close 105 actually has two pair there so 
it beats Ace 10 and King 10 so that's actually a  
pure Bluff catcher and then 10 three and 10 Deuce 
those hands are calling because they actually were  
having a dece or three in their hand they unblock 
every potential Bluff whereas all of this stuff  
up here blocks at least some chunk of Bluffs so 
that's the bluff catching protocol here we're  
never calling with a nine except for specifically 
mixing ace9 of hearts and ace9 of clubs and then  
a little bit of A9 offit there but generally 
we're not calling especially wide we're not  
really going too far beyond a 10 and even a lot of 
our 10x is actually folding here now if we look at  
the locked version of this that I have prepared 
we've got a very similar setup here of the value  
bet and Bluff ranges for the in position villain 
here for the hijack everything King 10 plus is  
going to be value betting just for Simplicity 
we've got 10 n nines 10 in there we've got the  
pocket fives fours 54 Etc all the 4X all the over 
pairs up here very straightforward and then the  
bluffing region is going to be purely this noade 
hand and King High so we've got everything that  
is bluffing is being drawn directly from this 
portion of hands here this portion up here and  
then a little bit of this stuff down here and 
we've got villain following through with all of  
of this stuff so they are basically not giving 
up their King highs and queen highs very often  
they're bluffing all of this stuff in full when 
they get here and let's see what effect that has  
on the bluff catching protocols here it is here 
is the out ofos strategy for the big blind take  
a look at this right the big blind is never 
actually folding even ace high and these hands  
that were pure folds before have now become pure 
calls there's nothing that's mixing everything  
that beats Bluffs is purely calling even stuff 
like 5 re off suit all the weak hands and better  
everything in all of these categories is purely 
going to call there's no real need to worry about  
card removal or anything like that and if we look 
at the EV margins I have it set in percentage of  
the pot here and we look at what kind of pot share 
something like a king9 is making king9 is making  
about 133% of the pot here so in a pretty big pot 
you know 200 big blind pot making 133% of the pot  
it's about 26 big blinds that's very very good 
in terms of a profit margin so as a whole here  
we can really expect that these hands are doing 
extremely well and we're going to make a lot of  
money by snapping our opponent off with these 
hands because they're drastically over bluffing  
so as a whole every single hand that beats Bluff 
catchers is calling and you can see we're only  
folding 8% of the time and it's because we have 
hands that just don't beat any of the Bluffs at  
all so to summarize this spot in this scenario 
villain was value betting all 10 plus which was  
pretty good however they're supposed to shut down 
with a good number of Miss draws which are mostly  
going to be diamonds and Spades while their hearts 
and clubs continue bluffing in our locked version  
they were Bing the river with 114 combinations 
of hands overall with around 50 of those being  
Bluffs that means that they're actually bluffing 
about 44% of the time here on the river however  
we only need 37% Equity to call because we're 
getting 1.73 to one pot odds so obviously any one  
pair is going to have much more Equity than this 
it's going to have that 44% Equity at least so we  
should always call with every Bluff catcher here 
even the ones that are pure folds at equilibrium  
there's no reason to ever fold any of them 
when villain is over bluffing by this kind of a
margin next let's look at what I'm going to 
call a type two spot where the villain isn't  
value betting thinly enough so our example in 
this case is going to be a very similar spot  
we've got a 1095 flop once again same bet size 
same formation same Stacks this time the turn  
is the seven of clubs and the in position player 
is going to bet 2/3 pot again river is the six of  
Hearts goes Check and in position has a pot siiz 
bet or a check so as you can see their strategy  
here is going to involve value betting pretty 
much all their two pairs plus even a tiny shred  
of over pairs there and then their Bluffs are 
going to come from some variation of low pair  
ace high King High and and worse so we've got 
a whole bunch of different potential bluffing  
candidates here primarily if we sort out the trash 
hands you can see it's going to be pocket fours  
and Below we've got some ACE for and Below some 
King for and below and then we've even got little  
bits of Ace king king queen queen Jack and some of 
this stuff around here so a certain number of kind  
of Broadway region Bluffs up there so a variety 
of different Bluffs but crucially we've got all  
of that two pair plus except for a tiny bit of 
pocket 10 because it blocks top pair blocks two  
pair that all these hands are going to be value 
betting at a pretty high rate now if we look at  
what the outer position response is going to be 
here you can see that the hands that are Break  
Even or the hands that are Bluff catching here are 
primarily going to be the top pair region a little  
bit of third pair even some 7x that unblocks 
some Bluffs but really the primary Break Even  
region or Bluff catching region is going to be 
everything up here and everything across here  
it's the 10x and then a little bit of this stuff 
down here although because once again the 103 and  
10 D unblock all the Bluffs they actually pure 
call but generally we're looking at a 10 with  
a Broadway kicker as being the break even region 
against this pot size River bet here so let's now  
shift over to an exploitative version of this sim 
a locked version where we change villain's value  
bet region so in this locked version of The Sim I 
have restricted villain to only value betting with  
their Straits as you can see right here they're 
not betting their sets in two pairs anymore in  
this region here they're actually checking back 
everything that is between third pair and a set  
and then they're going to continue bluffing with 
this low pair ace high King High noade hand region  
so they're actually going to continue with all 
their Bluffs at the right rates but they're going  
to reduce their value betting frequency and if we 
take a look at what the out- of position player  
is doing you'll see that once again we're now in 
the territory where we're calling 96% of the time  
in fact we have almost no jams there's zero combos 
of jams here because we simply don't have anything  
that can actually Jam for Value we don't really 
have Jack eight in our range anymore because of  
how we played the turn so in the end everything 
here is actually Bluff catching and the only hand  
that's folding is Queen Jack it looks like so 
really we're back to this territory where we're  
Bluff catching everything and that means we're 
even Bluff catching regions like low pair we're  
Bluff catching a five here on this River we're 
Bluff catching with Jack five King five Queen five  
all of that stuff a six so something like six4 of 
diamonds all of these hands if we reduce villain's  
value bet range by taking out all of that two 
pair and set material if we take out all of this  
here these value bets suddenly villain is now over 
bluffing because they're finding the right Bluffs  
but they're not finding all the right value bets 
and that's why we end up hero calling with all  
of these hands so to summarize this spot villain 
was failing to go for thin value with their sets  
and their two pairs but they are still finding 
some Bluffs with hands worse than ace high in  
total they end up betting River with only around 
40 two combos of hands but 19 of those combos are  
bluffs which means they're bluffing around 46% 
of the time since their bet size is exactly pot  
we're getting exactly two to one pot odds which 
means we only need around 33% Equity to call and  
with the equity our Bluff catchers have we're way 
above that threshold so we're once again calling  
with any hand which beats the Bluffs so that's 
it for this breakdown of the principles behind  
hero calling hopefully you can implement this in 
your game and find some good spots to Soul read
