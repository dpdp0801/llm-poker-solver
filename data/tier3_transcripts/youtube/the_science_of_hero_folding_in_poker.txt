### TOPIC: the science of hero folding in poker
folding big hands isn't necessarily the most 
exciting part of Poker but the ability to  
make the right folds at the right times 
can contribute significantly to your win  
rate but how do we go about figuring out the 
best times to make a hero fold in this video  
we're going to break down the topic 
and give you a blueprint let's dive
in hi Wizards I'm Matt hunt and today we're 
going to discuss the prospect of hero folding  
as a follow-up to my last video here on the 
channel where we talked about hero calling  
if you haven't yet checked out that video I'd 
recommend going back to it before you watch  
this one but for anyone who hasn't seen it we'll 
do a quick review of the theoretical principles  
behind Bluff catching and how they might apply 
to this topic but first we'll establish our  
definition for what hero folding really is we're 
only going to be looking at River spots since  
those are the spots where hero folds are most 
feasible and because we're quite often dealing  
with Bluff catching scenarios where many hands 
have approximately zero EV as Bluff catchers  
these hands are going to mix calls and folds at 
equilibrium but even if we fold with one of these  
hands in pure we're not deviating that much but 
for the purposes of this discussion we're going  
to focus on the times where we decide to fold 
with a hand which would ordinarily be a pure  
call at equilibrium so in other words we're really 
not giving our opponent credit for being able to  
find enough Bluffs to recap the theory behind 
these spots we're supposed to call any riverb  
in a bluff catching spot a certain percentage of 
the time in order to ensure that villains Bluffs  
Break Even or at least that the EV of bluffing 
is the same as the EV of checking and giving up  
as usual we're focused on keeping our opponent 
indifferent between options as much as possible  
they're supposed to be bluffing at a certain 
frequency in order to ensure that we can't  
hero fold with any of our best Bluff catchers if 
they never bluffed we would only call with hands  
which beat enough of their value bets because 
we only need to call with a given hand if it's  
going to have enough equity at Showdown to win 
a certain percentage of the time in practice  
many scenarios will play out differently from what 
theory suggests obviously and this is particularly  
true in live poker where behavioral reads and 
game Dynamics can significantly influence over  
all bluffing frequencies some players will end 
up under bluffing for one reason or another in  
a given spot which makes Bluff catching on our 
part a very negative EV proposition if we choose  
not to Bluff catch we're ignoring the principles 
of minimum defense frequency and choosing to fold  
too much and we're doing it in a very binary 
way we're folding all of our Bluff catches if  
we think we're no longer getting the right 
price hypothetically villain could exploit  
this in future by always bluffing and never value 
betting thinly but obviously if we're considering  
hero folding we're probably doing it against 
an opponent who we don't believe is capable of  
adjusting appropriately in future hands just 
like with hero calling there are two primary  
types of spots in which we'll find ourselves with 
potential opportunities to Hero fold the first is  
when the board texture Runs Out in such a way 
where it interacts with almost all the hands  
in villains range in some way leaving them with 
very few obvious bluffing candidates this will  
force them to aggressively search for available 
Bluffs and potentially turn certain hands which  
do possess some Showdown value into Bluffs which 
is generally a lot more difficult to pull the  
trigger on than than simply checking and hoping 
to have the best hand the second category is where  
villain does have a good number of identifiable 
bluffing candidates but simply decides not to  
Bluff with them on the river either because 
they just can't bring themselves to pull the  
trigger or because they don't expect us to fold 
often enough this can sometimes occur on unique  
River runouts Where the River card interacts 
with almost all hands in our own range or it  
can simply occur because of game Dynamic such 
as if this particular player has been bluffing  
a lot against us recently and they've decided 
they don't think we're going to keep folding
so now that we've established 
the parameters of these spots  
let's open GTO Wizard and use GTO 
wizard AI to explore a couple of
examples so this is the example spot we're going 
to be looking at for this particular case we've  
got a 100 big blind MTT scenario with hijack 
versus big blind formation and we've got a 1095  
two diamonds flop with the in position player 
in the hijack betting 2/3 of pot the big blind  
calling the turn is the eight of spades the hijack 
is going to go ahead and bet full pot get called  
and then the river is going to come the jack of 
diamonds which obviously puts not only three to  
a flush out there but also four to a straight as 
well so very tricky run out Big Bun is going to  
check their whole range there was some leading 
here in the original version of this Sim but I  
eliminated the lead here just because I wanted to 
make sure that we were looking at this as a pure  
Bluff catching spot and if we look at villain's 
strategy here they're basically only really able  
to Value bet with the flush and the straight flush 
at this point and a tiny bit of some straights  
it's going to be a straight with a diamond is 
going to bet at some rate there like pocket Queens  
with a diamond that is the only region they're 
able to really value bet but they are able to of  
course find some Bluffs and their main Bluffs here 
are going to be coming from the low pair and the  
King High region not really the ace high region 
you can see if we highlight trash hands here the  
pocket fors and below are by far the most frequent 
Bluffs just those pure unblockers here we've got a  
little bit of ace8 off we've got a little bit 
of King six suited but really not a lot going  
on there in the way of bluffing candidates with 
the ace highs and things like that those hands  
just either already have a pair that they just 
rivered or they just are not going to be doing  
very well in terms of blocking power and if we 
shift to looking at the big blind's response here  
you can see that they're Bluff catching a fair 
amount about 40% of the time and then they're  
also jamming 10% of the time looks like with most 
ly their flushes but not all their flushes just  
the strongest ones and you can see that the 
straights are actually partially folding here  
if we highlight this straight category the stuff 
that has just the seven that stuff is folding so  
that's pretty close but it is more or less going 
to be more in the fold category we've also got a  
lot of other categories that are breaking even 
everything from third pair upwards is actually  
mixing at least some calls and this is all just 
because of card REM removal we've got a lot of  
different hands like King n here King n of Spades 
is pure call Simply be because it blocks king  
queen it unblocks certain other Bluff candidates 
it unblocks all the low cards but then we've got  
a lot of other stuff like for example the ace 
Jack Ace Jack of Spades is pure fold so card  
removal is going to have a really big impact here 
and you can see that the bluff catching protocols  
for the big blind are not particularly clear now 
if you look at RL alternative Sim what I've done  
here is I've actually locked villains turn betting 
range so I've had them betting a very draw heavy  
turn range you can see that their drawers are all 
betting at a pretty high rate here flush drawers  
open Enders the stuff that has a pair is mostly 
checking but then you can see a lot of the diamond  
Spades a lot of the Sixx a lot of The Jacka 7x 
Queen X all of these gut shots these drawing type  
hands those are going to be betting the turn at a 
pretty high rate in this version of The Sim and I  
think that's actually not too dissimilar from how 
a lot of players actually play so when they bet  
this turn with a very draw heavy range and then we 
call and then we get this jack of diamonds River  
it's a river card that now forces them to pretty 
aggressively try to find the Bluffs and part of  
the issue here is that even though villain was 
not supposed to Value bet their Straits previously  
it's actually fairly likely that they might do 
that they might find even more value bets than  
what they're theoretically supposed to because 
they are just going to have a higher ratio of  
hands that are looking to complete that draw 
and when they get there they may not want to  
check so let's say that they do actually bet all 
of their straights and better on the river even  
though the Straits were actually checking back a 
lot previously and then let's say they Bluff with  
all their Ace highs and King Highs but they're 
not bluffing with pairs they're not bluffing  
with top pair they're not arriving here with the 
low pocket pair region which is quite important  
here so they're not really going to have too many 
candidates to choose from here even if they Bluff  
their Ace and King High every single time and 
if that's the case look at what the big blind's  
response is we're obviously raising with flushes 
and straight flushes because now villain's value  
bet range includes all those Straits but our 
Straits with the queen are just calling and  
then everything else those Straits with the 
seven those sets those two pairs those top  
pairs all that stuff that was previously mixing 
calls is purely folding now with the exception  
of some of it that chooses to turn into a bluff 
so some of the specific combos here that block  
maybe some of the bottom two pairs that block the 
straight combos those are choosing to turn into  
Bluffs here for a fairly cheap price actually 
for a fairly small raise but generally speaking  
there's almost no Bluff catching actually going 
on here there's very very few hands if we hit  
call it's really only the queen X and even some of 
that is not appearing in the range very frequently  
so it's Queen 10 Queen five suited that's about 
it so that's a very good example of where we're  
making some pretty big hero folds we're actually 
folding the seven quite often and we're really not  
calling with any of those Bluff catchers at all so 
to summarize our type one spot here where villain  
does not have enough Bluff candidates in this 
case we saw that on this board texture villain  
was really only barreling the turn with a lot of 
value hands and strong High Equity drawers which  
were mostly completed on the jack of diamonds 
River so that left them with very very few good  
bluffing candidates when we check to them in this 
case their River betting range consisted of around  
50 combos overall with their value range being 
any straight flush or straight flush whereas their  
Bluffs however are only seven combos of missed 
Spade draws specifically the ones which don't have  
a pair and that equates to only a 14% bluffing 
frequency here which given that we're getting two  
to one odds and we need 33% Equity to call isn't 
anywhere close to allowing us to profitably Bluff  
catch in fact even the low end of the straight 
with a hand like 107 isn't enough for us to call  
because we still lose to all the value and we 
still don't beat enough Bluffs we're only calling  
the river with the queen High straight in this 
instance our flushes have to raise for value and  
we're also raising some Bluffs as well obviously 
so take a note that just because we don't have  
much incentive to Bluff catch doesn't mean we 
can't attempt to Bluff here ourselves we might  
be able to get villain to bet fold a straight 
without a diamond here for example that is worth
considering next let's look at our second type of  
example where villain simply shuts 
down too often when check two on the
river so for this spot we are going to look once 
again at this 1095 two diamonds flop as we did  
earlier in this video with the same bet size 
on the Flop this 2/3 pot right here big blind  
calls turn is now going to be a four of Spades 
the hijack is going to use a geometric sizing  
here which is a 1.4x or so overb they get called 
and in the river is a four which is a complete  
brick doesn't really change much about the board 
at all and you can see they're also basically  
using a pure Allin check strategy and their value 
bet region is more or less going to consist of  
these categories here everything King 10 plus 
approximately depending on the exact combo of  
King 10 and then we've also got a lot of Bluffs 
coming in with King High and in particular also  
a tiny bit of some ace high and a lot of their 
Queen highs Jack highs and really anything King  
high or worse is bluffing at a decent frequency 
here so that's how they're constructed equilibrium  
here and now let's take a look at the locked 
version villain arrives in this spot with the  
same range so we're not changing anything prior 
to the river but what we've done is we've kept  
this value bet range the same we've kept it at 
the same frequency approximately with all that  
King 10 plus going for Value here and then we've 
had them only bluffing with noade hand so that  
means their ace high and King high is checking 
back it means that all this ace high stuff and  
King High stuff that was mixing Bluffs before is 
now checking back and instead they're just purely  
bluffing when they get there with Queen high or 
worse so Queen Jack Queen 8 Queen 7 Etc all that  
sort of thing and if we look at the response from 
this version of the strategy take a look at how  
much calling we're doing we are calling with top 
p still at some rate and we're calling with all of  
our over pairs plus but we're no longer doing 
any real Bluff catching at all we're actually  
pretty much mixing with the hand that corresponds 
with the bottom of villain's value bet range so  
villain is value betting King 10 sometimes so 
our King 10 is also going to mix but everything  
worse than that is now folding some of these 
hands like 103 tendu that were calling because  
they were unblocking every single Bluff those 
are now pure folding and so on and so forth so  
we have no incentive to do any hero calling here 
we're only calling with stuff that actually beats  
the villain's value bet range so in this spot 
villain is arriving at the river with a fairly  
well-rounded range because we haven't locked their 
strategy on any earlier Street however instead of  
bluffing some of their King High and ace high 
hands with the right blocking properties while  
giving up some of their Queen high and Jack High 
they're actually giving up with all their King  
highs and Ace highs and always jamming the river 
whenever they have Queen high or Worse they're  
also continuing to Value bet with their King 10 
and better which is important since it signifies  
that they're not slowing down with their value 
they're actually value betting very slightly  
thinner than they're supposed to since King 10 
is checking behind at some rate at equilibrium  
in this case villain is betting River with around 
87 combos of hands while only 23 of those combos  
are bluffs a frequency of around 26% since we're 
getting 1.73 to1 pot odds against this overb we  
need about 37% equity in order to Bluff catch 
and we're around 11% short of that Mark for  
this reason only ace 10 and better is calling 
this River Jam in pure since Ace 10 beats King  
10 it wins much more than 26% of the time and as 
a general rule of thumb if you beat some of your  
opponent's value bets your hand is almost always 
strong enough to call the river King 10 in this  
case only chops with the bottom of our opponent's 
value range so it's going to be pretty close to  
break even if not losing in some instances so 
those are the two types of spots in which you  
might be able to find some good opportunities to 
make some hero Folds but if you are going to make  
these folds be careful not to let your opponents 
know that you're doing it these plays are highly  
exploitable by stronger players so you don't 
want to show your hand and let your opponents  
know you're making a big fold that's it for this 
video I'll be back soon with more content here  
on YouTube in the meantime feel free to reach 
out on Discord if you have questions about this  
video or any of my other content and until 
next time good luck everyone and thanks for
