### TOPIC: the secret to crushing deep-stacked poker games
[Music]
the thing about playing deep is that once 
you get past the 2 to 300 big blind mark  
it almost becomes a different game altogether 
and if you continue using the same strategies  
it could potentially cost you a ton of money so 
what I've prepared today are four tips that you  
want to keep in mind when playing deep these tips 
are relatively simple quite easy to implement and  
most importantly this should have an immediate 
impact on your win rate and make sure you stay  
till the again because the last one makes 
you an absolute nightmare to play [Music]
against so without further Ado let's jump right 
into the first tip which is to three that bigger  
when you're in position so if you are 100 big 
blind s it's pretty standard to three back to  
around three times the open right but once you get 
to two or you know past two or 300 big planes you  
actually want to make it a little bit larger so 
if you're especially deep you know like 300 500  
pick lines you can even easily make it four times 
off the open to understand the logic behind this  
we first need to think about the reason why 
we are we are not allowed to do this at 100  
big lines and the the main problem with this is 
that your opponent can actually start shifting  
his strategy towards forbet or F and once out of 
position start shifting his strategy in this way  
right at a certain point you're going to through b 
so big that out of position will start ply playing  
for bat or F and that actually defeats the whole 
purpose of three Bing Big like so that's kind of  
why we forc to make it a little bit smaller at 
100 big blindes right whereas uh once you get up  
to two or 300 big blindes you know that there's 
actually a limit to how much out of position  
can for B right so uh that in turn allows us to 
increase our Prat size without getting punished  
so let let's take a look at some pre flop ranges 
first of all if you look at utg open versus a  
hijack free so utg's response as you can see 
is to do a ton of for beding and really not  
that much calling but we're forbing more than 20% 
and only calling 19% and once again this this is  
happening because of a few reasons right first 
of all even though the three bet size is not  
particularly huge right but still at the end of 
the day we're up against a very strong and very  
linear range right hijack is actually to B think 
the strongest 8% of hands we are not really going  
to have any kind of range advantage on most parts 
and on top of that we have to play the rest of the  
hand out of position so there just tends to be a 
huge amount of folding right really not that many  
hands that are thr about calling you can see even 
stuff like pocket par are pretty much zero e right  
and then even something like kingj is wor like 
0.1 big blinds as as a c right so even with this  
relatively small three bet size we're already 
shifting in the direction of playing forbet or  
four so imagine if this was 4X and set right 
now a lot of these hands that were previously  
indifferent they're going to start becoming minus 
EV calls right and you know even hands like King  
Jack with it they're just going to start shifting 
towards forets right T and Jacks and greens going  
to start for all the time and once again that 
just repeats the whole purpose of making such a  
big three bet on the other hand if you take a look 
at 200 big blind ranges so for the same formation  
utg versus hijack repat you can see despite the 
fact that hijack is making it a touch bigger he  
making it 8.5 PB instead of 7.5 U utg is actually 
despite that he's doing more calling compared to  
uh other 100 pi blers and he's doing a little bit 
less foring the reason why this is happening is  
that at 200 big blinds right there's really a 
limit to how much you can for it right at 100  
big blinds you know if you have a like Jackson 
tense if we go back to the 100 PB ranges for a  
moment you can actually see that these end you 
know uh T Jacks Queens they're all for beding  
and just getting in at some frequency but at 200 B 
right we don't really want to be bloating the pot  
we had like queens or Jacks right the times that 
we happen to run into AIS and Kings you know it's  
not going to happen very often but now instead of 
only losing 100 big PLS we're going to be losing  
two or 300 big PLS so utg's hands are his hands 
are kind of tight here right he doesn't it's not  
ideal to be you know doing a bunch of calling out 
of position versus a very strong range right but  
neither can he just for bed and get it in with him 
like gream ands right so as a result he does much  
more calling and a little bit less for B thing 
uh compared to before and in position is able to  
take advantage of that by using a slightly larger 
three bet size right so this effect gets more and  
more pronounced as STS get deeper and deeper so if 
you're 400 500 big PL steep you can actually just  
make it like four times off the open and there 
really isn't anything that your opponent is going  
to be able to do about it right simply because 
uh there's not that many hands that is going to  
be through about forbing okay so question for you 
guys do you think the same logic is going to apply  
when we threw bet out of position as well so it's 
uh it's quite different for when you thre that in  
position right if you thre that in position there 
really isn't anything inherently wrong with like  
making it big and just bloating the partt in fact 
that's a fantastic result because the times that  
you get called you have all of the advantages 
right you're in position you know you have a  
stronger range you have an uncapped range so 
you're going to have excellent part share on  
the vast majority of textures right and therefore 
you just want to bloat apart as much as possible  
only thing that's stopping you is your opponent 
you know playing a very aggressive high frequency  
orbat on the other hand if we are out of position 
then we don't necessarily want to be loading the  
part like so imagine if we Face an open and we 
thre that to a huge size and we get caught right  
we're going to struggle on a lot of different TS 
so one example would be let's say if we take a  
look at small blind three versus button and we get 
a texture like 87 for 2 so on this sort of texture  
at 100 big blanks you know it's not the end of the 
world where we can still make like a three quarter  
spot size weed and uh if we're lucky enough to 
get a blank right SP blank can actually just ship  
it in with a bunch of over pairs right so we we 
actually have the option to play this to Street  
game on on these kinds of low connected textures 
and this really improves our at materialization by  
by quite a bit we don't really need to be playing 
that many turns and reverse out of position right  
because there's a higher chance that all of the 
money will get it in either on the Flop or the  
turn right so that's one of the reasons why small 
uses such a large size however at 200 Big BL Ste  
we have the same board small blind through versus 
button right notice that the times that we do see  
that we're making it a lot smaller so three qu 
spot just isn't a viable size here because if  
you if you make this large bat button is still 
going to call uh it's going to float a bunch of  
hands and then on the turn on a lot of different 
turns you're going to have a big problem right  
simply because you you can't you don't option of 
just shoving the turn and handing the hand early  
right that's no longer on on the table because 
you'll be risking way too much so what happens  
as a result is that small BL starts to PO control 
in it by the time that he wants to he met some  
kind of overpair he actually makes it a little 
bit smaller so he kind of um looking forward to  
the turn in river and anticipating that you know 
there's going to be a bunch of runouts that are  
quite difficult to play and we don't necessarily 
want to be just batting huge and looting the  
pot so it's actually a similar concept when it 
comes to pre flop right the reason why we don't  
want to make this kind of huge preed and start 
bloating the pot immediately is really because  
we're looking forward to the Flop or to the turn 
and we're anticipating that there's a bunch of  
textures where that that's really going to be 
really difficult to play right so you actually  
see in the GTO Razer Solutions right that add 100 
big lines when it comes to prile let's say presses  
button open small blind is making it 12 big 
blindes but if you change this to 200 big blinds  
versus the same 2.5x open we're actually going a 
little bit uh smaller right so uh the answer is  
that the sizing stays about the same right maybe a 
touch smaller because we're not really that we're  
not really as interested in bloating the PO out 
of position so this brings us to the second tip  
which is do not slow play Asus so Asus is a hand 
of course that is not that vulnerable so at 100  
big blanks it's very normal to to see the solver 
slowly versus a pbad for example and uh usually  
it's going to be indifferent between both options 
right raising is fine calling is fine and that's  
because Asus has two conflicting incentives on 
one hand it wants to race to build a bond and  
and to stack your oppon in the times that he has 
Kings and a but on the other hand Asus is also a  
hand that doesn't deny much Equity right meaning 
the time that you jam you're going to fold out  
hands like ace5 suited you're going to fold out 
hands like aack off suit uh and none of those  
hands actually have that much acity against you 
so at 100 big Lins these two factors actually even  
each other and we see that in most situations you 
know facing for bed especially when you are like  
in position my Asis tends to do a time of slow 
play so think about this which factor actually  
becomes more important when you're deep big blinds 
300 big blinds it actually becomes more and more  
important to raise and build the power because the 
times that you stack your opponent you're not only  
winning 100 big BLS right you're actually winning 
much more than that of course calling and keeping  
Bluffs in is still a valid consideration right 
but uh as you get deeper and deeper the upside  
of building the Pod and stacking your opponent 
just becomes way too imparted right and in these  
kind of situations we usually see a this become 
a Pure five b so for example if we take a look  
say 100 big light Ste so button open versus a 
big blind three B and the button decides if but  
goes for the four bat here um yeah so first of all 
you can see even button is slow playing Aces once  
in a while versus the the three B again it's it's 
just indifferent because of these two conflicting  
incentives right and then similarly if button 
goes for the forbat the time said big blind has  
Aces right he's actually also in different between 
uh jamming and calling so on one end of course he  
wants to jam in order to be able to uh stack hands 
like kings and Ace King but on the other hand it's  
not really necessary to be holding all of these 
sents out right you don't actually have that  
many outs against Aces so if we call and keep 
these hands in our opponent range right there  
there might be a chance that they could hit some 
kind of pair they might continue to Blas on the  
FL right and then we can get a bit of extra value 
this way right so that's why a head like Asus is  
pretty much indifferent to fast playing and slow 
playing because of these two conflicting factors  
however as TX get deeper right what you see is 
you know first of all when big bline goes for  
the three BET right button is always for betting 
Aces and uh similarly when when when Buton forets  
big planine is also never slow playing Aces right 
so it's it's not to say that uh we no longer want  
to you know keep in these kinds of hands like 
a opsu and A6 right that's still important it's  
just that upside of second your opponent becomes 
even more important right just because you're 200  
big blind Ste or 300 big blind steep you send to 
win much more the typ that you stack your opponent  
and because of that Asus actually becomes your 
B so how does the same concept apply both slop  
let's take a look at an example of this right so 
let's say if cut off rest versus hyra and we get  
this part of 65 use renbow so cut off is going 
to be seeb thing a little bit on the large side  
his which is pretty polarized it just has a bunch 
you can see has a bunch of over Pairs and a bunch  
of blops and all of the over pairs want to go 
a bit larger just because they're pretty strong  
head so versus this C notice what hyra does with 
his strong heads right two PA plus is actually  
slow playing almost all of the time right and 
that's because of the same two factors that we  
talked about where on one hand it wants to fast 
play to get stack it on the other hand it wants  
to slow play in order to retain hands like mostly 
these kinds of two overcard hands so if you look  
at your opponent's folding range it's really 
unnecessary for a hand like bucket fives to  
be folding out you know a king a green King Green 
right uh we would much rather just call and keep  
these s in the opponent's range right hope that 
they continue bling us hope that they pick up  
a PA so that we we can potentially stack them 
right so at 100 big bles uh it turns out that  
because there isn't that much money left behind 
right the second factor of keeping your opponent  
pling actually becomes much more important right 
so we don't really want to be raising a hand like  
fives and and Sixers because the maximum we win 
is only 100 big bles on the other hand if you  
look at what happens as we get deeper and deeper 
so for 200 Big lines the cut off is still mostly  
going for the large size right so versus the same 
CAD uh take a look at what two par and sets are  
now doing right 56 is actually raising all of the 
time and your sets are starting to raise at some  
frequency and that's because the first factor 
of building the part and stacking your opponent  
uh becomes much more important when you're deep 
and again this is going to become more and more  
significant as as you get deep bre and deeper 
right even that 200 B players we're starting  
to raise some sets much less if you go up to like 
300 or 400 big blindes becomes even more important  
to to fast play your strong hits right so again 
it's not to say that when you raise a hand like  
a set you know it's still not ideal to be holding 
out all of these BLS because most of them are just  
drawing it against you but it's just that the 
potential upside is is too is too great right  
to to be slow playing this kind of very strong 
head so if you look at the composition of our  
raising range it's very much built around hands 
like sets and two pairs right we don't really  
want to be raising hands like grece and Jacks 
that often right so this is in fact the complete  
opposite of what you see at 100 big lines right 
so at 200 Big lines raising range is very much  
built around your strong hands your noted hands 
whereas at a 100 B lines and if you take a look  
at what the raising range is built around is 
actually mostly over pairs right so hands like  
queens and Jags are now starting to race a lot 
more often because these hands also have a set  
of competing incentives on one hand a hand like 
J want to wants to raise for protection right now  
we actually have a hand that benefits from Equity 
denal time the types that we fold out something  
like a king or a queen right that that's pretty 
nice and folding on a hand that has two overcards  
against you of course we don't necessarily just 
want to it's not really such a clear cut race at  
the same time right because the times that you run 
into a hand like kings or prin right you actually  
potentially lose uh a much bigger so a hand like 
ja has has a bunch of competing incentives and  
if you think about how things change as we get 
deeper and deeper uh it's still pretty important  
you know to be folding out hands like Ace green 
and K green right but the downside of raising is  
that in order to get this amount of protection 
you're actually paying a much steeper price  
because the times that you run into Kings and 
Queens you don't only lose 100 Bitcoins or you  
potentially lose 200 Big plates so as a result 
as as PR gets lower and lower your raing range  
actually starts to revolve around more vulnerable 
hands like Jacks and greens right whereas the  
stronger hands uh mostly just start to slowly 
with the intention of keeping your opponent's  
BLS in okay so quiz question number one cut off 
versus big line where 500 big lines effective  
so facing a cat on 854 22 right big blind should 
big blind erace with pocket Force because we un  
block top Air or should we erace with Heats 
because it has better Equity with [Music]
C so if you chose Forest right unfortunately that 
is incorrect the good news is that you know it's  
not a mistake to do this at a 100 big blanks 
right so let's take a look at uh the 100 BB  
solution first so this is one example you know 
of how different your strategy can be whether  
it's uh you know depending on the stack that 200 
300 big ples deep and in this case 500 PP de the  
strategy is completely different so 100 big planes 
versus the CP very normal to race with a hand like  
force looking at our sets and stets right they're 
all mixing between race and call and there isn't  
really a very strong preference either way on 
one hand you you can say it benefits more from  
building the part getting C by lower sets but 
the downside of raising with eight is that you  
can see our value removal is pretty high right so 
value removal just means how much of your bonus  
continuing range that you block so usually if you 
have a hand that you're raising for Value you want  
your value removal to be as low as possible so 
I you want to have zero value removal so that  
you don't drop any of your opponent calling range 
and as a result you get much more value right so  
on the contrary a hand like force it might be a 
weaker hand right but at 100 big lines we don't  
mind raising this hand if you take a look at our 
blocker scores bucket Force has a value removal of  
two so that's much better than eight it means that 
you're blocking less of your opponent's continuing  
range and that's of course because cut off range 
still contains quite a bit of eex right he's going  
to have a bunch of a suited even a little bit of 
A6 off suit that's always calling so with Forest  
the good thing is that you unblock all of these 
sets right so at 100 B Lins doesn't really matter  
which one you race with both both are acceptable 
okay so now let's change this to 500 big lights  
you see that bucket for is almost a pure call 
at H is raising a little bit more often than  
before main reason for this is that when you're 
when you're 100 big BL steep you know it doesn't  
really matter whether you have top set or bottom 
set this actually brings us to the third tip which  
is that absolute hand strength matters small right 
so the definition of nuts changes with spr at 100  
B blinds it doesn't really matter whether you have 
top set or bottom set because if you think about  
the kind of range that your opponent is stacking 
off with it's going to be quite a wide range your  
opponent probably isn't going to B especially 
as you get shorter shorter like less than 100  
B lines there's no way that it's going to fall 
some kind of overp versus this kind of white  
stack off range it doesn't really matter whether 
you have the nuts or the second nuts right either  
way you're going to have pretty good Equity 
right but imagine if you're you know 400 500  
big play Ste 1,000 big playing Ste there's going 
to be a certain point whereby your opponent is  
realistically not going to stack off with an over 
right and as you get deeper and deeper the stack  
off range gets Tighter and Tighter and there could 
even be a point where he's own you know when the  
all of the money goes in he's only going to show 
up with sets and streets and in that case it makes  
a huge difference whether you have HS or fors 
right because with a had like eights um I mean  
either way you're not drawing that versus a street 
which is nice right but the good thing about eight  
is that when you run into a lower set like fives 
or fours your opponent is actually drawing to one  
out against you but if you get it in with force 
and you happen to run into eight or fives you are  
drawing to R out against your opponent so yeah 
that that's what I mean when I say you know when  
Shadow doesn't really matter whether your hand 
is the nuts or the second nuts but when you're  
deep this extra 1% can actually make all of the 
difference right so that uh that illustrates  
the third tip which is to pay more attention to 
Absolute and strength the final tip is that your  
stack is a weapon and you want to be using all of 
it right so with the nuts on the river uh we want  
to go a right it doesn't really matter how high 
the spr is because as long as there is no chance  
that we're behind or no chance that we're chopping 
right uh the bigger we bet the more eeve we  
actually generate right assuming our opponent is 
defending the appropriate range yes it's not going  
to call very often if we make a huge Jem but the 
times that we do get call we win a huge partner  
and that actually has the effect of compensating 
for um our opponent's lower calling frequency so  
it's a little bit like striking the lottery in 
a way right it's not going to happen very often  
but the one time that you strike the loty you can 
you can probably just like retire because you just  
make such a massive amount of money so just to use 
some simple numbers to illustrate the point like  
for a b of 100 into 100 so for a PO siiz B you 
can actually calculate how much EV you generate  
if your opponent is defending at the appropriate 
frequency so EV equals to beted size multiplied by  
calling frequency right so bet size is 100 calling 
frequency is 50% I mean in in simple terms our  
Bluffs are getting one is to one odds like we're 
risking 100 to win 100 so if our opponent wants to  
prevent our Bluffs from becoming too profitable 
right he needs to call at least 50% of the time  
right so if that's not clear it's fine right it's 
not really the topic of this webinar but you can  
always um check out previous webinar that I did 
on minimum defense frequency and I think Tom Tomos  
has made like a couple of excellent webinars on 
the topic as well but the here the point is that  
if you assume that your opponent defends MDF then 
with a n hand bigger is always better you know if  
you make a PO size b e is 100 multiply it by 
0.5 right which works out to 50 but now let's  
say if you increase your bet size to 2x opponent's 
calling frequency is going to to go down because  
now your BLS are risking much more you know you're 
risking 200 to win a pot of 100 so your opponent  
only needs to depend 33% of the time right but the 
times that he does call you win 200 instead of 100  
so this actually works out to a higher and if you 
do this for every single bed size what you'll find  
is that you get a graph that looks something like 
this right so if you look at the blue line the  
line that says 0% trap in a situation where your 
onent has 0% NS the highest EV size is actually  
just as big as possible right there's no real like 
limit to how big you can go or if you have like 20  
times support behind you just want to go 20 export 
all it uh unless your opponent has some percentage  
of nuts right so if you look at the yellow line 
and the red line the one that says 10% traps or  
20% traps right if your hand is not the absolute 
nuts and there is some probability of being behind  
uh then that sets a cap on your B sides right you 
don't really want to go too large and just isolate  
yourself against uh too many better hands right 
so again you know you can see according to these  
calculations if you make a 2X SP size B opponent 
only has to call 33% of the time and then as you  
get bigger and bigger maybe your opponent you 
know only has to call like 5% of his range and  
if it turns out that more than 5% of his range is 
a nut then uh it's not really sensible to be using  
such a big sizeer because you only get called by 
by the so you have to understand that what sets a  
cap on our bed size is the possibility of running 
into a stronger head if that possibility does not  
exist then we just want to go as big as possible 
right and this concept is especially important  
when you're playing deep stack right it's uh it's 
going to make you a lot scarier to play against  
if your opponents don't understand this idea and 
they're not like leveraging their T and you are  
you're going to have a huge advantage over over 
dies pointed having having chips behind you and  
having a deep sa is a little bit like having 
ammunition there's no point having all of this  
ammunition if you're not using it right so the 
trick is to be able to recognize spots where we're  
able to make these kinds of very big over bets 
right and they mostly occur in situations where  
you can have the nuts but your opponent for some 
reason is not able to have the nuts right maybe  
it's just a run out whereby you double barrel 
and you back or some kind of straight and your  
opponent obviously cannot have the straight right 
because it's not going to check all like a back  
do straight on the B right so these kinds of spots 
you need to be using all of your ammunition and to  
be leveraging your your entire stack so what if 
opponent is overfolded so in this case uh would  
you guys still continue to bet the same size or 
will you start sizing down you know because you  
think your opponent is folding too much looking at 
these calculations let's say if appropriate size  
for a hand is 2X right but you think your opponent 
might be overflooding that alone doesn't really  
justify betting smaller because you see when you 
bet 2xp your EV is 67 so 67 comes from 200 times  
0.33 of course and but let's say if your opponent 
is overfolded by a small margin this frequency  
is going to go down right maybe it's only calling 
like 30% and then from 67 it might go down to like  
60 or or something right but 60 still beats 50 if 
your opponent is not overfolded by a big enough  
margin then bigger is still going to be better the 
second point is that your range is also going to  
contain a bunch of flux right so if you're batting 
a balance range you don't actually have to worry  
that much that your opponent is overfolded right 
because think about the definition of overfolded  
overfolded means that your opponent is folding 
so much that your blocks are starting to become  
profitable right that's the definition of uh MDF 
so this brings us to the final question C of open  
versus big BL call so once again we 500 big BL 
right so on the board of King six D two to we  
bet small pick by calls turn complet the flash and 
maybe we bet let's say like 60% F and then we get  
called the gate so river is a check of diamonds 
so River doesn't change anything the question is  
how big should cut off that with the nut flush so 
a should he bet 35x but all in B should he make  
a small small overb or C should we have a mix of 
both [Music] sizes the correct answer is in fact  
to use a mix of both sizes okay so let's take a 
look at how this spot actually works in theory  
right it's a pretty interesting spot so you can 
see yeah King six used a kind of bit small big  
blank HS and maybe let me just show you big Line's 
calling range on the turn so versus a 40% out size  
B big line is continuing a range that looks like 
this right it definitely has a bunch of flushes  
uh including n flashes there's going to be you 
no hands like A1 of flabs or A7 of flabs that  
are slow playing uh so you know for those of you 
who answered b a small ler bed I I can see where  
you're coming from you wouldn't normally expect 
her to be such a huge shap you know versus uh  
range that is actually UNCA right so let me show 
you guys like how low MDF is versus uh 35x SP  
size SP so the formula for MDF is BET over B plus 
spot so 35 divided by 36 technically Alpha is 97%  
right so basically what this means is that versus 
35 export size B our opponent only has to depend  
about 3% of his range to keep our BLS indiff and 
nut flashes would be approaching 3% of his range  
already so you wouldn't normally expect there to 
be such a huge gem because in in the under normal  
circumstances you would just isolate yourself 
against 3% of nut hands in your opponent's range  
right but what makes this situation so special 
is that our Bluffs are actually exclusively  
hands like A9 and A8 at A10 right with the Ace 
of clubs right so because we're only bling for  
this size with the nut flush Locker our opponent's 
objective is actually to make this specific hand  
IND different right so from the perspective of 
our nut Locker that the times that we have the  
nut Locker opponent obviously cannot have the 
nut flash right so effectively what this means  
is that versus the J opponent cannot just only 
call with the nut flash right even if the nut  
flash is more than 3% of his rate right he would 
still have to include some non nut flashes as well  
because remember his objective is to make our 
nut blocker hands in different right the moment  
he starts uh holding all of his non nut flashes 
for example what we can do as the cutor is start  
bluffing with all of these Ace of Club heads right 
so that's basically what the big line is trying to  
prevent here right by calling with some non-nut 
lashes right and that that's actually how our n  
Tes can generate a time of Ed right knowing that 
our opponent will always have to call hands like  
green for clubs and n s of CLS no matter how big 
we go right so there's there's basically no limit  
to how big you can jam as long as you're holding 
uh a combination of like some nut doer heads right  
plus some uh nut flash heads okay so toos is 
asking uh is the big blind raising with worse  
than the nut on the river versus the smaller overb 
and that's a really good question if you look at  
car's response versus 1.5 export you'll see that 
some King High flashes are raising right but not  
all right just a little bit of King four king 
three a little bit of King five and then most  
of the flashes are just calling right but this 
actually explains why we need to bet small with  
the nut at some frequency because if we always bet 
large if we always go for the 35x per a right then  
our small overb is actually C at a king high flash 
when this happens right now our opponent can put  
us in the same tough spot by jamming with all of 
his King High flashes right and then also jamming  
with a bunch of hands like King n with the king of 
Cups so what we're actually trying to accomplish  
by uh mixing in some small bets with the nut 
Flash right is we're really just preventing  
our opponent from uh just raising or jamming 
hands like the king high flash and one more  
thing I want to show you guys is what happens 
if we only ever that big with the that flash
so but a first all of the nut flashes good jck 
and what we end up seeing is that now when when  
you look at the EV so if we look at strategy 
plus EV of a and like a SP right notice how  
when we over bet for small size our EV is 53 
big planks we bet 35 XP is only 22 big BLS  
right and the reason why this is happening is 
that because all of our flashes all of our nut  
flashes are going into the larger size right the 
times that we bet small our range is much more C  
so our opponent is actually able to probably 
start like just jamming us you know with all  
of these King High flashes and even some green 
high flashes as well and of course it's going  
to be balancing these hands with hands like 
King 10 and King n with the the single CLS so  
actually uh the times that we bet we make the 
smaller overb we're facing a ton of aggression  
and that makes us more to uh B small with a 
hand by A5 of flaps for for example right so  
this also shows why in theory these hands need 
to be mixing right it's really to prevent the  
bit line prob playing too aggressively versus 
the smaller overb that brings us to the end of
