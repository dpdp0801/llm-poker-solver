### TOPIC: the secret to crushing limp-raised pots
[Music] what's up fellow Wizards today I'm going 
to be starting a new video series focusing on  
leading flops the first video is going to be blind 
versus blind [Music] isops so why do I want to  
start out with this blind versus blind isoot why 
don't I start with someone something more common  
like leading from the big blind and the reason 
that I wanted to start with isop pots BVB is in my  
opinion one of the most underutilized lead bots in 
the game right now some of these boards as we will  
see have 85% leads and most players are playing 
them as pure checks it's also a fairly common spot  
to play just imagine in tournaments how often 
this happens in cash games it's of course less  
because you play more RFI from the small blind but 
in tournaments there's a lot of spots where you  
limp the small blind the big blind graes and you 
call I mean first of all you're limping a bunch  
in a small blind second of all the big blind is 
supposed to ISO race anything from like 30 to 40  
plus% so that happens a lot and you're defending 
a lot versus ISO as well so this a spot that you  
come into very often and as I said most people 
have not put enough time into studying it these  
strategies are often very unintuitive as well and 
so I think we can get a pretty high learning Roi  
just by looking at a few different stack depths 
to get a better understanding of what's going  
on global leading frequency so the spots that 
I'm going to be looking at today are going to  
be 10 big blinds 20 big blinds 30 big blinds 40 
big blinds and I'm not going to look at 50 big  
blinds I'm also just briefly going to look at 40 
big blinds because it's going to happen more at  
10 20 30 big blinds of course the deeper you are 
the more the disadvantage of being out of position  
is come going to come into play and you're going 
to have to play more passive and put less money  
into the PT the more shallow you are the less of 
a problem the positional disadvantage is going to  
be 10 big blinds we're going to be leading 35 C 
globally which is quite a lot so here I have the  
10 big blind Sim first of all we can see that the 
small blind is jamming almost half his range pre  
flop here uh basically just folding out the 
worst trash and then limping a lot of medium  
stuff sevens pluss a lot of big suited hands 
I just think it's like a good idea to have a  
quick look at range just before we begin looking 
at aggregation reports and strategies and all of  
that just so we can like start thinking about 
what we think the results are going to be and  
how the strategies will look big blind is playing 
two different race sizes in the Sim which is why I  
don't think this is the most applicable spot for 
in-game uh as population will in my opinion play  
very differently from this but it's cool to see at 
least how the theory works we can have a look at  
the 2.5 big blind range first um the big blind 
is going to have most of his strong pairs like  
sevens plus strong suited hands like Ace 10 suited 
plus king 10 suited plus Queen Jack suited Etc and  
some big off suit stuff like king queen off Ace 
Queen off plus a low frequency mix of a bunch of  
off suit trash like 10 off 95 off Etc if you have 
a look at the four big blind ISO range so it's a  
bit more polar it's going to have the strongest 
ASX and kingx off suit hands in there going to  
have pocket fives pocket fours a few suited ASX 
and kingx these ones and then we're going to have  
a bunch of the real trash like the most trashy 
hands like 7 off 60 off 73 off um 105 off Queen  
far off whatever a bunch of trashy stuff let's 
go into this one first and have a look at the  
aggregation report and see how it looks I think 
the 2.5 is the most applicable one to in-game I  
think a lot of people will find the 2.5x iso at 10 
bigs but I don't think a lot of people are using  
the Forex ISO so anyways 2.5x and we call going to 
go in here and press flops for aggregation report  
we can have a quick look over here first to see 
what's going on and we can see that uh overall  
lead frequency is going to be 35% approximately 
which checking 65% mostly we're going to be using  
a very small lead like one big blind 177% one and 
half big blinds 25% and then less and less of the  
bigger sizings we're playing some jams as well 
here you can actually filter like right now I've  
filtered for the highest frequency lead boards 
uh or the lowest amount of check uh you can also  
filter to see like what type of boards do you want 
to jam the most for example if you filter like  
this you can see that it's a lot of the the small 
medium connected stuff like 765 654 1098 very  
connected and low to medium I would say but if you 
go back to our highest frequency lead boards we  
can see that it's mostly Queen high and Jack High 
boards that we're leading you can do some stuff  
with the filters here you can filter for you can 
press the queen ey boards now you only see Queen  
boards we can see that our lead percentage went 
up to 47.5% uh we can check jackx as well uh 51%  
so even higher um another thing you can do here is 
just go into here you can for the reports filter  
for high card which is very convenient we can see 
that Jack high is the highest lead with like as we  
just saw 51% then Queen High 10 high n high so I 
think this part is kind of counter intuitive for a  
lot of people not as cancer intuitive as the stuff 
that we're going to see later in this presentation  
but I think a lot of people have a tendency 
to think that once you've limped big blind has  
raised and now you've called you're going to be 
at an advantage on a lot of the middling boards  
like the nine ey boards eight ey boards seven ey 
boards while the big blind is going to have a lot  
of the biggest hands and a bunch of the trashiest 
hands but as we can see here uh the best board is  
for us are actually not the 987 High boards it's 
the Jack High Queen High 10 high and we can have  
a quick look at why that is after we can also 
filter these boards by suit we're going to see  
that monotone boards are a lot better for us than 
they are for the big blind uh so our flush draw  
boards and the worst boards for us is going to be 
the rainbow bars uh if you go back to the ranges  
real quick just have a quick look here our range 
that for limping is quite suited heavy you know we  
have all of these hands we have some offit stuff 
as well but some of this we're going to be folding  
versus the race uh if you look at the big blinds 
ISO race for this size he basically has no suited  
hands he has like a few of these top suited hands 
like ace9 suited plus and some suit Broadways but  
in general he's going to be very Paar heavy and 
very off suit heavy while we our calling range  
here is going to be very suited heavy you know so 
it makes a lot of sense that the monotone boards  
are going to be good for us and the flush draw 
boards are going to be good for us because we're  
going to have a lot more flushes a lot more flush 
draw than billan will have uh we don't have that  
many offsuit combos like he does um okay back to 
the report so monotone boards are also good Frost  
uh paired boards are not going to be good for us 
triple board even worse for us um not paired best  
for us connectedness this is like very similar 
to the suited part uh our hands are going to be  
way more connected than the big blind's ISO range 
like quick look back at the ranges again where we  
see that his isos are like very disconnected like 
randomly spread out hands while the hands that we  
are calling are quite connected in general like 
of course the closer they are to this line of  
pairs on either side the more connected they are 
um just if you want to have like a good way of  
visualizing it the closer we are to this line in 
the middle the more connected we are and we can  
go back into the fops here and pick one of the 
high frequency spots so if you look at the most  
lead board here in the Sim it's Queen 96 FL which 
I think is a board that a lot of people probably  
won't be playing leads in at all so let's have a 
look what's going on there and why do we want to  
lead this board so much at first glance I think 
like a good place to start actually is to have a  
look at the ranges in here to see exactly what's 
going on put strategy for both here if we look at  
the equities first of all we only have a slight 
Equity Advantage we have 52.8% which is not that  
much you know usually when you start developing 
leading ranges it's because of the board is  
significantly better for us or that parts of our 
range do significantly better like we have a big  
nut Advantage for example uh I guess in this spot 
being so shallow like spr is only 1.25 positional  
Advantage is to a large degree mitigated and we 
do get to lead a bunch even without that much of  
an overall Equity Edge it's also quite easy to 
see what the solver is trying to accomplish with  
these leads it's using predominantly B17 or B25 so 
one big blind or one and a half big blinds looking  
to put pressure on this long stretch of very low 
Equity hands in villain range villains range if  
you look at this Equity charge chart here we see 
that villains range has a lot of like really bad  
hands you can also see it here in the equity 
buckets that for week hands he has almost 26  
6% of his range we have 20 trash hands he has 
33% we have 19% so he has a lot more of these  
just like totally useless hands and yeah he's 
going to be under a lot of pressure even where  
is like one big blind or one and a half big 
blinds here so I think that's what the solver  
is trying to accomplish let's go back and have a 
look at the four big blind ISO I think this one  
happens way less and it's a bit wonky not super 
applicable to real game in a current meta but it  
shows how extreme some leading spots can become 
with certain range constructions so remember how  
this range looks for us it's a lot of offsuit ax 
offsuit kingx High ones some trashy hands couple  
of paars and then like a few suited hands here but 
very off suit heavy and yeah no pairs every pair  
except for fives and fours are going to be jamming 
or isoing you know our range that we're calling  
here is actually very per heavy we're going to 
have 10 plus pretty much pure and outside of that  
it's very suited heavy and very connected we have 
a few of these offsuit connectors and outside of  
that it's mostly suited stuff you know so we call 
go back to the reports so looking at the types of  
board we lead on here it's easy to see that 
we prefer leading on the middling boards and  
preferably suited or mono we can do the same thing 
as before we can have a quick look at iards to see  
what type of boards we want to lead and here it's 
seven high8 High six High the more typical boards  
you would expect I would say uh but it's very easy 
to understand why like opponent doesn't have any  
of the over pairs he does he his range is just 
like so heavily condensed towards offsuit ASX  
and offit kingx um and just mostly the very high 
ones we can also click suits and we're going to  
see that mono is just crushing for us here uh 
th dra pretty good as well rainbow not so good  
connectedness uh we can look at pairing as well 
but it's just like not going to be uh too good for  
us not too much leading on a pair boards triple 
board is actually leading a lot here um and and  
if you think back to it it's like remember he 
only has fives and fours that's his only boats  
once the board is tripled if he's like de de Deuce 
for example he's going to have uh fives full and  
fours full while we are going to have 10 full 
Jacks full Queens full Kings full Aces full so  
triple board is actually um pretty good for us 
here which is also kind of caner intuitive you  
know connect connectedness very good for us as 
well let's go back and have a quick look at uh  
let's do 765 rainbow so it's mixing pretty evenly 
here you can call this a range lead um and it's  
mixing pretty evenly between uh B25 and Allin 
for b26 let's go for the AI solve here and just  
use yeah we can just use automatic settings for 
this one it's going to be fine and we can see that  
we're just jamming range we're limping calling 
a rise and now we're just jamming range pretty  
cool and we can see here why that is going on and 
it's rare that you find a board that is that good  
for uh for any player to be fair but especially 
as the limp caller uh this is very unusual like  
we have 62% equity which is insane we have 126% 
Equity realization which is also insane versus big  
binds 56 57% um if you look at the best hands 
and good hands here look at this how crazy is  
this 21% versus 2% and 50% versus 2.6% he just 
has like he just has trash on this board he it's  
just such a bad board for him you know the PT 
is nine big blinds and our pot share is seven  
of those almost 7.1 big blinds absolute Insanity 
of course this is not only because we have a lot  
of connected stuff and stuff down here in this 
region down here we also have tens Jacks Queens  
Kings Aces you know this are I I think it's like 
an Overlook overlooked aspect basically of what  
happens in this configuration so anyways I don't 
think these strategies are like super applicable  
so I won't spend any more time on it I'm going 
to move on to uh 20 big blinds now which I think  
is very very useful one to study okay so here 
we are at 20 big blinds and as I said I think  
this one is a bit more useful in game as the 
ranges are in my opinion quite realistic and  
close to how population plays it's perhaps the 
most important part of this whole presentation  
I would say if you account for how often this 
spot occurs combined with how much population  
is currently misplaying it we're going to have a 
look at how to play versus the three big blind ISO  
here which is by far the most common size so we 
limp in a small blind and big blind is almost only  
using the three big Blind Side we can have a look 
at this range real quick a lot of the best suited  
stuff king9 suited plus A7 suited plus sevens plus 
for Pairs and then like a very even mix like a lot  
of randomizing here with a bunch of the off suit 
grid uh but again not too many suited hands here  
beig doesn't want to Bluff raas any suited hands 
um because it's just you're just losing too much  
EV when you have to race fold hand like 105 suited 
you'd much rather race fall down like 105 off suit  
you know so that's why we're not seeing too much 
suited stuff in the grid here so he races and our  
calling range is again very heavy on the suited 
front we have a bunch of the like medium off suit  
stuff as well like all of these connectors lot 
of King High Queen high and yeah this middling  
off suit stuff but we have like every suited King 
every suited Queen um a bunch of suiting suited  
middling stuff and just looking at this right now 
is a pretty good clue of what's to come when we  
look at the strategies and I think if you spend 
a lot of time looking at this grid comparing the  
two ranges you can kind of try to figure out and 
you'll probably be able to figure out what boards  
are going to be good at us but let's go into it 
and I will show you what we mean as I mentioned  
at the beginning of this presentation some of 
these strategies are rather counterintuitive  
or unintuitive this one might be just the best 
example of that if we look at the bottom left  
corner here we can see that our highest frequency 
lead board is actually king king queen flush draw  
which this is a board we're programmed to check 
as out of position and auto cat as the in position  
pre- flop Razer usually right if you're playing 
like uh button versus big blind or lowjack versus  
big blind or whatever it is versus big blind 
um you're pretty much programmed to think that  
you're just checking this pure out of position and 
you're seting it for a small size uh with range as  
the position racer because it's just such a good 
board for in position usually blind versus blind  
the ranges work out completely different though 
and it's going to be very easy to understand  
why we get to lead this board once we take a look 
at the Sim so let's go into this one the highest  
percentage lead king king queen at first glance 
it's kind of similar to the queen 96 flush draw  
we looked at uh earlier right we don't have 
a massive Equity Advantage we're only 550 53%  
here but we beat him throughout the entire Equity 
chart as we can see down here like throughout all  
of it we're pretty much slightly ahead we can see 
like pretty much exactly the same thing here where  
we're structuring our sizing mostly around B15 
and B30 these two super small sizings to punish  
the trash part of his range which is over 37% 
here if we look over here like this whole grid  
of like offit crap that he's raising pre now has 
so little Equity now like we can see we're beating  
him in the best hands fine we're not beating 
him that much but we're beating him a little  
bit beating him a little bit for the good hands 
and yeah to be fair a little bit here as well uh  
we can also click this and show Advanced uh and 
we can see that for the top Equity hands we're  
actually slightly behind so the main driver 
of our Equity Advantage here is actually not  
the top top hands but rather the 70 to 90% Equity 
buckets where we crush him really hard if we look  
at the amount of trips we both have um which 
we can do if we click here we can go over to  
hands and we can have a look so if you look at 
the trips we're beating him by quite a bit like  
as I mentioned when we looked the ranges before 
we have like a lot of offsuit kingx and we have  
every suited kingx pretty much uh if you look 
at his range on the right side okay he has like  
also a bunch of D suit Kings here and some of the 
best suited ones but he's lacking a bunch of these  
suited ones and he's randomizing a lot with suited 
ones as well so for trips we're beating him uh a  
little bit 12.4 versus 9.6 but where we're really 
crushing him is second pair look at how much more  
que X we have than him we have every suited Queen 
X combo in limp call range uh and if we look at  
him he doesn't have any of them uh H just plays 
pure checkback with all of these preflop so he's  
lacking all of those and now of the offsuit ones 
um we both have a bunch of them a good place to go  
now is to run a little experiment here because 
let's say that here you know like small BL is  
supposed to lead 85% of the time which yeah it's 
a lot but what happens if the small blind misplays  
and doesn't play leads here so I think that's a 
good place to go now uh I'm going to go into the  
AI solver and make a little nod loock experiment 
all right so as we can see here the small blind is  
supposed to lead 72% which is of course uh quite 
a lot for this b26 size uh given that population  
is finding this lead I would say like on average 
maybe 1% of the time 2% of the time depending on  
what Stakes you play and whatever uh but it's a 
spot that you don't really see lead very often  
at all we can also have a look at the big blind 
strategy here what he's supposed to do when we  
check so yeah he's supposed to bet 35% of the 
time versus our check so let's see what happens  
here can go into this node lock up here think this 
is super useful these two functions right here to  
run these little experiments to see what's going 
on so we're going to not lock that small blind is  
going to check range which is how population place 
for the most part go in here and press lock and go  
so what you can do now is that you can go into 
here and you can compare the notes I think this  
is super useful so on the right side we have the 
GTO strategy where we're leading a bunch on the  
left side we have uh your average dude population 
guy who's checking range what you can do is you  
can click here and go into the EV Tab and you can 
compare so interesting to see here actually that  
even though we're supposed to lead a bunch we're 
not losing that much EV by not doing it 3.59 GTO  
3.55 um node loock forced check so difference not 
that huge I would say uh not crazy but the real  
difference is that once we've no locked this now 
we can look at how the big blind is supposed to  
play and big blind is supposed to check 92% almost 
now remember before the strategy of the big blind  
was to check back 65% now he has to check back 92% 
in a lot of similar spots like this I found that  
if you no loock pure checks for this for the out 
ofos player in a spot where he's to play a bunch  
of lead uh you will see uh big bind or in position 
player is going to be forced to check back range  
here it's not completely range but yeah it's still 
a bunch let's go into the big blind and we force  
him to keep betting at the same frequency as he 
was before so remember before the big blind was  
betting at a 35% frequency now he's down to 8% 
let's force him to bet at the same frequency as  
before we can't copy paste the ranges just yet but 
we can at least copy the frequency so I'm going to  
go in here type in 35% lead for the uh bet for the 
big blind versus the range check you know we're  
going to go unlock it and go so it's not going to 
be exact uh copy because the ranges is going to  
be looking a little bit different but we have the 
frequencies right and we can have a look at how  
much Equity the big blind is losing by continuing 
to play his GTO strategy versus a small blind who  
is now mistakenly just checking range so let's 
see we can go into here compare nodes and here is  
where the most drastic difference is so again on 
the right side you have um the GTO strategy versus  
pure check which is betting 8% of the time on the 
left you have a forced strategy where he forced  
to bet 35% of the time EV loss for big blind 
here goes from 345 to 317 so a massive drop for  
the big blind and uh another the side of course a 
massive EV gain for the small blind I think that's  
a pretty pretty important thing to keep in mind 
that if you're opponent here isn't playing GTO  
you should also not be playing uh your pre preset 
uh strategy right you have to uh counter adjust if  
he's misplaying okay next up we're going to go to 
30 big blinds and have a look at that one so here  
we see the 30 big blind range for big blind uh 
this is his ISO range again not too much suited  
stuff we can see that we're starting to draw a 
little bit from the suited portion of the grid  
here as well but not too much it's mostly the 
same thing like a bunch of pairs a bunch of the  
strongest suited stuff some of the big offsuit 
stuff and then like a very good mix of a lot of  
offsuit hands versus this again we are going to be 
calling a lot of suited stuff again we're going to  
be very dominant in the suited portion of the grid 
and yeah we're not going to have too much stuff  
here we we have a lot of King X and queen X still 
uh we don't have too much ASX a lot of is is just  
open racing or limp shoving you know so we don't 
have the strongest suited ASX we don't have the  
strongest offit ones so on asex front we're not 
doing too good on the King High and queen High  
were doing pretty good connectedness were doing 
very well so let's go in and see looking at this  
aggregate report for 30 bigs it looks pretty 
similar to the one at 20 big lines at first  
glance but it's actually quite different King 
High boards are LED around 40% of the time here  
we can have a look at the high card thing to see 
to see that the king ey boards are LED around 40%  
of the time while the queen ey boards which had 
the highest lead % at 20 bigs are only LED like  
22% of the time now um so quite a big drop for 
queen iards king iards very good for us now at  
30 uh if we look at suits monotone veryy good flra 
also good rainbow not so good connect pairing um I  
mean same thing pretty much tribl is not so good 
for us anymore because we don't have the same we  
don't have the same amount of over pairs uh that 
the big blind is lacking anymore so yeah this one  
is not going to be too good non-paired is going to 
be the best for us now connectedness that's going  
to be very good for us connected boards Yeah the 
more connected the better we can have a look at a  
hot spot here as well can have a look at the king 
88 flra which also is pretty counterintuitive one  
um to lead like overall we can see that our 
leading frequencies are going down as we're  
going up in blinds uh as I mentioned before the 
more blinds you have the deeper you are and the  
more the disadvantage of being out of position is 
going to affect the strategy so here we're down  
to already leading only 18% of the time but we 
still have some boards that are like really really  
good for us a bunch of these King High boards 
specifically again I like to start off by going  
into the ranges and looking at the equities um so 
here 56% Equity we have way more aex and way more  
King X than him uh like if you look at the trips 
which is going to be the 8X portion of the range  
we have almost 11% he has 6% so almost double 
if we look at top pair which is going to be the  
kingx portion of the range uh we have 18% he has 
11 and a half so yeah beating him quite a lot uh  
on those so the best hand portion of the range you 
can see that 30% versus 16.2% I think we can do  
the same thing as before we can have a quick look 
in the AI solver to see what happens if we don't  
play leads here okay so for this one I'm going 
to be using a a dynamic Sim where I've entered  
my own sizes and stuff just to make it a bit more 
complete than the automatic one for a lot of spots  
it's fine to just use the automatic one for some 
spots it's going to be better to build your own  
uh sizings for this one we can see that once I've 
built this one we're leading almost range for B25  
if we go to the nod loock here and force him to 
check range it's going to happen so this is GTO  
strategy on the right and population strategy on 
the left and EV has gone from 4.58 to 4.47 so bit  
more of a significant drop in this one I would 
say compared to the king king queen earlier but  
as we're going to see the biggest drop in a here 
is also going to be for the big blind if he does  
not adjust to our new strategy but first before we 
do that we're going to have to look at and the big  
blind how he plays versus the GTO strategy so I'm 
going to unlock all and continue uh now it will  
revert to the GT strategy which is just leading 
pretty much range so we see versus this the big  
blind is going to bet at a frequency of 42% so 
I remember that number 42% I'm going to go back  
here and lock uh lock a pure checking strategy 
and then we're going to force big bind tobat at  
42% frequency uh and as I said before this is not 
going to be completely perfect because uh we can't  
copy exactly the range that is's betting just yet 
uh but we can at least get the frequency right to  
get an idea of how much Equity we're losing uh by 
playing this so I'm going to lock and continue big  
blind EV now went from 3.53 to 3.24 which is a 
massive drop of course massive massive drop in  
Eevee so yeah it just shows again how important it 
is to take into account how population is playing  
and not just play your predefined strategy 
so we've now moved up to 40 big blinds this  
is going to be the last one I have a quick look at 
because Above This there really isn't much leading  
happening um because we're getting too deep so 
let's take a quick look at this one to wrap it up  
and then we'll go through a summary so he just 
uses this 3.5 sizing we can have a quick look  
at his range here's ball um just to see that now 
he's becoming a bit more suited he has a bit more  
Suited than before uh just because he doesn't get 
limp shoved on as much anymore um but he still has  
a bunch of dsit stuff as well and a bun of the 
best hands of course our range we're not going  
to limp shove as much anymore like 9% and our 
calling range is still going to be very suited  
and connected more so than him you can see that 
it's the same type of hands as before just a much  
smaller percent lead at this stack depth we can 
have a quick look at the reports for High cards  
suits Etc um just to get a idea of what's going on 
here um we can see now that King high is still the  
most LED and then it goes to nine high8 High 10 
high uh using a bit more of the bigger sizings on  
these middling boards and more smaller sizing on 
the king ey board for suits monotone still going  
to be the best for us plus straw second best and 
rainbow not so good pairing going to be the same  
as well not paired is the best paired and then 
tripled uh connectedness is going to be good  
for us same pattern as we saw before so I think 
good place to go now is just straight into the  
summary section and we can have a look at our most 
important findings and how to think about this  
spot so to summarize initial EV gain of studying 
these spots are going to be very high I suggest  
that you do exactly what I do now you go into 
aggregation report to have a look uh take a bit  
more of deep dive maybe you open the GTA wizard 
trainer tool and play different stack depths in  
this formation and I think you're going to learn 
a lot rather quickly as I mentioned before there  
is diminishing returns in studying poker so if 
you're studying button versus big blind the single  
Ray PS which you've probably studied a lot already 
there's going to be a lot of diminishing returns  
there while if you studied this spot which let's 
be honest most of us have haven't studied enough  
like even the High Roller scene like try or EP 
high rollers or the 10K on GG or whatever it is  
you don't really see enough of these strategies 
uh being implemented so it's clear that people  
have not studied it enough and that also means 
that it's a great way to put your opponent into  
spots they're not used to phasing right since 
population isn't really playing like this yet you  
can put your opponents into nodes that they're 
not used to playing and they're going to have  
to Freestyle a lot in spots where you know what's 
going on and they don't that leads us to the next  
point which is that it's important to adjust to 
your opponent's anticipated mistakes as we saw on  
the king king queen and the King 88 like how much 
EV big blind was losing by not adjusting to the  
small blind range checking it's quite significant 
so keep that in mind when you're playing as the  
big blind that if the small blind isn't leading 
as he should you also have to adjust a lot lastly  
this happens more at more shallow stack depths so 
around 10 big blinds it happened a lot at 20 a bit  
less 30 bit less and uh yeah 40 50 big blinds it 
kind of stops happening um or very low frequency  
at least simply because we're out of position and 
the deeper we get the more the disadvantage of  
being out of position is going to play a role and 
the less we want to try and build a path that's  
simply it if you have any questions then please
