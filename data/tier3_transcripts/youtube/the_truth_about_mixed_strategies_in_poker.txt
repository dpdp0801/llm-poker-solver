### TOPIC: the truth about mixed strategies in poker
have you ever looked at a spot in a solver and 
found that basically every hand in your range  
is taking various different actions at different 
frequencies these spots can be very confusing so  
if you're struggling with interpreting 
these situations this video is for you  
hi Wizards I'm Matt Hunt and today we're going 
to talk about the truth about mixed strategies
now let's start with a very simple question which 
is what is a mixed strategy well the best way to  
answer this is to actually talk about what 
a mixed strategy isn't because there are a  
lot of misconceptions that exist here first and 
foremost a mixed strategy is not playing the same  
hand different ways in different circumstances 
you'll hear this quite often you'll hear players  
say something like "Well against Joe I would 
three bet this hand but against Steve I think  
flatting is better." And that right there is 
not a mixed strategy for the reasons that we'll  
explain in just a second that is not something 
that we would classify as being a mix because  
essentially it's two different strategies it's 
two different spots two different situations  
two different approaches with a specific hand 
similarly if a player is saying something along  
the lines of "If stacks were deeper I would 
call but at this stack size I think folding  
is better." That is also not a mixed strategy 
once again that is two separate strategies for  
two separate spots so it's very important that 
when we start to think about and talk about  
mixed strategies we employ the term in the right 
way and we don't start discussing concepts that  
actually are pretty much completely different 
from mixed strategies when we're talking about  
more than one different approach being viable for 
a hand based on circumstances well that's not a  
mixed strategy that's really an exploitative 
strategy and we're getting into a completely  
different realm if we start talking about that so 
let's start thinking about the reality of what a  
mixed strategy actually is well essentially it 
comes down to the idea of randomization a mixed  
strategy is a strategy where we are randomizing 
our action in a specific circumstance specific  
situation in one of a few different ways there are 
many different ways that you can randomize you can  
use something like an environmental factor around 
you like the tournament clock if you're playing a  
tournament you can look at the last digit on the 
tournament clock and say if it's between zero and  
four I'm going to do this if it's between five 
and nine I'm going to do something else there  
are various different ways that you can do this 
you can use looking at your chips and seeing which  
way the chip at the top of your stack is aligned 
if you're playing online you can use the clock on  
your computer all sorts of things you can do to 
use randomization as part of your strategy and  
anytime you're using this randomization you're 
employing a mixed strategy anytime you're doing  
the opposite where you're choosing one option 
ahead of another that means you are employing  
a pure strategy so ultimately these are two 
completely different contrasting things we're  
either randomizing or we're not randomizing so 
the question becomes then why would we randomize  
our actions why would we want to essentially give 
up control over our action and hand it over to a  
random factor well there are a few reasons but the 
easiest way to understand why we might do this is  
to start by understanding why the solver does it 
well the solver does it because it needs to remain  
unexploitable in all aspects of its strategy 
in the solver it's playing against the perfect  
opponent it's trying to ensure that every part 
of its strategy every range that it has is going  
to include strong hands bluff catchers bluffing 
candidates and so on across all possible betting  
lines to avoid being exploited or in other words 
allowing our opponent to make a deviation that  
improves their EV so it's essentially just trying 
to maximize its EV but it's playing against itself  
it's playing against a perfect opponent that can 
spot any weakness and therefore it understands  
that it has to figure out a way to make every 
part of the strategy coherent and to make it  
functional by including different types of hands 
that have different functionality and can achieve  
different things so now that we've covered why the 
solver might randomize let's talk about when this  
is actually going to happen in what circumstances 
is this going to happen well generally it's going  
to be anytime the EV of two actions is essentially 
the same so it's going to be situations where both  
calling and raising for example have the same EV 
against a perfect opponent or where calling and  
folding have the same EV folding being zero and 
calling also being zero essentially it's in any  
circumstance where it doesn't matter what we do 
in each individual instance however over time if  
we always took the same action in these spots that 
strategy would become exploitable if we take every  
bluff catcher in a river spot and we essentially 
fold it all the time then ultimately we end up  
folding at a pretty high frequency and it becomes 
much more straightforward for our opponent to  
identify that they can exploit this tendency they 
benefit from us overfolding in this instance so we  
generally are going to see that when the solver 
is doing this it's because this is an area where  
a hole in our strategy an exploitable aspect of 
our strategy could exist if we simply did the  
same thing every time so that's why this exists 
that's why this happens now I'm going to take  
a quick look at a spot that I've prepared which 
is an example of a mix strategy it's relatively  
simple pretty straightforward but hopefully it'll 
illustrate the concept pretty well so this is our  
example spot right here it's actually a very 
straightforward cash game scenario we are at  
no limit 500 2.5x open from the hijack and we're 
on the button and as you can see there's a lot of  
hands here that are featuring a mixed strategy 
in fact almost all the hands that are putting  
money in to any degree are mixing at a pretty 
significant frequency the only hands that are  
playing a certain action purely are aces ace king 
and kings that's it even queens is not taking the  
same action 100% of the time ace queen suited 97% 
of the time it's three betting but 3% of the time  
it's flatting and so on you can look through the 
entire rest of the range and there are no hands  
other than the folding hands that are taking a 
certain action purely even fives and below they're  
mixing calls and folds in this circumstance this 
is a great example of mixed strategies in action  
if I click on the EVs for each hand over here and 
then we convert it to percentage of pot you'll see  
obviously all the hands that are playing pretty 
much pure fold are making 0% of pot of course  
but then if we look at the hands that are calling 
you can see that a lot of them the ones that are  
taking a call option at a pretty low frequency are 
making almost exactly zero 98 suited for example  
exactly 0% of pot 10 9 suited very slightly more 
than that and so on there's a few hands over here  
that are making 0% of pot there's a few hands up 
here and so on so all these hands that are mixing  
between call and fold are doing it because the 
EVs are the same same goes for three betting if  
we highlight three betting you can see these hands 
once again are falling into that category where  
the EV of raising you can tell from this graphic 
is 0% of pot we're looking at all this stuff here  
pretty close to zero a lot of this stuff down here 
pretty close to zero all this stuff pretty close  
to zero and so on so obviously even though there 
is a tiny margin for error in the actual sims  
themselves the solver doesn't calculate to the 
most precise degree of accuracy in every single  
case there's usually going to be some scope there 
for some slight inaccuracy so for the most part  
here you can see that because the EV is close 
together or the EV is in fact exactly the same  
the solver is choosing a mix and if we go back to 
the baseline strategy you can see that there's a  
lot of hands here where it's pretty close between 
three bet and call you can see all of this stuff  
right here is really never folding at all but 
it's definitely not sure whether it should flat or  
three bet and that's reflective of the fact that 
we need board coverage in both of these ranges so  
ultimately this strategy will come up quite a 
lot you'll see mixing coming up quite often in  
these preop spots and in essence it's because we 
need to have the right kind of a three bet range  
to attack the original razor here but we also need 
to have the right kind of a flatting range so that  
we don't get attacked by the players left to act 
behind in these cases as well so there's a variety  
of things that we're trying to balance up against 
each other here to create a well-rounded strategy  
and that's where we're trying to get to with our 
ultimate outcome here so that's the basics of why  
these mix strategies exist in these spots we're 
trying to protect our ranges from all possible  
angles but of course the big question now is do we 
actually need to mix in practice and unfortunately  
the short answer is maybe because it's true that 
there will rarely be instances where your opponent  
can specifically make adaptations based on knowing 
that you are never mixing in a certain spot but  
the impact of never mixing on later street nodes 
in the game tree can be quite significant so it's  
going to quite often affect the way that turns 
and rivers are going to play out if you don't  
mix a certain hand on an earlier street and we 
call this the downstream impact the impact that  
a decision has on everything that comes after that 
decision point it has a big impact on subsequent  
nodes in the decision tree and I can illustrate 
this with a spot that I picked out from a cash  
game scenario where we're just playing a chippy 
v circumstance and we have a board come out that  
requires a lot of mixed strategies with various 
types of hands it's an 874 flush draw board so  
let's take a look at that so here's our spot that 
we're looking at as I mentioned it's a 100 big  
blind cash game spot chip EV ranges very basic 
straightforward situation probably replicating  
a timed rake live game let's say using these 
chip EV ranges and we're in lowjack against  
big blind formation 5.5 bigs in the pot after 
we open a 2.5x big blind calls we go to a flop  
and we get this 874 two spades flop now I have 
removed the big blinds don bet range here just  
to simplify the sim a little bit and allow us 
to work a little bit more straightforwardly by  
looking at what we're doing against a pure check 
strategy not complicating things by introducing  
different variables about what the donk bet size 
is and things like that and you can see that our  
bet strategy here basically employs this 40% of 
pot sizing and it's not betting at a very high  
frequency here either we're betting about 40% 
of the time now that's just simply because this  
is not a great board for in position it's a board 
where if we allowed the big blind to don bet they  
would be doing it quite a bit they have a pretty 
strong range here so naturally in position isn't  
going to be able to be super aggressive but the 
interesting factor is of course there are a lot  
of mixed strategies going on as you can see now 
the best way to get a grip on this is to look at  
the filters on the right hand side as you take a 
look at the equity buckets you can very clearly  
see that there's no bucket of hands here that is 
heavily favoring betting and there's no bucket  
that's heavily favoring checking we're a little 
bit more inclined to check with the weak hands you  
can see right there but ultimately every category 
of hands is betting and checking at a decent  
frequency here even if you break it down in a more 
granular way there is a little bit of linearity to  
the betting range you can see where the the cut 
off points are there but even the weakest hands  
are still betting a decent chunk of the time 
and only the exact nuts 65 is betting at 100%  
frequency here same goes for all the categories 
of draws it's kind of splitting 50/50 on average  
and if you look at this construction here little 
bit of polarity if you look at hand categories but  
again in general we're mostly seeing a range where 
there's a lot of mixing going on and no specific  
category of hands is heavily favoring betting 
or checking and what this does is it creates a  
circumstance where let's say when we check back we 
still have plenty of potential hands that can be  
strong in our checking back range there are hands 
like if we filter for the top of our range aces  
and kings that are checking back this flop a good 
amount queens is not checking but that's because  
most of the combos of queens are not in the best 
hands category that we just highlighted we've even  
got some sets some two pair that's checking back 
in fact all of our 87 is checking back so we've  
got a pretty wellprotected checking back range on 
top of that we've also got a bunch of flush draws  
we look at not flush draws flush draws and combo 
draws our flush draws are only betting about 60%  
of the time on the hole here so clearly when it 
goes check check and the turn is a spade we're  
going to be able to have a flush quite often 
and as you can see on this jack of spades turn  
we do now have a flush approximately 5% of the 
time not a huge frequency but it's decent it's  
enough to protect our range to some degree so our 
next step is now to see what happens if we decide  
not to take that mix strategy on the flop what 
happens if we play this spot differently well  
right now when we get to this jack of spades turn 
our EV share is 48.58% of the pot which is not bad  
just under half the pot we check back the flop we 
still win about half the pot it's pretty good but  
let's see what happens if we decide to lock our 
flop strategy and in this case we maybe decide  
that on the flop we are going to just always bet 
every single straight set and two pair and we're  
going to always bet all of our combos flush draws 
and not flush draws so ultimately everything that  
is a strong draw flush draw plus is going to bet 
this flop and we're actually also going to throw  
the open enders in there just for good measure 
10 9 people tend to bet a lot of openenders here  
so we're betting all combo draws flush draws 
and not flush draws and now we're just going to  
lock so we're going to basically say we're still 
playing everything else completely optimally still  
playing a perfect strategy with the rest of our 
range but we're just betting all of our strongest  
hands at 100% frequency see what impact this has 
now previously our opponent was able to bet that  
Jack of Spades turn about 75% of pot and they 
weren't betting that often but now when it goes  
check check and we get that jack of spades turn 
see what happens take a look at this they're able  
to bet 2.5x the pot they're just using a geometric 
size 2.5x pot to E size with more than half of  
their range they are just applying insane amounts 
of pressure here because our range is completely  
capped and take a look at our EV share of the pot 
it's gone down from 48 1.5% to 28% less than 28%  
we've cost ourselves about 20% of this pot 
by never checking back a flush draw and never  
checking back two pair plus it's a huge deficit 
now it's not necessarily of course going to be  
the case that our opponent is immediately able to 
realize that this is exactly what we're doing but  
as you'll see in a second it's not as complex 
as you might think for them to figure this out  
so let's talk about it a little bit so like I 
say you're probably asking right now surely my  
opponents are never going to figure this out well 
unfortunately for us they don't have to and what  
this comes down to is you're probably spending 
a lot of time thinking about how your opponents  
perceive your game and a lot of players spend 
too much time thinking about this because your  
opponents aren't going to have enough information 
about you to make specific adjustments you're  
right about that you're right that it's very 
difficult for them to know that you specifically  
are doing exactly this in this spot however the 
better players that you're playing against will  
have a pretty good solid understanding of how 
the average player in that player pool is going  
to play a specific spot and that becomes a problem 
for us because if that's the case and here's why  
even though it's true that even your toughest 
opponents don't know your game well enough to  
identify your specific weaknesses they do know 
the weaknesses of the player pool and if your  
weaknesses match the weaknesses of the player 
pool then the way that your opponents play a  
certain spot by default based on their assumptions 
and their understanding about how their player  
pool tends to play is going to essentially 
be exactly how they need to play in order to  
exploit you individually and that's where things 
start to become really problematic because now  
your opponents are not even going to have to know 
anything about you specifically all they're going  
to have to do is have a broad understanding of how 
the player pool plays and how to adjust to that  
and it's not that difficult for a good player 
to recognize that if you check back the flop  
and you never have a flush on a flush card turn 
they can apply a ton of pressure to that range  
so what it comes down to is that the best way 
to avoid getting exploited by the better players  
in your player pool is to simply make sure that 
whatever weaknesses do exist in your game are not  
the same weaknesses as what exists in the rest of 
your player pool you don't want to be making the  
same mistakes as everybody else it's okay to make 
mistakes especially if those mistakes are very  
difficult for your opponents to figure out but if 
you're making the same mistakes as everybody else  
does that's where it becomes a real problem so 
you might be now wondering well does that mean  
I should start randomizing all the time well 
the answer is no because there is a way out of  
this dilemma while it's true that mixing at the 
range level is crucial because obviously we can't  
just range bet or range check every single spot 
and mixing at the hand class level so different  
categories of hands is also very important 
because it helps to protect our ranges and  
moderate bluffing tendencies in the different 
ways that we've talked about mixing at the  
individual hand combination level is usually not 
very important at all as long as we understand how  
the other levels function as long as we understand 
approximately how aggressive we're going to be and  
we understand that different hand categories are 
going to have different preferences that we have  
to have a variety of hands in our range that 
exist across different categories as long as we  
understand those things we don't generally have to 
employ a mixed strategy with individual hands very  
often or to put this another way what it comes 
down to is this simple statement if you understand  
the properties of individual hand combinations 
and the function of specific bet sizings you  
will very rarely need to actively randomize not 
going to say never because of course there are  
spots where you might be up against tough players 
randomizing can be useful of course but you will  
very rarely need to actively randomize if you 
understand the function of bet sizings and the  
properties of different hand combinations so let 
me show you what I mean by that i'm going to look  
at this same example same one we just looked at 
and we're going to illustrate a range that is not  
mixing at all but it's selecting hands purely on 
the individual hand combo level so we're back to  
our same sim as we just had and in this case what 
I've done is I've taken about 5 10 minutes not a  
huge amount of time you know haven't gone through 
this in incredible detail but I've taken some time  
to flesh out a strategy and a construction for 
our range here that doesn't involve ever doing any  
mixing with any hand candidate so as you can see 
the frequencies are fairly similar to what they  
were before frequencies here are at about 40% 43% 
in this case sizing is the same and by contrast  
if we look at the summary of all the hands and we 
flip through here every single hand if we scroll  
all the way down is either purely checking or 
purely betting there's no hand that has a bit of  
red and a bit of green here right so every single 
combination of hand is playing a pure strategy but  
the entire range is constructed in such a way that 
if you look at the categories they still resemble  
somewhat what we saw before there's a little 
bit of difference here in this grouping there's  
a little bit kind of a different shape here and 
still a little bit of linearity there there are  
certain combinations of draws that are betting 
more often you can see we got the the flush  
draws and the openenders betting a little bit more 
frequently so there's certain tweaks that maybe if  
you wanted to go into even more granular detail 
you could really you know pick out the specifics  
here and get this 100% accurate but even in just 
5 or 10 minutes of building out this strategy we  
have arrived at a similar frequency and a decent 
range construction and if we look at where  
we're at in terms of EV on the flop we're still 
outperforming Villain on the flop we've got 53.4%  
4% of pot uh EV share here so on the flop we're 
doing fine and crucially when we look at that jack  
of spades turn we are no longer getting absolutely 
wrecked by these massive bets we're making about  
43% of pot and villain is only able to use a 
40% size they're not able to use this massive  
polarized geometric size here so even though 
we are still about 5% of pot shy of where we  
would like to get to here our optimal pot share we 
are doing significantly better than the strategy  
where we just took an optimal strategy but always 
bet our strongest hands and our draws and this  
didn't even take that much effort it took 5 or 10 
minutes like I say now I'm not suggesting that you  
guys can do this without effort of course it takes 
time to get good at selecting the hands that we're  
picking but if you understand the properties of 
different hands and you understand the function  
of bet sizes you can do this you can learn to 
get good at this one of the factors that I use  
to help select the betting range here is simply 
suit interactions so for example offsuit hands  
that have a spade in them we're betting a lot of 
those right offsuit hands that don't have a spade  
in them we're betting far fewer of those that's 
definitely going to be a factor here that you'll  
see even in the baseline solution suited hands of 
course we're not betting all of our flush draws  
we're betting a lot of our back doors but not all 
of our back doors and we're betting a lot less  
often if we have diamonds or clubs those factors 
are going to be very relevant as well so again  
it's not a perfect metric but it's a very good one 
and it gets you pretty close to a good strategy  
without the need for any actual randomization so 
you might be left thinking well how do I actually  
get better at this because this is a very complex 
process well in this case the range builder on  
GTA Wizard is your best friend the range builder 
is a really really great tool you can use it to  
practice building some very robust strategies 
which don't involve any mixing or maybe you  
use it for employing some strategies which have a 
simple 50/50 mix on certain hands that's certainly  
an element you can add in if you feel like it's 
useful or necessary and remember also that you  
can use the range builder in conjunction with 
node locking this is really crucial you can nod  
lock a sim and then skip yourself out of looking 
at the answers essentially and go through a range  
construction exercise you can nodlock how you're 
going to construct your range against a specific  
type of opponent you can build a robust strategy 
that doesn't require mixing designed to cater to a  
specific tendency your opponent might have there's 
all sorts of things you can do but in general as  
you can tell if you are mixing at the right levels 
if you're mixing at the handclass level if you're  
mixing at the range level you don't actually have 
to necessarily mix at the specific combo level  
that often so hopefully this video has given 
you a little bit of a guide of how you might  
want to start incorporating mix strategies or why 
they might be useful and it's also reassured you  
that there aren't going to be very many situations 
where you're going to need to randomize and leave  
your strategy up to variance in most scenarios so 
thanks everybody for watching and if you'd like  
to check out another video I have one right 
here that I recently made where we talked  
about the situations where you should not use a 
mixed strategy and in fact you should range bet  
you should bet every single hand so if you want 
to check that video out the link is right here  
otherwise if you have any questions I'll be 
available on Discord and you can tag me and  
ask your questions right there until next time 
everyone thanks for watching and good luck with it
