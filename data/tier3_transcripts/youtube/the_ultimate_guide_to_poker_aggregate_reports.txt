### TOPIC: the ultimate guide to poker aggregate reports
hello Wizards today I'm going to show
you how to find Trends and build
heuristics using data analysis with GTO
Wizard's most powerful tool aggregate
reports
what are aggregate reports well in my
opinion these are the most underutilized
features in GTO wizard so an aggregate
report contains data from all 1755
strategically distinct flops they're
used to build bet sizing Trends and
heuristics in today's lecture we're
going to go over how to use aggregate
reports we're going to look at how to
play different flop textures how to
break it down by different textures how
to follow through on the turn and this
lecture is applicable to all formats
whether you play cash MTT Spin and go
heads up you name it this lecture is for
you aggregate reports are some of the
most powerful Tools in GTO wizard now
back in the day if you wanted to do
aggregate reports you'd have to run all
the flops yourself compile the data
yourself export it to a spreadsheet and
build an entire interface just to try
and extract data GTO Wizards interface
makes it much easier to find Trends and
look for the bigger picture in today's
lecture I'm going to start off with a
guide how to use aggregate reports we're
going to show you how to get the most
out of it how to use these tools
including all the niche features that a
lot of people don't know about from
there I'm going to teach you how to find
flop heuristics we're going to go over
systematic approaches that involve
writing stuff down and lastly I'm going
to teach you how to focus on follow
through and turn those heuristics into
practical skill let me take you through
my four-step plan the first step is to
master the tools we're going to learn
how to use all of the interesting and
Niche features that you may or may not
know about already we're going to go
over everything from flop to turn
reports how to use it how to filter and
how to group so that you can become an
expert with this tool step two we're
going to talk about how to find Trends
now when you're searching for big trends
you are trying to optimize two goals one
find filters that result in
strategically similar flops and two we
want those filters to apply to a wide
range of flops if you get too Niche then
all of a sudden you know you end up with
just hundreds or hundreds of filters
that are impossible to apply and if you
get too broad then the boards aren't
strategically similar enough so our goal
is to group boards together that are
strategically similar so that we can
learn more easily going forward step
three we're going to write it down
remember kids the only difference
between screwing around and science is
writing it down quote by Adam Savage so
I'm going to show you a systematic
approach to studying flops by recording
your observations in a spreadsheet or
document I'll provide you with a
template you can use but the important
thing is that you're trying to build it
yourself I'm not going to give you the
heuristics rather I'm going to teach you
how to find them yourselves because
let's face it most of the learning
actually occurs with the discovery
process in doing this yourself lastly
we're going to learn how to focus on
follow through so step four is practice
practice now playing turns and rivers
accurately is more important than
optimizing flop sizing right we can use
turn reports to get a sense of the
strategy on how to continue on some
board in some line and similarly we can
take our discovered heuristics plug them
into the trainer and then use those
settings to practice strategically
similar boards so that's the four-step
plan let's start with step one mastering
the tools I'm going to now walk you
through everything there is to know
about aggregate reports let me dive
right into the reports
and start with a tour of the software
all right so
how do we use aggregate reports so first
of all you need to select some spots and
I'm just going to choose simplest spot
some button versus big blind thing in
there
going to go flops
and check
now
what we're looking at here contains data
from all 1755 strategically distinct
flops
in the top right here we can see the
global betting frequencies so this
contains data for how button should bet
across all different flops we can see it
contains about 50 checking some small
betting some medium betting some large
betting some overbedding
at the bottom here we see a breakdown
of all the possible flops and right now
it's sorted by high card so ace high
flops King High flops Queen High flops
and so on you can click this and drag
through or just use your mouse wheel to
scroll
and you can see the strategy on
different flops
if I hover over any one of these
it's going to show the individual
strategy for this specific flop in the
corner here so 1075 we can see the
overall betting strategy for button in
this spot I can also click all and
that's going to show me things like the
overall expected value equity and Equity
realization
if I want to study particularly this
flop I can hit this button and that's
going to open up a new tab that shows me
how to play 1075.
but remember this lecture is about
finding the global betting frequencies
so I'm not so much interested in one
board as I am interested in finding
trends
now at the top here we can see different
groupings so for example I can Group by
high card
now I'm looking at all of the ace high
flops grouped together King High flops
Queen High flops Jack High flops and so
on
you can also Group by suits
and here for example we could see that
monotone boards tend to use a smaller
bet and check a lot more often compared
to Rainbow or flush chart boards
there's also pairing
so here we can see that paired and
triple flops
tend to be bet a lot more often and
again typically using a smaller size on
these paired boards
and of course connectedness
so I should mention connected means a
straight is immediately possible
open-ended straight draw possible and
disconnected meaning no open-ended
straight draws or straights are
currently possible
now there's two ways to view reports you
can either view it as a chart or as a
table
and they both have their pros and cons
now the table acts very similarly to a
spreadsheet you can sort by any column
so for example I can find which boards
use this over bet size the most or which
boards check the most which ones are the
highest expected value for in position
or out of position
now personally I prefer chart mode for
most uses but I do like the table mode
sometimes when I'm trying to look at
exact numbers
next we can group actions together and
this is one of the advantages of table
mode I'll show you so let's go back to
table mode
and here let's say I want to find
let's put in some bet we'll say 33
percent and
we want to find the most check raised
flop now I could sort by the most 50
Checkers flop or the most pot sized
check raise flop but what if I want both
of these together well I can group these
together
and now it's split up into fold call and
raise and I can sort it this way to find
the most check raised flop which in this
spot
appears to be nine nine deuce
so something else you can try
are filters filters are great
filtering
and I'm just going to go back to button
here
this is what we're going to be focusing
on most this lecture
when it comes to the study of flop
textures there's various ways you can
break it down
most systematic approaches can break it
down by suits pairing connectedness and
rank so for example
here we could choose flush draw
Broadway card low card low card that is
one filter you can apply
and here we can find
a set of flops that only fit those
filters and notice that these Global
betting frequencies up here
update to reflect our filtering
and this is what most of the lecture is
going to be about finding strategically
similar flops
like this one now
in here I'm going to switch it back to
table mode and you can always hit W so
I'll be using W from now on just as a
hotkey
and I want you to pay attention to one
little number in here that's quite
useful this is the filtered percentage
what does this mean
this means that within the filters we've
applied
4.8 percent of flops meet those filters
right and so again remember our goal one
is to find strategically similar flops
the other is to find filters that apply
to a relatively wide variety of flops
now how specific or how wide you want
your filtering to be that's up to you
so I'm going to switch back
now something else you can try is
instead of looking at strategy you can
look at expected value or Equity or
Equity realization so for example
here we can look at buttons expected
value across various flops and let's
group those Together by High card
I'm going to clear these filters
and of course we can see that ace high
flops are going to be among the highest
DV flops for buttons range
next to only two high flops which is
like
just 222 right
we can also look at big blind at the
exact same time so again
big blind tends to have higher AV
with these middling flops now sometimes
it can be a little hard to tell what's
going on with this because a lot of
boards run close so again
we can just switch
to table mode right
and here we can see highest EV flops in
position at a position
and note that I've got this sorted by
high cards right so a cyclops King High
flops Queen High flops and so on
and something else I want to point out
are these numbers in this column here
a lot of people
when they three bet for example King
King they'll think oh I always see an
ace on the board when I have King King
and something to realize here is well
yeah that's because ace high flops are
more common than King High flops are
more common than Queen High flops and so
on in fact the chances of getting a
seven High flop is only four percent and
the chances of getting an ace high flop
is 21 right
so let's go back
like I said
you can sort by expected value equity
for one or both players as well as
Equity realization
now I'll show you the one feature that I
think most people use a ton and that is
the Sorting feature so for example let's
try and find
the most checked flop
so from this drop down sort by I'm going
to click check
and I'm going to drag it to the right
and here we can see these are among the
most checked flops so it appears to be
ace high monotone is where buttons
should be checking for most presumably
because your fold Equity is just
terrible on these boards
and we can also do stuff like for
example which boards are betting the
most now you can for example use a
smaller size here
and I can click this again to reverse
the order
and it appears that paired boards
specifically paired boards with a
Broadway card are bet that a high
frequency using a small size
what if we want to see the most over bet
flops okay well I'm going to now sort by
that 125 percent
and here we can see that Ace Broadway
brick tends to be an over bet or check
strategy
right so let's test that heuristic
I'm going to plug in Ace Broadway
brick
and it's not going to be monotone it's
not going to be paired
now note the top right
we're seeing a lot more over bets
high frequency checks and not a lot of
these middling sizes right so this is
what I would classify as a set of
strategically similar boards I'm going
to dive more into that in just a minute
first I want to show you the rest of the
features in these reports
so again you can use a combination of
sorting
filtering and grouping to find
Trends and heuristics that are going to
make your flop strategies much easier
and it doesn't just have to be for the
initial C bet it can also be for example
for the Rays right it can be for how
often you should check raise how big you
should check rates which boards you
should just be over folding a ton on as
the defender
so remember it's not just about the
initial bet here we can also for example
look at which boards are dunked the most
right
now
that's mostly it for the
aggregate reports right that's
basically all of the features in there
there's a few more smaller features I
could show you for example here in this
table
you can click this little s
small medium large to expand these rows
this is better if you have for example a
smaller screen or just terrible eyesight
like me
and again any filters you apply for
example you could look at paired boards
we're going to update the filtering
criteria now this first row
button versus big blind we can see the
global betting frequencies so this is
everything now the second row are only
the filters we've applied right so we
can see just by comparing these two
boxes
that when I've applied paired flops
we're betting more often checking less
often and typically using a smaller size
almost never over betting paired flops
right
so again this is a nice easy way to see
how the strategy changes compared to
Baseline when you apply some filtering
you can also see at the bottom here
16.9 percent of flops fit our criteria
which are paired so this many flops are
paired
all right so next I'm going to show you
how to use turn reports
so
they're very similar to flop reports
I'll just put in some random flop here
plug in the strategy
all right so let's put in some small bed
big blind calls
and I can select the turn card or I can
simply press turns
again I love using turn reports because
I want to get that global view of what's
going on rather than uh just clicking
through cards one at a time
all right so here's the turn reports now
given that we have this flop and we've
taken this line
third-pot that call
this is the follow-up strategy
and so
the first thing I do when I look at this
is I try and sort it in a way that makes
sense so here you could sort it by suits
actions or cards
actions meaning you know bet the most
about the least and cards I think is
going to make the most sense for a
rainbow board right
here we can see that for example
on a seven or an eight it's typically
over betting and again on the right hand
side we can see the global betting
frequencies all right so here we could
see that for example we're going to
follow this up with a large bet quite
often and I can just group these
together for example
group like this over bet bet large bet
medium rarely ever using another small
bet except for example on a paired
second card
now in the turn reports there are a
couple other interesting things you can
try so for example
the filtering Works a little bit
differently here instead of filtering
for some flop you can filter for a
specific hole card so how should we play
when we have Ace King of Diamonds as an
example
and here we can see the strategy for Ace
King of Diamonds as well as the EV
equity and Equity realization
as you can see Ace King is tends to
check a lot on any 10 Jack or queen and
we tend to bet a lot on most other cards
sizing down on paired cards like a nine
or three and over betting on the rest
try and get the most value
again you can view the strategy
the expected value for one or both
players the equity or Equity realization
you can also group turn cards together
so I've got this on turns but we could
put it on cards for example and now we
just see two three four five six seven
this is probably easier for rainbow
boards but less effective for flush draw
boards
we can also use suits this is quite
useful for flush draw boards and pairing
so again we can see that it starts
sizing down on many of the paired cards
right
now there's an extra view here that a
lot of people don't know about so with
turn reports again we've got the table
view we've got the chart View
and this operates just as any other
spreadsheet would same as before but
then we've got this default view which
is very similar to what other products
you might have seen like uh for example
po or GTO Plus
and I like this view particularly for
looking at numbers and I'll show you why
if I wanted to see for example what is
the highest EV turn card in buttons
range not a trick question guys I'm just
I just pulled up a random spot here it's
probably Ace right so let's find out I'm
going to click button
and what I'm going to do now is Group by
cards and I'm going to sort
by cards and here we can see Ace is
indeed the highest EV turn for button
and we can see the actual expected value
here rather than a graph right
and again I can view this for one or
both players
we can also look at for example the
highest Equity card the bottom being
button the top being big blind
and of course Equity realization
so I'm going to be using a combination
of almost every feature I've shown you
so far
in order to move on to the next part so
let's go back here okay
so how do we find
Trends how do we find heuristics how do
we actually use all these features
to accomplish our goals
a few examples of how we can use these
reports to find Trends
and I'm going to show you some simple
ones that a lot of you will already know
and some more complex ones
all right so again I'm going to choose
the nl500 solutions you can choose
whatever you like now sometimes for
example you'll run into a spot where you
just don't have reports at the moment
right so I don't think these have
reports right now and you'll get this
message
now not every spot has a report but some
do so what I recommend you try is switch
between the type of solution and the
rake structure in order to find a spot
that works now we're always adding
reports on the go and we're always
adding more solutions and sometimes
updating those Solutions the end goal is
to have Solutions or reports for every
possible spot but it does take time guys
so
just so you know about that let's dive
into the simplest spot
button versus big blind again and we'll
look at some more complex spots later
so
let's go over how you can find very
simple trends for example we see that
across
all flops big blind is donk betting in
this spot about 4.1 percent of the time
let's try to isolate this
so what are we trying to do we want to
isolate the Donk bet heuristic
so our goal is to find a set of filters
or big blind donks a ton so how do we do
this well
let's find the most best spot so click
that once twice
all right so what do we see here
six five three seven five four five
three two
seven five three okay so lots of low
cards now the first thing you can try
for example is just looking at high
cards
and we can see that
all of these low cards here
are where we bet most often
okay what about connectedness
oh so we see that connected boards tend
to be high frequency donk bets okay okay
so we're starting to get an idea here
let's try a filter
so I'm going to filter
starting off with
just low cards right
and we're going to make this more
precise as we go
Okay so we've already increased this
from like
four point something percent twenty
three percent so this is already a high
frequency dock but we can make it
cleaner so notice that this includes
some tripled boards which are never
donketh some paired boards which are
very low frequency dog bed so okay let's
get rid of that so we're going to say
not paired
and we've increased this further so now
it's at 28 right
and there's still some low frequency
stuff so something else we can try is
making it connected
now most of these boards are already
kind of connected because they're close
together
now we've increased it to 32 so we've
got a pretty strong heuristic at this
point
if you wanted to make it even stronger
you could throw out these monotone
boards at the bottom which are low
frequency dunk bets right
so we can throw that out we can say all
right it's not monotone and any
connected board or any connected flop
cannot be paired so that doesn't
actually matter so again the heuristic
is
all the cards are less than a seven
there's a straight possible and it's not
monotone that's our heuristic that's the
thing we have to try and remember and
that's the thing we want to practice
now we can see here that this is a
pretty strong heuristic
most flops are not donked but this set
of conditions is a high frequency dock
bed right
if we go over to the table mode
we can see that we're getting a little
specific here so about 4.3 percent of
flops this applies to but
the Donk bed is already low frequency so
this is to be expected right
now this is a pretty strong heuristic
so ultimately the goal
is to
maximize the amount of flops this
applies to and again keep in mind that
if it's a something that doesn't happen
that often you're not going to get that
many flops but at the same time you want
strategically similar flops now a lot of
you guys will already know this it's
fairly straightforward for example if
you want to find the most overbed boards
like we did earlier just click this once
twice
oh
and you can see the most overbat boards
and just guesstimate a heuristic from
here right
you can also do the same thing for for
example
if you just want to look at pairing we
can say oh look at that
paired boards that at a very high
frequency you could do the same for
tripled boards but this accounts for
very few flops so let's try a new filter
I'm going to go with paired flops
as we can see
paired boards
tend to bet quite often and typically
using a smaller size not a ton of
overbedding going on lots of small sizes
right
high frequency bet small size
now something to keep in mind whenever
you're making heuristics is that just
because it applies in one spot does not
mean it applies in all spots for example
in a button versus small blind three bit
pot paired boards are often larger bets
as opposed to smaller bets because
you're targeting a different portion of
their range if you're looking at for
example just these over bet boards
that's going to change if you're looking
at early position versus big blind where
big blind actually calls things like Ace
King right and so
keep in mind that your heuristics do not
universally apply to all position Pairs
and pre-flop actions this is
specifically for button versus big black
now that said you can often group stuff
together so for example hijack versus
big blind and under the gun versus big
blind play very similarly because the
ranges are very similar
and so well it doesn't have to be
perfect you do have to try and test your
heuristics against different positional
pairs for it to make sense
now that said I want to show you guys
how we can take a more systematic
approach rather than just sorting by
some size and guessing right
and this is perhaps the most important
thing because
well looking at the actions is Maybe
one part of it actually starting to
write it down and building yourself a
system is the difference between just
slacking off and really intentional
practice that's going to improve your
game so
the next step is to record your
observations in some sort of spreadsheet
or document now how you do this is not
that important what actually matters is
just that you are recording it
so I'll show you a spreadsheet here
looks like this I can share this
template with you guys
one of my students actually improved on
it and I kind of took theirs a little
bit and modified it so
shout outs to him he knows who he is so
in here
basically what happens is I've broken
down
all of these so on this side we've got
positions pre-flop action stack depth
here we've got the filters now I should
mention that
GTO Wizard's next update will allow you
to save filters and that's going to be
really useful because once you build
your heuristics you'll be able to save
all those filters and reuse them in
different spots
for now I'm just writing it down so high
card middle card low card the suits
pairing and connectedness and there's
just little drop downs here for example
if you want it to be not monotone you
could just pick rainbow plus flush draw
if you want it to be connected you can
hit connected
on the right hand side we've got a spot
where you can take notes
so here I've noted down the trainer now
you can save your filters as a Trill in
the trainer and then paste that link
here
here I've just exported the actual drill
so that for example you can share it
with friends but you could also paste
the URL if you just want to dive in
yourself
I've noted the filter percentage so this
indicates what percentage of flops this
applies to and
this indicates the primary flop strategy
and some notes Here
and again this is flexible if you want
to find a different way that's fine
now things like stack depth become a lot
more important for example in mtts where
the strategy can change quite a bit
between 100 big blinds and 10 big blinds
right so it's important to note stuff
like this down
and similar story in spins now note that
sometimes I'll put something like early
position versus big blind and sometimes
I'll use exact spots like small blind
versus button three bet parts right
there's a ton of different heuristics we
can try out here now again I'm going to
share this spreadsheet with you guys uh
just as an empty template so you guys
can fill it out yourself and build your
own heuristics this lecture is about
teaching the man how to fish rather than
giving them the fish
I'm not going to tell you how you should
simplify right that's up to you I've got
a whole video on the trade-offs between
complexity and simplification you can go
watch the efficient studying video if
that's interesting to you but the truth
is that a lot of these heuristics we've
covered so far they are one sizing or
check right very very basic but your
heuristics can get much more complex and
so something I've added here are called
textures to try out and this is based on
Monker generated textures the way Monker
does this is it looks for flops that
result in strategically similar hand
categories based on their their Equity
distribution by the river
at least that's how my colleague
explained it to me
and you can choose how many different
textures you want and so for example all
of these flaps would be considered one
texture all of those flops would be
considered one texture and this is based
on a range of any two cards
some of these are really strong some of
these will produce very strategically
similar strategies some of them not so
much right it really depends on the spot
you're looking at because these monkey
textures just assume a range of any two
cards they're not designed for some
specific set of ranges right and that's
why sometimes it can be
really strong and other times not so
much
so I've got three of them here 30
textures which are quite coarse 60 and
then 100 which are quite fine so you can
scroll through these play around with
them and use them as inspiration to look
for new heuristic again I want to make
sure that this lecture is available for
all users so it shouldn't just be for
cash as I said if you play mtts if you
play spins you can also use this method
so let's start with a few empty tea
Spots I'm going to switch over to MTT
now Gotta Give the 20 players some love
can't all be cash
right
and let me go look up some heuristics
I've already found here
just to be a bit lazier so
let's for example apply
early position versus big blind so we'll
say maybe under the gun first big blind
now the first thing to note actually is
that under the gun and under the gun
plus one strategy very similar you know
two percent difference and the same with
big blinds calling range very similar so
you can group some of these early
positions together and just call it you
know most of your heuristics for one
will apply to the other right
um you don't have to be that exact
again I can just click reports or press
four to go to the reports tab
check
Okay so
in tournaments due to the ante big blind
must call much wider and that's going to
result in a huge range inequality on
most flops that causes under the gun to
range bets right we can see here across
all flops under the gun only checking
about 12 percent of the time but that's
a little misleading because on a lot of
flops it's a range bet and on other
flops it's a high frequency check so
let's try to isolate where we should be
checking a lot right I'm going to start
by just sorting by high card and okay
okay so we can already see
I know these five through nine boards
are the ones that are just checking a
ton right
so let's apply a very simple filter
right
again I'm noticing that
these boards are all range bets Ace
through ten
so very simply
I'm going to plug in Ace through 10
and we can see the betting frequency is
already up to almost 100 percent right
let's go look other heuristics in here
and okay we noticed that there are some
spots where
not range betting so let's organize this
by the most checked boards
and notice that in this spot it's all of
these paired boards
specifically
no just mostly paired boards all right
well let's go back to grouping
and let's sort by pairing
and again we can see paired boards in
this spot are doing the most checking
right so this is kind of backwards from
what you might see that's an MTT as a
cash player I should say so let's play
another filter here again we've got one
Broadway card and not paired
or tripled I guess you can also plug in
tripled
okay
and now
very very high frequency range bet
and I would already say that these
boards are strategically similar at
least for the first node right at least
in the sense that you basically range
betting
now you can get more specific you can
break it down by which boards will be
betting large run which ones are we
betting smaller on
um but for at least the C bet node
you've already identified a very simple
heuristic
unpaired with a Broadway card
early position versus big blind
essentially a range bet
for the first note right that's a very
easy heuristic to remember and if we go
to table you can see that this applies
to 66 percent of flops so two-thirds of
the time you already have your first
action just automated right
so let's go back here
and again
we're going to type this in so we've got
early position versus big blind 30 big
blinds effective Ace through 10 and not
paired 66 and let's type in what our
primary flop strategies are so it's a
range bet in position right so let's go
on to spins and do one more example
there and then to end off the lecture
I'll show you uh how you can create your
own drills using these filters so
got to give the spin players some love
I'll just use the 25
big blind Stacks we'll say button opens
big blind calls
and we'll just click flops to open up
the reports
I'll go to chart mode which is how I
prefer to look at stuff and let's
ungroup this so
now we see all the batch sizes right
all right so
let's go back action
not a whole lot of donk bedding we could
do something that
captures the Donk bets but we've already
done something like that so let's try
something else let's try for example
which boards are large betting more
often
so we'll check
here we can see that button splits up
their strategy with lots of small sizes
and sometimes sometimes using these
bigger sizes so
what I want to do instead of splitting
it up into eight things is group it
together a bit so I want to isolate
these larger bets right
and again in order to sort group sizes
you need to switch over to table mode
and here I'm going to sort by bet large
which boards are betting large all right
well it appears that 9 and 10 high flops
rainbow Lush draw and we'll notice that
all of these have an open Ender by the
looks of it right
openender middling cards
not really seeing any monotone boards in
here okay let's go over the grouping to
see if we can find some patterns there
so connectedness
connected boards tend to be betting
large more often same with openenders
dry disconnected boards tend to bets use
a smaller bet size okay good to know
what about pairing
well
paired boards size down so we don't want
it to be paired and what about suits
monitoring boards size down we don't
want that all right so we already got
some filters here so let's make it kind
of draw heavy
something like that so again
a flush dry helps open-ended or
connected helps
and let's take a look
at the charts
and just scroll through the flops here
all right so already we're seeing a lot
more larger bets within our set of
heuristics but it's not super clean
right
like Jack ate Deuce even though you know
an open Ender is possible it's actually
quite try
so let's try
something else
let's try
filtering by putting more middling cards
in there so
I'm going to take
I want to make sure that the bottom two
cards are kind of middling right
just as an idea
these actually result in more medium
boards okay okay
I'm going to sort this by high cards and
this is basically my process right like
I am actively discovering these Trends
with you as we go through this right
and so it looks like for example Ace
Jack high so let's apply
those two and we've got kind of a
heuristic here for larger bet sizes
right we're betting medium or large more
than we're betting small in these spots
so very simply when the board is more
draw heavy more connected you've got
some more of these mid-ling cards open
Enders maybe flush draws possible that's
when you want to start sizing up right
and of course you can improve this and
make it cleaner you can make it more
strategically similar but remember the
goal is often times to abstract the
larger Theory and when you do this
enough you start to develop your own
ideas of which boards want to size up
for what reasons so it's not just about
memorization it's about trying to find
those underlying uh cause effect
mechanisms that make the thing want to
size up now I've already done a video on
my theories behind seabed sizing and why
certain textures prefer certain sizings
you can go watch that video on YouTube
this one's more about how to find these
Trends so for example you can group a
lot of these ACE middle middle cards
together these boards are very
strategically similar you can do the
same thing for a lot of these King High
boards right very strategically similar
despite the fact that it's splitting
between small and large sizings they're
still very strategically similar
I want to go over one last thing before
I wrap this up
and that is
how to take these heuristics that you've
built and train so firstly you want to
use the turn reports right now let's try
something here I'm going to open
ace86
and so our heuristic now is going to be
ACE middle middle card right these
boards typically start sizing up the
deny draw equity
but they're also mixing smaller bets now
in order to get good at this you can use
a combination of finding thresholds
through filtering you can also use turn
reports so instead of picking one turn
if you have premium click turns and you
try and find reports
here we can already see that for example
an eighth or a six or even an Ace any
paired card really we just look at
pairing going to be a high frequency
dock bet by the big plane and that's
because big blind has more pairs in
range after they call this large bets
right
okay so let's say bicline checks action
on button
and we can kind of break it down here so
oh we're noticing that we're kind of
sizing down a little bit on a lot of
these flush completing boards right
so let's take a look we're going to
filter by suits
and again we see the heart
when the flush completes instead of
using another big bet we go from 76 to
like 32 or 50 percent right
but when it doesn't complete we're often
going to use something closer to a
geometric size so right 72 percent 50
percent
and so you can use turn reports in this
manner
to figure out how to proceed overall
again I'm just going to change this back
to the view I prefer
so again look over here to see how your
overall strategy should be and then use
a combination of grouping and sorting to
find turn cards where the strategy
shifts you can also look at Equity
shifting runouts using the equity
distribution and I've already gone over
a lot of how the turn reports work
earlier
now
that's how you look at turns for follow
through but how do you actually play it
out
well aside from actually studying
the solutions
the other thing you need to do is
actually practice them right
so let's go ahead and practice this spot
now in the trainer what you want to do
is plug in your heuristic and let's go
change it up so let's make it cache
again
and we'll do six Max General
nl50 this time sure
and let's apply some betting filter that
we're familiar with right so
hero can be say button
the opponent can be big blind
and here's where you plug in your filter
so
what's one filter we remember well this
one I have memorized it looks something
like this so Ace Broadway brick
not monotone and again this can't be
paired this type of texture if you
recall results in high frequency over
bets and so we can practice
strategically similar textures by
plugging in these filters
and furthermore you can save these
filters so I'm going to click save
I'm going to call this over bet check
and type in some description here so
button versus big blind
over bet boards civilized pot something
any description so you can remember
what's going on
right I've got this saved as a drill now
and I can practice specifically over bet
sports right
and oh you know what I better change
that to a post-flop spot because I
forgot to do that
flop single race pot
there we go
now we're starting on the Flop on over
bed boards right
Ace Ace will often check in these spots
um sometimes not
but
either way the goal is to find
strategically similar boards
plug those textures into the trainer and
then actually practice from flop to
River to get a sense of the
follow-through in summary
firstly learn how to use the tool next
optimize to try and find strategically
similar flops that apply to a wide
enough array of flops next use some sort
of system to write it down and record
your observations and if it's not
necessarily the fact that you have a
giant spreadsheet filled out it's the
actual process of filling it out
yourself that is helpful right lastly
focus on follow through optimizing flop
sizing is not as important as actually
getting a sense to how to follow up on
tournament River a strategically similar
flops tend to play somewhat similarly on
later streets especially when they're
very similar so focus on follow through
all right that's it for the video guys I
