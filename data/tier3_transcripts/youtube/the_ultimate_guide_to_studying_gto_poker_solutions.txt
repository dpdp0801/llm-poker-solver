### TOPIC: the ultimate guide to studying gto poker solutions
hello Wizards today I'm going to 
show you how to get the most out  
of your GTO wizard subscription 
by mastering the solution browser
the purpose of today's video is to teach you guys 
how to study more effectively we're going to cut  
through the noise and learn how to analyze GTO 
Solutions effectively we're going to master the  
tools and cover some tips and tricks you can use 
to get the most out of the solution browser the  
first half of this video will focus on actually 
mastering the features in GTO wizard solution  
browser there's a lot of really cool and Niche 
features that I don't think a lot of people are  
utilizing that they really should be the second 
half of this video is going to teach you some  
tips and tricks for studying GTL Solutions 
more effectively for example we'll go over  
focusing on your range rather than your hand 
how to uncover underlying principles studying  
thresholds looking beyond the strategy clumping 
by hand class analyzing your opponent's counters  
and comparing the ranges chapter 1 mastering 
the solution browser it is imperative that  
you master your tools before you master your 
Technique so the first half of this video is  
going to be a comprehensive guide of all the 
features in the solution browser that you may  
or may not be familiar with let's get started to 
access the solution browser press the solutions  
button or select it from this menu at the top 
of the page so I'm going to start very basic  
so that everyone's included and we're going 
to get to the more Niche and complex features  
as we go along a lot of players are using GTO 
Wizard and it's their first time experiencing  
a solver and it can feel overwhelming so first 
of all let me explain what we're looking at here  
this is our overall strategy each hand is color 
coded according to its actions so for example Ace  
4 is red and that corresponds to the fact that 
it's opening nine three is blue indicating that  
it's folding our overall range frequencies are 
shown here so under the gun is opening these hands  
in red or a total of 17.6 percent of the time so 
17 percent of the range is opening and the rest  
is folding right and you can scroll through the 
positions to see how the strategy changes so let's  
say under the gun folds actions on hijack old and 
here's this button strategy maybe button opens  
bold and here's big blind strategy and now we see 
that they have some calls some raises some Folds  
so you can select any spot you want you could 
go through flops turns Rivers whatever you like  
now there's a faster way to navigate this and so 
for example let's say we wanted to pick a button  
versus big blind spots what a lot of people do 
is they'll click fold fold fold but you can just  
click button one click and big blind calls and 
that's two clicks and you've selected this spot  
or alternatively you can use this shortcut thing 
at the top left of the page and maybe we want like  
a cut off versus small blind three bet pot you 
can do it that way as well and just enter whatever  
board you'd like to see the strategy so next I 
want to show you how to choose the right solution  
now you need to click this thing in the top left 
of the page and this is the solution selector and  
this works a little differently depending on each 
of your formats so first of all I'm on Cache games  
right now I've selected the classic cash game so 
not anti-plus straddle and I've selected six Max  
firstly we can filter by Stack depth and so 
we could choose any stack depth starter users  
can access the 100 big line stack depths 
premium users have access to all of them  
next you can choose your solution type if you're 
ever confused about what this means just hover  
over these little question marks and it will 
explain it so General Solutions are versatile they  
have GTO preferred sizes they have more bed sizes 
The Simple Solutions tend to have fewer bet sizes  
they don't have for example any small blind limbs 
or four bet shoves 100 big deep and so choose your  
size or Choose Your solution as you wish next 
we have a number of different rake structures  
so we have nl50 and NL 500 and we also have these 
for GG which have pre-flop break the opening size  
corresponds to how big you open so for example 
GTO usually wants to open smaller from early  
position and bigger from late position if you want 
to know why go watch my range morphology video but  
some people just want to open 2.5 x from every 
position and that's fine we have solutions for  
that as well so select 2.5 x if that's what you 
prefer this does change the pre-flop strategies  
a bit especially what calls similarly we can 
change the three bet sizes so GTO often tends  
to three bet quite large but the smaller Free Bet 
sizes are designed to mimic the population a bit  
more so for example cutoff opens and small blind 
here is racing 10. whereas with the larger sizes  
they're going to be raising like 11.5 big 
blinds racing 13. and so what you can do is  
you can just filter for the stuff you want so 
I want 100 big lines uh General Solutions nl50  
with smaller three bed sizes right and so now 
it's showing me two solutions I can choose from  
we can also pin this using this button and press 
up and down to go through what we've selected  
and if we allow more things 
it shows us more solutions  
a lot of people they'll get confused like 
what is all this stuff you can just press  
this show preview button and from here you can see 
information about each of the spots so here we've  
selected the NL cache 50 General Solutions and 
we can see we have turn reports we can see the  
rake structure we can see the number of sizings 
the accuracy and this changes depending on what  
you select now for MTT players we've got a 
little bit of a different setup here so MTT  
players can choose between heads up chippyv and 
ICM spots so let's start with chip EV first of all  
if you check the top or the bottom right here you 
can see which spots we have pre-flop and post-flop  
solutions for this solution was just added a few 
weeks ago so right now it's pre-flop only but if  
you select the eight Max Solutions you can see 
post flop spots as well here we can choose the  
effective stack depth and we can either view it 
as a grid or a table that we can scroll through
now if you're picking ICM Solutions we have a lot 
of different pre-flop ICM solutions to choose from
at the top we see the stack type 
any near big and far and so the  
let me just move that over so near indicates 
that most of the stacks are somewhat close  
to each other big stack indicates that one or 
two players have a really big stack compared to  
the rest of the table so here under the gun has 
160 and far indicates that it's more spread out  
and this has some implications as to the ICM 
effects down here at the bottom we can see that  
we can select different tournament phases so right 
now we have final table and two table but we plan  
on adding many tournament phases including uh you 
know the last 25 percent of the field and so on  
so I recommend you check out this payouts button 
as that's going to explain the payout distribution  
among the final table here so we have right now 
one final table and two final tables and that's  
going to alter the payout structure and you 
can choose how many players are remaining so  
if we're at a final table with five players 
remaining we can go and study that as well
you can sort by any one of these columns so for 
example if you're in the cutoff and you want to  
choose a specific size you can sort and you 
can even scroll using the sidebar say we have  
40 bigs and we want to find something closed so 
we can choose something close to our spot here  
Spin and go players similarly they can choose 
between symmetric and asymmetric stack them  
symmetric means that all the stacks have the 
same size and asymmetric meaning mixed sizes  
and again you can view this either as a table 
or a grid I think spin players usually prefer  
this grid view a little easier to look at 
especially if you're studying mixed stacks  
we also have different types of solutions so for 
example the complex Solutions contain a lot more  
bet sizes and these are often used to determine 
how we should simplify into the general Solutions  
so with all that said you should know 
that you can actually pop this out into  
a separate window and for example if you 
have another monitor you could put this on  
another screen and quickly switch between 
solutions to compare and contrast them  
so let's go back to cash games I've shown 
you the basics of how to find Solutions and  
how to navigate the tree let's get into some 
of the cool features now so we'll say that  
hijack opens with this range and action on 
big blind they call with this range in green
pick any flop you'd like I'll 
select the random one for this video
big blind checks action on hijack and 
we can see this is a range bet spot  
so let's select some bet size we'll 
go half pot here action back on big  
blind okay so again we can see 
the overall strategy we can see  
the overall frequencies in this tables folding 57 
calling these hands if you click any one of these  
you apply a filter so here I'm filtering exactly 
for their folds and that filter is shown up here  
and you can either click off or just click 
the clear button if you hover over any one  
of these hands you can see their exact strategic 
breakdown so King four here is Raising sometimes  
it's calling sometimes and it's folding sometimes 
a hand like A6 maybe basically just always call  
it right and like nine five just folding 
so something else you can do is hover over  
specific actions to learn more about that race 
so for example what hands comprise the calling  
range so there's a little icon above each 
of these actions you see these little guys
these you can hover over to learn more about 
how that range is constructed so I'm going to  
hover over this icon and here we can see that 
big blind's calling range is primarily composed  
of top pair lots of asex so when you bet half 
pot with hijack just know that after one bet  
at least half their stuff is top pair right 
you can also hover over the raises so what  
type of value are they racing with and we 
can see that most of their raises in this  
spot they're just straight it's just King Jack 
and so you can use this to identify the value  
thresholds calling thresholds what hands start 
folding for example so a lot of second pair  
third pair starts folding and so these are 
a good way to see that range Construction  
so as I said you can hover over any hand to see 
what's going on we also have this summary tab now  
the summary tab shows some interesting data so we 
can see the strategy you can also see for example  
how much of it is in our range so range 
indicates the weight so Jack nine for example  
only gets here 85 percent of the time and that's 
because it's going to raise pre-flop sometimes  
we can see the expected value of this hand in big 
blinds the equity so that's how often it would win  
if it were checked out the equity realization 
and the blocker score if you have premium  
hover over this icon to learn more 
about what each of these things mean  
so what is a blocker score what is 
EV well you can learn it all here
something else you can do is use this drop 
down look at different types of data so  
what is the actual expected value of different 
decisions I'm going to select strategy plus AV  
and here for example we can see that 
Jack 8 has the same EV raising and  
calling which should be no surprise 
because it's mixing raises and calls
a hand like 96 though for example is just a minus 
EV call the highest DV action is folding and so  
it pure Folds you can look at different things so 
strategy plus equity and you can also just press  
one on your keyboard to go through this so this 
is the expected value Equity Equity realization  
lockers and the overall range weights you can also 
look at all of it at the same time so for example  
here we can see all of this stuff that we saw in 
the summary tab next I want to show you uh how you  
can customize the look and feel of GTO wizard of 
it so perhaps you don't like these colors maybe  
you're a little colorblind maybe you just don't 
like the general Vibe it's fully customizable  
select your settings in the top right corner here 
and customize your colors to your heart intense we  
have a lot of different themes you can pick from 
on the right here so maybe you like this Ice Cold  
theme or maybe the homage thing maybe oh the data 
pick a theme that's a pretty popular one make it  
your own now you can also customize it yourself 
so you can choose for example exactly what color  
a check should be the color gradient for like a 
medium bet or a large bet you can change pretty  
much everything in here what are your cards look 
like what do the suits look like what is the text  
and background look like make it your own and 
you can even Import and Export themes among  
Frets something else you can do is change the way 
the range is viewed so for example you can select  
range height or full height now full height just 
means that everything's rescaled to maximum so for  
example A6 here it looks like we have this hand in 
full when in fact we only have it 19 of the time  
and so if you go to normalize it rescales it 
right so I prefer the normalized view and I  
strongly suggest you use this too because 
that way you won't be looking at a hand  
like ding six thinking it's impactful when in 
fact it's a very tiny part of the range right  
something else that I really like and you know 
what I'm even going to switch to a two-tone  
board for this one is this horizontal view this 
one is one of my favorites so horizontal View  
changes the way your range is displayed in 
the strategy Matrix and so each combination  
is displayed separately so for example we can 
immediately see these Diamond draws inside calling  
so nine five we see that there's one column 
those are the diamonds and the rest are folding
similarly we can see for example  
just at a glance that the king X and the queen X 
are only calling when they have this diamond here
so this one's really useful for boards or 
suits matter the vertical view I think is  
better for rainbow boards but choose what you 
like now if you're ever confused about what  
all of this means again we have these little 
helper buttons so just click help and you can  
understand what's going on here so next I want 
to show you probably what is my favorite feature  
in GTO wizard solution browser and these 
are these filters oh I absolutely love the  
filters so the filters allow you to filter and 
highlight different hand classes in your range  
so for example if I hover over top pair it 
highlights the top pair and if I click this
it applies a hand class filter I should say 
and so now we see that these Global frequencies  
are also updated and so if I click two pair for 
example we can see the two pair is mostly calling  
and straights are mostly raising you can 
also use these little arrow keys so if I  
just click for example up now I've selected all 
of the two pair and better and if I click down  
now I've only selected in between what I've 
clicked and again little filters come up here  
so something you can do for example is Click 
let's say arrays and we're filtering for hands  
within this phrase let's click both phrases 
and we can use these Equity bucket filters  
so Equity buckets tell you how strong your hand 
is compared to your opponent's range so what's  
the value portion of these check raises well if I 
click the best hands we can immediately see it's  
pocket tens a bottom set and straights okay what 
is the bluff portion of these check raises I'll  
select trash hands and maybe some weekends and we 
can see here it's a whole lot of Jack X and King  
X these gut shots uh particularly with a diamond 
indicating that we have also the flush draw right  
so another really useful feature of wizard is the 
ability to group bed sizes together for example  
here we see that the solution is mixing between a 
half pot rays and a full pot raise but what if we  
don't actually care about that distinction well 
we have this ability to group actions together  
so I'm going to click simple and here it mixes 
between raise call and full now this doesn't  
actually change the solution it just changes the 
way it's displayed and so all of our raises are  
now bucketed together as one Ray size and this 
can be really helpful for spots where there's a  
lot of bet sizes and you want to simplify it now 
you can use this drop down or just press s we also  
have this chart mode this is kind of fun you can 
see for example a graph of the betting frequencies  
we've got the main ones that moves off 
but we also have these grouped sizes right
below this we have another switch for the filters 
and there's a difference between full length and  
range length and so full length just displays 
each column to its fullest whereas range length  
rescales it as to how many of these hands you 
actually have in range so we have more two pair  
therefore this bar is longer than this bar and 
I like that because it gives me an idea of what  
proportion of hand glasses are in my range right 
another useful feature is the ability to toggle  
between big lines and percentage pot you can 
just press the space bar to switch you can  
even display both at the same time alternatively 
you can change these in your settings under other
all right that about wraps it up for the strategy 
tab but there's a number of other tabs here I want  
to show you so let's move on to the ranges 
tab next the ranges tab is super powerful  
I really like this tab so you'll probably see a 
screen like this and first of all we can compare  
both ranges at the same time now you can full 
screen it using this button or by pressing Q
and the main thing is that we can 
compare for example different hand  
classes so we can highlight who has more 
straights or sets or two pair or top pair  
we can also compare things like the expected 
value of both ranges or the equity of both ranges  
and you can also copy the strategies at this point 
so I can copy this to my clipboard and paste it  
into my favorite poker tools similarly I could 
copy this one and here it's big blinds action  
so I can copy a specific node so for example I 
could copy just their calling range or just their  
folding range in the center we see combinations 
that's the number of combinations in either  
player's range on the left big blind on the right 
hijack and it's always out of position in position  
we see the expected value so obviously 
uh hijack has an advantage on this board  
especially after the bets we can see the 
equity the equity realization as well as  
a breakdown below between the hand classes now 
you can compare Equity buckets hands and draws  
so Equity buckets for example is how much 
Equity you have against your opponent's range  
we also have these finer Equity buckets 
with more categories and these are good  
for getting a sense of the overall range and not 
advantages as well as the polarity of the spot  
and classes are also quite fun clicking any one 
of these applies a filter so for example if I  
click a few of these now I'm filtering the 
top pair and two pair in both players ranges  
and there's a little thing at the very top 
these little things in white tiers so 33  
and 21 this means that overall 21 of big blinds 
range contains a two pair or a top pair whereas  
33 percent of hijacks range contains these 
heads again we can just clear our filters here
now below this we see this Equity distribution 
graph you can full screen this to get a better  
look at it this is a good way to quickly 
visualize the nothing range advantages  
so this green line is hijack and this blue line 
is big blind and you can change the color of  
these lines in your settings but what we notice 
here is that hijack is way ahead of big blind  
and this indicates that they have a big big range 
advantage when I stop at any one of these spots so  
for example right here we can see on the x-axis 
the strength of our hand within our own range  
and on the y-axis the strength of our hand against 
our opponent's range so for example right in the  
middle hijack's middling hand is Queen jack off 
suit which has decent Equity against big blind  
big blind's middling hand is Jack nine which is 
pretty far behind and by superimposing them like  
this we can get a quick view of what's going on 
you can also highlight to zoom in so for example  
if we just want to see like the range event or 
like the The Nutty hands we can do that as well  
and clicking anything in here puts little dots 
that show which hands you've selected so if we  
just select these nutted hands each one of these 
dots represents a combination in either player's  
wrench now the ranges tab is most powerful 
because you can use it to compare the range  
asymmetries and from there you can use it to 
figure out why different strategies are preferred  
so something else you guys should check out 
is this breakdown tab now the breakdown tab  
shows you a summary of all the hand glasses 
in your player's range so here we're looking  
at big blind and this is similar to the filters 
tab except we have more graphs and stuff right  
so here we can see how many of each of these 
hand categories straight sets two pair different  
types of draws and such are in our range and 
that's shown under this range percentage here  
you can see the number of combinations present as 
well as what these hand categories prefer so we  
can see obviously straights like the razelot and 
hands like low pairs are just pure folding we can  
also apply bedding filters so I if I just select 
these raised sizes notice that this represented  
column changes and so this shows me the overall 
range construction of our check race and we can  
see again our check raise is mostly constructed 
using ands like straights and sets and two pair  
and such right this is going to be the the value 
portion of our arrays and the Bluffs lots of combo  
draws right at the bottom of the page we see this 
all combo summary and this is uh kind of a fun  
way to visualize the polarity so here we can see 
what hands start folding what hands are calling  
what hands are raising in this beautiful little 
Manhattan graph and it's interesting because  
it's sorted by equity so we can see that for 
example some high Equity hands for example Ace  
8 here is actually folding and you know what 
I'm going to change this from strategy to all  
so this hand has 53 equity and yet some low 
Equity hands so for example King six here  
this hand has way less Equity but it's pure race 
and that's likely because you have the king of  
diamonds and so you can outdraw your opponent's 
range whereas A6 is going to be dominated by a  
lot of hijacks right we can also visualize the 
polarity notice that there's a lot of red here  
that's our value and there are some Bluffs along 
here right and the more polar you get the more of  
that spread and the fewer of these middling hands 
will be present so it'll spread out between value  
and Bluffs in the aggressive lines we also have 
aggregate reports now I've already put out a  
video on aggregate reports these are so cool these 
allow you to view the strategy across all possible  
flops you can use it to find for example betting 
heuristics you can group you can filter I'm not  
going to go into it in this one because I've just 
put out a video on it but do check that out these  
are very very powerful tools to get a better 
sense of what's going on and build heuristics  
let's go back for a second one hockey you should 
be aware of is that you can quickly switch between  
these four tabs using one two three and four and 
again all of the hotkeys are in your settings here  
so all right here if you forget some 
of them are customizable as well  
something else I should mention is that you 
can filter by suits so for example right  
here I can filter by suit I could filter for 
just the diamond draws for example or just the  
backdoor Spades I can also do that in the 
filters tab as well a few more shortcuts  
you should be aware of you can reset 
the history by pressing this button  
and that's just going to take you back there 
or press G you can save the solution so if  
you find a spot you like press this save 
button type in some notes spot to study  
save it and you could come back to it later 
and this is a great way for for example if your  
coach you can save your spots like this reopen 
it that way we can also edit and reapply it
you can jump directly to practice mode pressing 
this button and that's going to allow you to grind  
whatever spot you're looking at practice against 
the solution and this allows you to collapse  
and expand this spot for smaller screens so that's 
mostly it to the solution browser now that you  
understand how to use it let's move on to some 
tips now that you've learned all of the features  
in the solution browser I'm going to give you guys 
some tips and tricks for studying GTO Solutions  
more effectively now if you've seen my efficient 
studying video you'll know that I promote a big  
picture approach a lot of people when they go into 
Solutions they're trying to memorize stuff and  
they get overwhelmed by all the possibilities 
and the thing is you shouldn't be trying to  
memorize arbitrary frequencies you should be 
looking for the bigger picture so focusing on  
your range rather than your hand looking at 
thresholds comparing the range asymmetries  
comparing Solutions and overall just trying 
to uncover these underlying principles that  
actually drive your strategy that's my Approach 
not to say that memorizing is particularly wrong  
it's just limited in how much you can actually do 
right there's too many spots so without further  
Ado let's move on to the first tip so my next 
tip is to try and uncover underlying principles  
the purpose of studying GTO in my opinion 
is to uncover the underlying cause effect  
relationships that drive good strategy let me say 
that one more time because it's really important  
we want to figure out why rather than what we want 
to know the reason behind betting this hand rather  
than this hand is betting if that makes sense 
and so solution browsers and GTO they give us  
the answer but they don't really tell us why and 
uncovering Y is important because once you know  
why you can then apply it to a much wider range 
of situations you can take that same principle and  
apply it to boards that you're unfamiliar with and 
this helps you hone your strategy faster and more  
effectively my next tip is to study thresholds now 
I have talked about thresholds in so many videos  
by efficient studying 10 tips for newer poker 
players as well as a bunch of Articles at Daily  
doses but it's just such a low hanging fruit 
that you really should be aware of so studying  
thresholds is the art of asking questions that 
shape your range so for example where's the bottom  
of my range where's my continuation threshold and 
once you know where your continuation threshold  
is you know what's close and you know what's a 
snap fold and what's always continuing right so  
if you know that second pair is never ever folding 
then you know that top pair is never folding for  
example right and so studying these thresholds 
involves asking questions like what hand classes  
start folding against this bet size what hands 
can raise for value or double barrel value and  
what draws are just never folding here so I 
won't go too much in depth because I've covered  
this in so many videos but let me just give you 
a quick example of how I like to study thresholds
so this time I'm using a spin and Go Solution 
again these principles apply to all formats it  
doesn't matter what you play cache MTT spins 
this is going to apply to you so button folds  
small blind opens big blind calls and 
the Flop is Jack eighth Deuce two-tone  
small blind best 25 percent action on big blind 
now when some people look at this they're going  
to be a little bit confused because there's so 
many hands doing so many things what's going on so  
what I do is I click this filters Tab and first 
thing I look at are these thresholds here so  
where is my indifference threshold for folding 
well it's about ace high right and how do I know  
that because there's a little bit of blue there 
and so if I simply filter for everything above  
ace high we can see it's never folding and so I 
already know that against this size I'm not going  
to be folding a made hand right similarly 
with my draws I'm not folding a draw here  
what about my value threshold well we can hover 
over this little icon and we should look at that  
our value threshold is top pair and so we know 
approximately what hands are raising per value  
where the continuation lines are and this is 
important because it sculpts your strategy  
so my next tip is to look beyond the strategy 
most people when they study GTO Solutions are  
only paying attention to the strategy and it's 
sometimes difficult to determine why it's doing  
what it's doing if you only look at the strategy 
as we've shown earlier there are a lot of other  
metrics you can use you can look at EV expected 
value Equity realization blockers we can try and  
find indifference thresholds we can look at 
pod odds there's a lot of different metrics  
you can look at and strategy is only one of 
them so make sure to utilize the tools GTO  
wizard has to offer to help you understand 
what's going on let me show you an example  
so this time I've selected an nl50 cache game 100 
big blind state cut off opens small blind three  
bets to 10 actions on us back in the cutoff 
here we can see it's folding 63 of the time  
and now let's compare this to a different 
solution and so this one uses a slightly larger  
GTO optimized three batch sizes small blind three 
bets to 11.5 instead now notice what happens to  
our overall defending frequency when we switch 
between these two it's a huge difference right  
and so people will then post in the Discord 
why is it so much different aren't these two  
sizes basically the same but the answer is 
no they're not because most of your hands  
are very close to zero EV and so if you only 
look at the strategy this may seem confusing  
but let's take a look at the expected value of 
the overall ratio and we can see that basically  
regardless of what size they bet only the very top 
of your range has any real value most of the rest  
of it is just mixed in different Bluff catches 
to prevent small blind from exploiting you and  
so if we look at strategy plus EV we'll notice 
that all of these hands are very close to zero  
if you calculate your pot odds facing these two 
different Ray sizes 11.5 versus 10. you'll note  
that there is actually a fairly I won't say huge 
but at least a significant difference between your  
pod odds facing these two sizes and so we can 
see with the evmetric alone that most of the  
range is already very close so this is what 
I mean when I say utilize more than just the  
strategy tab there's a whole lot more going on in 
here that you can get into it can be very helpful  
to understand what's going on so my next tip is to 
Clump by hand class so this process involves using  
filters to look at one set of hand classes at a 
time and comparing contrasting the strategies in  
this way we can try to find why certain things 
are happening and we can also change the board  
in the runouts to see how the strategy with that 
hand class changes this is a nice powerful tool we  
can use to get insight into what's going on let 
me show you how this works so we've got another  
cash game spot here cutoff opens big blind calls 
and the Flop is ace55 Rainbow so let's take a  
look at one specific type of hand and I'm going 
to choose the under pairs because they're kind  
of nice to look at and so what's the difference 
between these hands right they're always going to  
be between top pair and trips but we notice that 
Kings is checking a lot whereas six are betting  
more often so why is it that the lower under pairs 
are betting more often than the higher under pairs  
and hopefully this should be obvious to some 
of you guys the answer is simply vulnerability  
so for example when you bet pocket 
sixes you're making them fold  
7x 8X 9x 10x Jack X but when you bet pocket kings 
I mean are you really did you gain much when you  
made them fold their Jack eight no like you could 
have just checked it back let him hit a jack on  
the turn gotten money that way and so there's 
value to fold Equity but it's relative to your  
hand and this is something I talked about in my 
first lecture for Wizard the value of fold equity  
now let's change the board and see if 
this heuristic still applies so let's  
ace4 and we're going to take a look at the under 
Pairs and lo and behold it's still there right  
the kings are checking more than the 
fives and we see a nice gradient here  
okay well let's change it up a 
bit what about a is three three  
and again filter for under pairs same 
heuristic right you see this actually in  
quite a lot of boards so let's try something 
else let's try checking through to the turn  
and we're going to put let's say a six and in fact 
I'm going to make it a six of Hearts just because  
I want it to be rainbow and I'm going to make it 
vertical View big blind checks action on cut off  
so let's pick another hand class to 
study let's go with top here this time  
how does our betting frequency with top pair 
change on different turn cards so there's a  
few ways we can go about this you could 
just pick different turn cards you could  
look reports another cool feature is you can 
use hotkeys so I'm going to click shift left  
and notice that this increments the turn 
card so at seven it's an eight it's a nine  
it's a 10 and notice what's happening to our top 
pair here it's starting to bet more and more and  
more why is that why do we get to bet more top 
hair when for example there's a queen on board  
and so this is where you start making 
your hypothesis now my hypothesis is that  
we have enough of these Queen X hands that they 
act as protection for the worst Bluff catchers  
in our range that want to get The Showdown 
and so that frees up our top pair to bet more  
aggressively whereas if we compare this to say 
like six of hearts for example we can't really  
do that as much right and so in this case I think 
that you can scroll through the strategy or use  
turn reports to try and compare how different 
runouts affect different portions of your range  
so my last tip is also my best tip if you stuck 
around this far congratulations you get the little  
pot of gold at the end of the tunnel and that 
tip is to compare the ranges and this is just so  
absurdly powerful people are not using the ranges 
tab enough uh the range of symmetries reveal most  
of the reasons behind the strategies this is 
because you can pair you can compare things like  
which hand classes hits who has more of what what 
are what's the polarity by looking at the equity  
buckets and let me show you just a quick exercise 
you can do to try and hone in on your flop  
heuristics a bit so I've picked a spin and go spot 
here we're going to keep it simple button opens  
big blank calls and instead of picking a flop I'm 
going to go straight to the ranges tab and we're  
going to filter for calls so now we see what hands 
big blind is calling with so let's try and pick a  
flop where button is going to have an advantage 
so for example what does big blind not have well
they don't have any of the pocket pairs we're 
going to look at the offsuit stuff like they  
don't have Jack three they don't have like 
n595 so what about a board like nine five  
dupes something like that so they don't have any 
of these sets obviously and they don't have nine  
five or five deuce or nine dues and so they they 
don't have a lot of these two pair any of his sets  
uh whereas we're still hitting all of this top 
pair and we still have all of these over pairs  
so I fear yeah I feel like nine five dudes 
is gonna be a very aggressively bad board  
just looking at the range comparison tab here so 
let's plug it in so big line calls nine five deuce
big line checks action on button and wowzers that 
is a lot of big betting for a spin go so yeah just  
betting pot 75 betting often and betting large uh 
taking advantage of the fact that a big blind just  
doesn't have any of the nutted hands in range to 
counter these large bets and also taking advantage  
of the fact that we can immediately fold out a 
lot of over cards to our top pair such as all  
of these Jack 10 king queen ace cards right and 
so this is the power of the range comparison tab  
use it to compare hand classes use it compare 
Equity buckets like here we can see for example  
they just don't have any of these best hands 
in range because we cherry pick this spot  
and that's obviously going to lead to these more 
polarized strategies especially on a board with  
as much old Equity as 9-5 news all right that's 
it for the video guys I hope you enjoyed it hope
