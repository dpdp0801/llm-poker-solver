### TOPIC: turn the tables mastering turn probes in srp
hi Wizards my name is Manuel better 
known as Fimo in the poker world I am  
a high stakes MTT player and coach and 
I recently joined the GTO wizard team  
in my sessions I will explore GTO strategies 
with you and break down the mechanics in an  
implementable way to help you improve your 
win rate at the tables I hope to see many  
of you guys in my live seminars let's 
get to the next level together [Music]  
first of all I want to give you a little bit of an 
overview what to expect today we will first of all  
try to understand when the spot actually happens 
in Game in theory how ranges are composed when  
we get to this node and how ranges are going to 
change as well on the turn when the turn card is  
being dealt then we will look at brief Concepts 
at play nothing special probably stuff that  
you have heard already quite often and the most 
important thing we will actually try to understand  
the mechanics on different turn clusters how 
strategies change and function on on different  
turns um depending on the board structure and then 
we will briefly Summit up with a conclusion and  
Outlook um what we've learned during the session 
hopefully and what you have to keep in mind when  
you study the spot yourself but also what you can 
expand on when you want to deepen your knowledge  
further in the spot because of course uh you can 
always only cover so much in the one hour coaching  
and there's very much to explore in these turns 
and River nodes so just briefly when does the  
spot happen of course when we when we look at 
turn probes um it is a necessity that the Flop  
went check check and that happens more often when 
the ranges are wider especially the inp position  
range here I have compared two frequencies 
two aggregated frequencies 40bb scenarios once  
button big plant versus Under the Gun and big 
plant versus the button and you can see that  
under the gun checks much less than the button 
just because the range Equity of the under the  
gun player is much higher this is just a general 
mechanic in MTT poer because uh with the pre flop  
odds the big plan is always getting the big 
plan ranges react a little bit more lazy but  
then in position ranges the race first in ranges 
and therefore imbalance let's call it between  
equities gets a little bit bigger when the race 
comes from early positions so and when the under  
the gun player has more Equity he can bet more 
often so it's going to go check check less often  
but also in wide range scenarios and the mechanics 
are also more interesting because there's wider  
range of hands available to play and that always 
is a better example in my opinion to understand  
strategies well so here we can see the button 
checks 25% approximately globally 40bb button  
big plan doesn't really change to too much for 
different stack sizes as a global percentage I  
think but it is very dependent on the actual board 
structure and there are very specific boards where  
there's a lot of checking and many boards where 
there's no checking at all and seeding itself can  
probably fill at least another coaching so I need 
to cut a few things a little bit short today but  
I still briefly want to give you an impression 
how to identify nodes where where uh starting is  
worth it one big driver and we will actually look 
at an example for the hand selection in a minute  
as well but one big driver for the in position 
range especially Sports where in position has a  
lot of medium strength hands and one thing that 
is important to understand both on the Flop and  
on the Toyon when you have a medium strong hand 
and you invest a bed and therefore let the other  
guy react that always means the responding range 
is becoming a little bit tighter weak hands are  
going to fold and when you start out with a medium 
wrong hand and you bet uh ranges are going to get  
tighter and then your Equity is actually getting 
lower and that could potentially be a problem  
usually it's a bit more of an issue when you are 
out of position or in certain boards but something  
to keep in mind so not every hand is interested in 
betting then sometimes the board is just very very  
good from a range perspective for the big plant my 
example for that would be 765 rainbow I called it  
fair equity for out of position because big play 
is never going to have a a huge amount of equity  
in big play defense spots especially not against 
the button or actually also not against an earlier  
position but usually he not going to pass 50% 
Equity very often um just because he has so many  
hands that don't connect with any given flop and 
then the third big factor is a top range Advantage  
for the out of position player for the big plan 
that is not very uh frequently happening but on  
paired boards with a bottom pair flop for example 
where the big plant has many more combinations  
of the trips that are available so these are 
important as well so let's quickly touch on Range  
composition and after that we will have a look in 
GTO wizard um how the BS actually look like and  
how how ranges function on this Sports so when we 
want to give the in position range something like  
a headline we can call it condensed and now when 
we think about turn play uh we could actually I  
I think it's pretty helpful to think about the 
spot as it would be played in live poker because  
they the game is a little bit slower and we can 
understand what actually happens a bit better when  
the big blind checks the Flop he kind of makes a 
statement with his range he says I didn't want to  
lead at least my hand or my range doesn't want to 
lead but the statement is not very strong because  
in most scenarios big plane will not have a 
leading range but it's a little bit of a statement  
however when when he checks when in position 
checks that's defining ranges much more and that's  
what I call condensed here condensed means the top 
and the bottom is missing so we are now talking  
about the range that is more centered around the 
middle medium strength hands of the inos player  
and in life poker it's very well to observe when 
inos checks now the dealer is going to tap the  
table going to burn a card and that is actually a 
very good moment to think about range compositions  
in this scenario because now ranges are defined 
on a way and the turn can change them again but  
at this particular moment we can observe ranges 
and that's what I'm trying to do here and at this  
moment in positions range is condensed because he 
has B most of his strong hands some of his Bluffs  
but especially the medium strength hands that I 
talked about on the last slide already are the  
ones interested in checking the most so his range 
is built very much around made hands like hands  
that are a pair but smaller than top pair so a lot 
of second pair type hands third pair type hands  
under Pockets things like that the other hand 
category that falls into this cluster is what I  
call showd downable Air so these are usually going 
to be ace high hands strong King High hands that  
have decent Equity right now like 40 50% maybe and 
then the concept I talked about in the beginning  
kicks in when you now start betting you trim 
down big plan's range a little bit and your hand  
is going to suffer inequity again which is kind 
potentially be problematic still having to play  
a Turnal River but then again we're in position so 
it's not that drastic more of a choice that we can  
make as the inos player Whenever there are range 
splits especially between betting and checking  
then draws usually are present in almost all the 
ranges just to have board coverage and all the Run  
outs um but also because there are draws that have 
uh bigger incentive to do one of the two things  
so there's also going to be a variet of draws 
in the imposition range and some strong hands  
for protection usually ones that cover the board 
quite a lot so they block a lot of the continue  
range from the big light top sets is a typical 
example um but it also depends a little bit on  
the specific board structure in any case the in 
position range is condensed when it checks the  
Flop but there is no turn cut yet big BL range as 
I said is rather undefined most often it's going  
to be just the full pre flop defense range he 
calls pre flop checks range on the Flop so nothing  
is really said yet but on some boards it's going 
to have leads as well and Boards like 765 rainbow  
are perfect example but still usually the ranges 
are going to be built in a way where the remainder  
the checking range is uh still kind of reflective 
of the full range that he has preflop so big  
blind's range is rather under def find at this 
particular moment the am asking question um High  
monotone boards I guess the question is in the 
check cluster because the big plant has a flush  
Advantage I think yeah there are usually boards 
that have a lot of equity shifts which monotone  
boards are one of always checked to some degree 
but I usually try to focus on the more frequent  
scenarios when when I start studying a spot or 
start coaching a spot because it's just more  
impactful what you can take away from in monotone 
BS are just relatively rare So I um rather try  
to ignore them in the first step at least but we 
can have a follow up on more exotic spots in the  
future for sure so two uh classic examples of the 
check boards are going to be BS like high mid mid  
two connected cars that connect very well with the 
big blindes the bottom ones and then boards like  
973 rainbow the typical thing about this board is 
that there are gut shots between the cards which  
are more present in the big BL range because he 
has more offsuit combinations but as I said we  
need to be a little bit careful not to dive too 
deep into the Flop strategy today so just briefly  
exploring one example the queen 86 flash drawboard 
to understand the Flop check ranges first of all  
we can see that button checks around 50% here 
which is relatively typical usually you will have  
a hard time to find B where the button is going to 
check more than 50% The Only Exception would be if  
you had BS like 765 rainbow and would forbid the 
big blind to lead then check frequencies are going  
to surpass the 50% Benchmark quite significantly 
if not this is around the maximum check frequency  
appro approximately you will find and then looking 
at the equity craft here I think is very helpful  
to understand why there is a bunch of checks 
because in contrast to black 765 Rainbow on Queen  
86 having a check range is more of a decision 
for the button you could simplify a strategy  
to a relatively small bet that would lose very 
little EV but could bet at a very high frequency  
not pure but probably something like 80 85% you 
could do that but the GTO solution doesn't really  
think it's the best idea and the main reason are 
first of all that the in position player is going  
to have a lot of hands that are in the let's call 
it 50% cluster as I said in reality it's more like  
40 to 50 40 to 55 but these kind of hands are not 
really interested in making ranges tighter yet but  
rather retaining the equity realizing in a smaller 
pot but it is usually never one single factor that  
drives these mechanics here we have a second one 
and that is that the big blind range has very  
very little absolute autof folds so not too 
many super low Equity hands that are going to  
always want to fold against a small bed uh so 
these factors kind of play together and make  
it a board where we want to check a little bit 
as the inos player and 973 rainbow works very  
similarly actually most of the boards work very 
similarly and then when we look at the check range  
uh from the button we can see that a lot of the 
green hands are going to be in the pair section  
as I said and then there's a little bit of 
top pair checking as well that's more of a  
protection play but the main hand categories that 
want to check are going to be pairs that are lower  
than the top pair itself and then when we look 
at um ace high and King High hands we can also  
see that the worse kind of King High hands and the 
worse ace high hands want to bet a little bit more  
compared to the stronger hands that could maybe 
more intuitively be understood as Show downable  
air as I called it and you can also see the 
equities here they are usually in the 40 to  
50% percentile all right so I think uh that shows 
pretty well how the in position range is going  
to be constructed very condensed trimmed down 
around hands that have decent Equity right now  
but not necessarily stronger than top pair then 
briefly checking on the concepts that play one  
very important thing is of course position we are 
looking at the big plan strategy today um playing  
the turn first in and we are out of precision and 
that is something very important to keep in mind I  
will touch on a few examples where it plays or how 
the role it plays manifests in the strategies it  
always plays a role of course and then as always 
Equity play a role but um there are two or three  
different equities we can have a look at in this 
scenario first of all the range Equity how is our  
range um all of our hands going to do at all and 
usually when you have a stronger range a higher  
range Equity uh we are going to bet more often 
and we will see in examples later how exactly that  
works why it is and what kind of hands it affects 
the most another Equity we need to consider is  
the nut Equity the equity of the very strongest 
hands in the range and uh there it's important to  
understand two things who has more of these hands 
and does one of the players have them exclusively  
so more of these hands um usually is going to 
be yeah depending on the board structure like  
when you have very high turns for example we will 
see that later the inos players going to hit them  
more often and so one pair hands can be the nuts 
or we can have a straight completer where a lot  
of two pairs and Straits are possible that maybe 
the big plant has more because it's a low board  
and or it could be a high board where let's 
say for example on Queen 88867 something like  
that or queen 869 and the imposition will player 
will also have hands like check 10 will also turn  
more two pairs than on 7654 and therefore it also 
depends if one player has the nuts exclusively or  
if both players have them when we look at turn 
props we also need to consider that in GTO the  
in position player is also going to have some 
traps so usually we need to consider the top 10  
to 15% of the range the nut Equity part because in 
many scenarios in positions traps from the flope  
will still be the best hands um on the turn but 
they only represent a very very small fraction  
of the range and therefore are not sufficient to 
prevent high agression from the big plant and the  
last uh type of equity I want to touch on the few 
times is equity over time Equity over time means  
is the equity distribution drastically going to 
change on future cards in this example the time  
is not very long anymore it's just going to be 
the river so only one card but uh it can still  
manifest in ranges in certain ways in strategies 
and uh it can either be driven by the board but  
it can also be driven by hand classes I try to 
explain the whole process of going through the  
Flop and the turn with the life poker example big 
BL checks that the defines the range button checks  
that defines the range much more now we need to 
look at equities and understand what um Equity  
distributions look like and what the effect is in 
strategies and this is especially helpful because  
sometimes the turn doesn't change anything at all 
and those are bricks and I think this is a very  
nice situation to take as a baseline to understand 
basically we are still um having checked through  
the Flop and we haven't seen a turn card yet 
basically and now we understand how ranges  
would play on a brick turn and deviate from there 
if necessary so this what I saved in the AI for  
us to be able to experiment with a few things and 
to uh yeah change settings a little bit so when we  
go to ranges something that is always uh almost 
always the case is that the big blind is going  
to have a very weak range part and that is just 
the case because he has defended the white preb  
and there's always going to be a a lot of hands 
that don't connect with the board at all no matter  
what the board is so he's always going to have a 
lot of very week hands that don't really interact  
with the board at all and just most of the time 
need to give up with a few exceptions that I will  
explain later and then we can have a look at um 
the the top range for example example here I'm  
circling more like the top 25% of hands but it 
doesn't really matter what matters is that we  
can see that the big blind uh consistently has 
more Equity than the button in these scenarios  
when basically the Flop was checked through and 
there was no equity shift on the turn at all one  
thing I also not mentioned is that here uh we can 
see that actually the the button still has the  
absolute nut advantage in the very very top 2% or 
so of the range but as I said that doesn't really  
prevent big plan from showing a lot of aggression 
which we can see in the large sizing that he is  
using so it's more about looking at the top 10 20% 
of range depending on the board exactly to Define  
strategies and this is um basically the typical 
example for no equity shifts at all the turn is  
completely irrelevant what's going to happen is 
the big blend is going to have have the stronger  
top range he still has an undefined range so he's 
all the top pairs all the two pairs all the sets  
he's going to have in a given scenario um and the 
in position player doesn't have them anymore he  
has bet most of his strong hands on the Flop so 
he lost them in the check check line and he's only  
going to have a very tiny fraction of traps that 
he's going to use to defend the turn then another  
thing we can see is here in this specific example 
like in the medium range uh there's nothing to be  
said really and in the the bottom range the as I 
said the button is always going to be ahead like  
his air that he checked is showd downable or it's 
yeah so it's relatively strong while the big plan  
still has a lot of trash and the range Advantage 
for big blind I assume is the question is usually  
always prevalent when there is no equity shift on 
the turn I will also conclude this in the end we  
usually always have a scenar on the turn that 
the big plant has a bottom range disadvantage  
he's still going to have a lot of weak hands that 
haven't improved at all and then um who has the  
nuts depends a lot on the turn and in the moment 
where dealer Burns the card and no turn has been  
dealt it most of the time big blant is going to 
have a top range Advantage even though he might  
be behind in the absolute uh yeah top two to 5% 
or whatever what is very typical for bricks is  
that uh we going to have a very very big bet um 
like the main strategy here is going to be built  
around 2x pot and everything else is relatively 
irrelevant we have a a small frequency of b50  
to B25 but that can be ignored for the most 
part we will see a little bit when it becomes  
really relevant if we want to put it in a very 
simplistic Model H it's not very important part of  
the strategy what is important is the huge overbed 
and that is um something that I also see is one  
of the biggest population leagues that people 
just don't apply big enough pressure in these  
spots they don't use sufficiently big sizings 
to represent their actual Equity distribution  
and one um thing why it is uh is so important to 
use when we look at the turn strategies we always  
want to accomplish something in in the the range 
that we are playing against and when we use really  
big sizings here we're going to see that a lot of 
the overcards have to fold in the imposition range  
and he has to continue most of his mate hands he 
can fold a bunch of lower pairs but he has to kind  
of Pluff catch uh with with his second pair typ 
hands and he is going to fold with his overcards  
and that is very important because applying this 
concept on the turn gives us the option to go very  
thin for value on the river because there's 
very little Equity shifts going to happen now  
so we made sure that Equity over time is pretty 
stable if you imagined you would have bet small  
if the river is a king or something like that or 
a check in positions range would improve much more  
often that is a little bit problematic for our 9x 
because as we saw here our main hand class that  
wants to apply this strategy is going to be top 
hairs so they are relatively V vulnerable because  
a overcard could potentially change equities 
depends a little bit on the river arriving ranges  
but when we bet this big there's very little 
Equity shifts possible just because of the folding  
range from the button on the turn and also we're 
going to produce a relatively low stack to p ratio  
on the river which also allows us to value beted 
a little bit wider but I also want to show you an  
example where I think it's very important to have 
block strategies because we need to differentiate  
undercards enhance or turns that don't change 
Equity distributions at all as I said or  
undercards or turns that connect with the board so 
they don't really change the equity distribution  
of the overcards we remember the button checked 
a lot of high cards king queen ace1 all these  
kind of Holdings and they still didn't change at 
all on the turn when an undercard like the five  
here hits but the big BL is going to gain a very 
big advantage in the upper half of the region so  
now we are talking more about Equity of the range 
you can see here um the big plant is going to have  
50% Equity compared to 47 on the brick again this 
doesn't seem very high just because of the fact  
that the big band carries so much trash in this 
range that is completely irrelevant to the spot  
and it's not going to yeah really influence ranges 
too much it just a plays because it got good  
pre- flop odds and now it hasn't connected it's 
going to give up a lot in any way um now though  
we can see that we have a very relevant and high 
frequency block bed and we can also see another  
thing that our big bed sizing has decreased in 
sizing a little bit and let's explore these two  
mechanics a little bit in GTO whistled as well 
so we are going to look at a five on the turn  
and I mainly want to touch on two different kind 
of Concepts here first of all the downsize of the  
big bed and second of all the emerging block bed 
I mean it was there before but we saw it wasn't  
as relevant as it is today let's trim this down a 
little bit to B25 and b125 just to have a clearer  
cut strategy here but we can also talk a little 
bit about why this pting pattern changes at all  
in a second so now you can see compared to I 
think 15% small bit before we are almost at 30  
so this is become much more important and that 
has a bunch of reasons like first of all we can  
see in the equity distribution what I just showed 
you the the whole big blind range has improved a  
lot especially in the middle so range Equity we 
gained a lot of that and for that reason we want  
to bet more the nut Equity hasn't changed too much 
now the traps from the Flop that in position head  
pocket n or whatever I'm not the absolute nuts 
anymore because we have more 68 64 typee hands  
but that's not really the relevant driver of the 
strategy the relevant driver is the um stronger  
medium hands now our um medium strength hands 
are not only a seven but also a five so there's  
a completely new cluster of hands that has emerged 
that is also incentivized to blockb in order to  
extract value from in positions High cards he's 
still going to have to call Ace highs and King  
highs against our small bat so that is very nice 
to extract some value with our five here and he's  
going to have still a lot of pairs that are five 
or even worse themselves and need to continue so  
we can also extract some value from mads and if 
we take a closer look at the pairs below top pair  
actually one to bet we can see that many of them 
are either going to have a relatively High kicker  
so they can actually extract some value from 
the imposition range from the second pairs or  
under Pockets the buck is does have but many of 
them also have something else going on for them  
they have great Equity over time they have uh the 
option to improve on the river as well they are  
going to have a lot of gunshots going with their 
pair because that is the main difference when we  
look at the the 973 DS versus the 975 not only 
has the 5x as a new hand cluster emerged but also  
a lot of the main hands that were relatively 
indifferent between checking and betting on  
the other example now gained in equity by having 
additional equity on the river by making Straits  
and that incentivizes them a little bit more um 
to go for the thin value on the tur because again  
considering position it is always a little bit 
of a thin tradeoff to go for block sances out  
of position because you are trimming down ranges 
from in position and you are usually so first of  
all that decreases your Equity but then again you 
cannot really prevent the button from realizing a  
lot of equity right he's still going to call a lot 
of his M hands so he's still going to hit a lot  
of um rivers on all different kinds of run outs 
therefore Equity denial is very hard to accomplish  
here and being out of position it is not a great 
strategy to build a pot that you are not going to  
win very very often so for that reason on these 
kind of turns where there's additional Equity  
emerging for the maintenance for the smaller pairs 
it's very very good uh to implement this strategy  
compared to the brick turn another thing that is 
also important to understand when you implement a  
small bed strategy you're always going to have 
to sacrifice a few of your very strong hands  
in order to be able to defend against this 
aggression on the turn when he raises you of  
course Very questionable how realistic this is 
in real games but we are talking about GTO poker  
about Balan strategies and here in these scenarios 
you have to sacrifice some of the hands that are  
stronger than second pair uh to be integrated in 
a small bed range so you can actually um continue  
against races sufficiently and still be uncapped 
there and that is for example not a tradeoff that  
is worth it on 973 do to sacrifice some strong 
hands that have a huge gain in protection by  
betting 2x Point against the overcards to be able 
to bet more of relatively IND different hands like  
a seven with a small size but here first of all 
we have wider variety of hands available we have  
Straits more two pairs that weren't existing on 
the brick turn there we just had top pairs or  
worse H so we have more hands to choose from 
that we could potentially sacrifice as a blockb  
and then again we also just have stronger hands 
absolutely speaking we have straights sow but if  
this River turn is so good for for the big plan 
why do we downsize then with our big sizing is a  
questions we could ask ourself and the reason for 
that is equity over time to some degree when we  
bet b125 here in position has to defend um most 
of his M hands most of his pairs H I think for  
humans it's very hard to grasp the difference in 
continuing ranges for B 125 to B1 200 or something  
like that it just for us feels like an overb and 
we have to fold a lot um but if we would bet to  
export here um there would be Rivers where um out 
of position would just plummet so much inqu equity  
because if we would do that or let's actually add 
it if we would bet really really large here Buton  
would fold a lot of his main but would continue 
some of his draws and then on some Rivers for  
example a six where the remaining relatively weak 
M hands still improve or a club for example big  
plan range would become so weak or would have so 
little options to extract additional value because  
now in position has folded most of his relatively 
weak M hands on the turn already and now he's  
improving a lot and that is just the spotted 
solvers try to avoid of course it's only going  
to be a few specific Rivers but when you consider 
the whole game Tre becomes relevant so when Equity  
over time becomes a little bit worse BS become a 
little bit more Dynamic then uh usually uh the the  
top sizing decreases a bit we we just bet a little 
bit smaller in order to keep the continuing range  
of the other player wide enough so we don't create 
very bad River spots for ourselves and this is not  
a black and white thing it's a sliding scale you 
could um continue this trend you could make the B  
9736 and the B the top sizing would probably be B 
100 and you could make it 9738 and the top sizing  
would be become b75 so it's more like a trend 
that emerges through the board structures than  
an absolute set in stone strategy you're going 
to see but it's very helpful to understand the  
logic behind it so that's undercards and the other 
side of the coin is overcards of course and while  
for example A brick is a card that doesn't 
change Equity at all usually an over card  
is going to be an equity shift to some degree in 
in position's favor right um he checked a lot of  
Ace king king queen type hands on the Flop and now 
he's improving to top pairs on the turn with some  
of his m a air hands and so his condense range is 
improving in a little bit of a part and also hands  
like Queen check are picking up more Equity Queen 
10 are picking up Equity so you can see that the  
button regains his top range Advantage so that's 
important to understand when we think think about  
range composition to think about it before we 
actually think about the turn cut and consider  
that one as well because this can change things a 
little bit again as we see here so now what we can  
see um when we lose our top range advantage that 
we had on the undercards we are also going to lose  
our big sizing no nut Equity Advantage no big bets 
very classic get the sample um but we're still  
going to have a block bed and we will talk about 
why in a second this can of course have differing  
decrease of magnitude you can have cards that 
are first of all connected to the flop in terms  
of the overcard like the 97 uh n 10 973 connects 
more um with the 8X the 10 n 97s and so on and  
then the King which is very disconnected but it 
also differs in height and very simply speaking  
the higher the card the better it is going to be 
for the inos player and Ace is better than a king  
is better than a queen is better than a check and 
so on and so forth and what we will see following  
this trend is the higher the card the lower the 
betting frequency is going to be for the big  
blade because the card is going to be worse for 
him and then the second thing like for example  
having sizings bigger than the block is more about 
the connectedness of the board but what you will  
usually never see is a bets here on these kind 
of boards I will show you another example later  
as well because it is a slight Equity shift in in 
position's favor here for example you can see that  
uh he clearly gains the top range Advantage again 
now he's ahead again in terms of strong hands here  
it's more like even but we are out of position and 
that is reason enough for us not to start building  
a pot to liberally and rather relay different 
strategies for reasons that we are going to talk  
about now so let's use the king as an example that 
illustrates a bunch of things like first of all of  
course we are still going to have strong hands 
just as the button but we are going to be out  
of position what is important here is this range 
part where um the button is going to have a lot of  
yeah stronger pairs than we do in the tto world 
Mao has already addressed it there is very much  
aggression especially on Equity shifts against 
block bed so when we Block B the in position  
player is going to raise 25% of the time and that 
is very questionable if that happens in reality  
so when we decide to implement a blockb strategy 
only that is not only a function of our ranges  
but also relying on the f fact that our opponent 
is helping us build a pot he's going to raise for  
us to some degree so that is one function that 
is going on here that is very questionable if  
that happens in reality today I want to stay 
focused on GTO Logics for the most part just  
because there's quite a lot to cover in just this 
one chapter but I can tell you that when you would  
not log for example the in position B not to be 
aggressive enough against a small bit or a check  
then you would actually have to start building a 
part yourself besides this fact like we still have  
decent range Equity right because there was check 
check on on the Flop and we still have a decent  
nut Equity here we still elect to bet small 
because we get raised sufficiently but when  
we actually look at which hands are interested 
more in a bet than a checked and this might be  
surprising right quickly um jumping back to the 
strategy we saw that the actual betting strategy  
was just a wild mix of M hands for the most part 
in contrast to the big bets where we saw that a  
lot of the Bluffs are going to be draws air hands 
basically with relatively strong equity in Block  
bed strategies most of the Bluffs are rather 
condensed so they are either like high cards  
or draws to some degree but usually like they not 
really any absolute trash hands in there and then  
we just go a little bit wider with M hands and 
sometimes we add in a few high card hands that  
achieve for example cheaper Equity realization 
with their draws or they can fold out a little  
bit of equity and not face a very unfavorable 
scenario off goinging check bet and we face yeah a  
bed that we can't call so those hands go in there 
as well but for the most part it's just a very  
sizing logic that is built around M hands a lot 
in any way when we look at this range we can see  
it's a wide mix of all different kind of pairs 
and when we compare the EVs and look for the red  
colors in here red meaning these hands are more 
interested in betting than checking you can see  
that it's actually not really the top pairs 
that are the ones that drive the strategy but  
rather the second pair type P and some specific 
suits or third pairs these kind of things and  
that is something that is also a very useful and 
important Concept in GTO poker and general and  
one that might differ a little bit from reality 
so when we check in position is going to use a  
huge overb right he has gained not advantages 
again so sizing is big he's going to bet very  
big again and when he does that what we are going 
to have is is an indifferent hand with our 9x with  
our 7x here you can see it very slightly the nine 
is starting to fold the seven is clearly starting  
to fold so we can also look at EV and we can see 
that all these hands have kind of lost their EV  
choosing this line and then a way out of this was 
to block in the first place and you can see the  
clearer blocks here and the ones that create the 
EV difference at once that have a clear preference  
are actually going to be certain pair hands that 
are indifferent zero EV against a polarized bed  
from inos because when we check inos is going to 
either bets stronger hands than ours and Bluffs  
so we need to call sometimes but we don't have EB 
anymore because it polarizes around our hand glass  
but when we instead choose to block we will get 
value from a vast majority of weaker M hands and  
even some um air hands like showd downable air 
hands a high and similar so blocking in these  
spots is often the more attractive option for this 
kind of re at the in position overb other double  
check rhous for the most part it's just relatively 
dry Equity shifts on the turn four in position so  
usually High cards and you can also see pretty fun 
Logics around here when you look at which height  
the high count is the better it is the bigger 
the BET becomes for example um you would over  
bet smaller on a check or whatever uh that's also 
something you can use as a guideline but I would  
try to simplify my strategies in practice in 
a way where you can um yeah actually execute  
it uh to some degree but anyway this is a reason 
also why we can only Block B because in position  
again is building the PO for us in some way too 
either by over betting delayed or raising or BL  
we have covered the most important mechanics 
already and now a few special cases there are  
some two Broadway boards which are not like 
really interested in blocking actually no two  
two Broadway boards are interested in blocking but 
just in over betting for a bunch of reasons and  
the thing I wanted to say is these two Broadway 
boards can either emerge on the turn or have been  
there on the Flop so it could be a b like Queen 
76 check like the one I show here but it could  
also be a board like King queen8 flush dra in a 
brick turn if the in position player chooses to  
play an according CIT strategy in any case the the 
driving Factor here is that there is no advantage  
in the medium strength hands for the big blind and 
the reason for that is very simple when you elect  
block bet strategies your goal is kind of for 
foring wider continues by the inos player um but  
it is always combined with a tradeoff and when we 
think back to the example with the 9735 we noticed  
that a lot of the hands that were interested in 
Block betting had additional Equity going for  
them and that was the main driver why they were 
blocking in the first place but in the example  
of the two Broadway boards the logic is reversed 
when we now block we are actually not really going  
to deny a it but we are going to allow in position 
to realize Equity with a lot of their bottom range  
with the remainder air that is usually going to 
be gutshot tire panss and a lot of them are off  
suit uh so very high frequency and they can very 
happily realize the equity they can even show  
aggression against us because some of his hands 
also improve on the turn but more importantly  
what going to happen now he's going to re I this 
Equity we are going to be out of position playing  
on the river the the equity over time is going 
to be more important and we are going to play a  
bigger part in a spot where inquisitions range 
is going to improve often on the river and uh  
that is just not a scenario we want um you also 
need to consider that like a check is not really  
a carted has been claimed yet so if we wanted to 
implement a block sizing from the logic before  
it would be built around a seven a lot and those 
hands especially are going to suffer against the  
double overcard plus added Equity type hands from 
a player that's in position and he's going to hit  
the check on top of it sometimes with his King 
check ACE check tire pants pocket checks and so  
on and so forth so what's going to happen is the 
big blind is never going to have clear advantage  
in the medium strength of hands so betting with 
a medium strong hand is also not attractive Bing  
ranges are exclusively built around the top range 
around nut Equity only around big sizings and  
medium or small sizes are not attractive at all 
and as I said it doesn't really matter how this  
spot came to exist it could have been from the 
Flop or from the turn so then there's one more  
logic I wanted to show you most dynamic flops 
kind of are like the connected underc car turns  
when you look at the board like Queen 867 or 765 
King there are some similar similarities going  
on first of all we have a lot of different hand 
glasses available to our range that we're already  
there on the Flop we don't only have like the top 
pairs from 973 du but we had Straits already on  
the Flop we had a lot of two pairs on the Flop 
so that allows wider um strategic diversity that  
we can use we have different handes we can do 
different things and a lot of the stuff we have  
seen already is going to come into play here 
we're going to have a lot of main hands with  
additional Equity we have a lot of nuts we can 
induce races when we block bed but we also have  
super super strong hands that want to build a PO 
right away especially with certain blockers that  
are unfavorable for the imposition player so when 
we block certain hands he's not going to raise so  
often and for that reason we need to build a pot 
ourself so we we still going to have a big sizing  
in contrast to the other overcards or to the other 
connected turns but again it's going to be smaller  
because the equity overtime is not so stable we 
want to force imposition to continue relatively  
wide so on a nine River for example uh not all of 
his remaining 8X improve and we are going to uh  
yeah have very big drop in with our rate and then 
we can also see that we have a lot of hands that  
rather lock bet ourselves get value from hands 
that would elect to check back against our check  
instead and um force in position to build a PO 
for us as well so that way we are applying a  
few Logics we've seen already at the same time 
and leveraging some EV by blocking instead of  
check hauling against the polarized range very 
big contrast to that is a board with extremely  
stable Equity not equity for the big plan so here 
we had the drips on the Flop and we are basically  
not interested in doing a lot uh different than 
just leveraging that we can also include some top  
pairs in our over betting range but again there's 
no real medium strength H for the big plan that  
want to implement an additional strategy so for 
that reason here um again the B is very dry the  
nut Equity is in big plan's favor so big sizing is 
super important what we see though is we sizing a  
bit smaller than on 973 du we don't just to export 
all the time but also downsize a little bit and  
the reason for that is mainly that you have your 
your Equity is not going to change at all anymore  
on 9 C3 du we had an incentive to fold out the 
overcards to create a river spot where we have a  
low spr an in position is not going to hit certain 
cards anymore and here it doesn't really matter a  
six is just a nuts on the river and what are you 
going to do here even though it's not very visible  
you are approaching a geometric bed size which is 
b130 because that one will forced in position to  
go brog over turn River most frequently and that's 
what you're trying to achieve here on also not  
equity for big blind dry Bo so very comparable in 
a way to 97 3 do but then again very different in  
terms of the hand class that is going to produce 
the beted for the most part but again also what I  
forgot to mention was we overall have less Equity 
because in position checks more hands like pocket  
Queens checks TS a few King eggs on the Flop so 
yeah that's also a difference to 973 do and the  
rest I already said there was no equity shifts 
at all Equity the not Equity is still for the  
big blind so big bets only and here especially 
it's important to not forget about your future  
PLS it's very easy to just bet flush draws 75 109 
type hands and then when these hands improve on  
the river you don't have Bluffs left and good 
regulars will exploit You by not paying you  
off on the river anymore so that leads us to 
the summary the starting point on the turn is  
basically before the turn card is being DT in that 
moment the big blant has a top range advantage  
the whole ranges are usually about equal um 
it depends a little bit how the Manifest the  
turn overcast Equity shift to Big BL to button 
um no overcard it remains stable sometimes the  
big plan gains a little bit of EV especially on 
draw completers and the bottom range is always  
worse for the big plan he still has a lot of trash 
on any given board when the top range Advantage  
remains for the big blant we always need to have 
a big sizing and when we see the equity over time  
is less stable like on the more connected boils 
we generally need to downsize that big sizing if  
there's an equity shift for in position like the 
973 DWIs King then we need to either check a lot  
or bet small if you would look at 973 a for 
example you would probably range check almost  
and then when you look at big bet strategies most 
often your your betting selection especially on  
try uh turns is going to be around pair type hands 
and your Bluffs are very natural for the most part  
High Equity hands like gutshots open Enders flush 
draws but don't forget your future Bluffs when  
these draws improve you still need air in theory 
at least and a small sizings are always a little  
bit more merged rather expanded in the M hand 
category more pairs weer pairs maybe even some  
showd downable high cards but not really a lot 
of unnatural glovs as well now we have briefly  
covered what you can look out when you study these 
spots for yourself in G wizard but um of course we  
need to consider some real world limitations and 
I think the two that are most important I already  
addressed first of all aggression versus leads 
population just doesn't raise enough so maybe  
you can play a little bit around with the nod log 
feature see what happens if people don't raise you  
enough if that changes your sizing choice for 
example in the first place especially of block  
bets and um if people bet big enough do they over 
bet on try overcard turns if they don't what does  
it do to your strategy with the AI feature you 
have great options to explore it and then I also  
want to I want to um suggest a few things to 
expand on especially the the varying decrees  
of equity shifts in terms of like how does a card 
connect with the Flop um there's often be going  
to be differences in size choice and hand Choice 
when you look at bars like 973 du versus 9735 or  
six or eight turn or three flush we have covered 
all the Logics you're going to need to understand  
the spots but the actual strategy differs a 
lot so that's definitely something you want  
to expl explore yourselves and also the varial 
um overcards because they lead to a little bit  
cleaner or less clean cut strategies in terms of 
blocking and checking and sometimes implementing  
something like b50 or b75 Bo pairing turns very 
similar I think also we have covered most of the  
Logics that apply there but they are a little 
bit different because it always depends on the  
nut Equity exclusivity like not only who has these 
nuts but does somebody has them exclusively and  
the other guy doesn't have them at all or how is 
the balance will usually manifest in a bigger or  
smaller big sizing and then really the only way to 
get better at these things is first understanding  
the concepts and then drilling Drilling 
and drilling again um is my recommendation  
especially right after these presentations when 
your knowledge is still fresh sit down um take  
the time to go over this uh it's very interesting 
in poker to always acquire new knowledge but your  
game only gets really better if you also practice 
what you've learned and um integrate it in your  
Bame in your autopilot a little bit more if you 
have any questions um leave them in Discord leave  
a comment we will try to get back to you for sure 
um feedback on this session is welcome as well and  
I am trying to adjust my future seminars on what 
you guys need what you guys find most helpful as  
I said was my first one today I'm very excited 
to be part of the GD wiard team and I hope that  
I will provide lots of value to you guys in the 
future but it helps me a lot if you guys let me  
know what kind of content you appreciate 
it as well anyway thank you for watching  
and being part of this live seminar and I wish 
all of you guys good luck at the tables [Music]
