### TOPIC: exploiting fish
[Music] no matter how good you are and how much 
you study with solvers your Edge against the  
regulars at your limit will probably never 
exceed 8 big BLS per 100 but when playing  
against fish with a lose rate of minus 40 bb 
or higher mastering your game against them  
could give you a double digit Edge all while 
spending significantly less time studying this  
is jaser 1337 for GTO Wizard and today we'll 
reveal the magic behind exploiting recreational
[Music] players we will start with an introduction 
then explore to lose aggressive fish profiles  
including the toughest one of all and discuss 
preflop and P flop exploits against them we'll  
also briefly go through some other common fish 
profiles and outline the basic adjustments against  
them in the end I will demonstrate cre some 
Universal Tendencies and the decision making  
process that can be applied to any profile the 
materials used in this video are the results of  
many years of my experience in online high stage 
games plus the massive data analysis based on 20  
million hands played by recreational players from 
nl100 to n l5k the data helped identify the seven  
main fish profiles analyze their weaknesses and 
learn how to build maximum exploits against each  
of them knowing the typical adjustments and 
exploits Based on data could give us a huge  
Edge but it wouldn't be possible without precise 
fish profiling in the first place let's look at  
the following profiles pause this video for 
a moment and think how you would play against  
these two recreational players would you notice 
any difference while multi-tabling and having  
two opponents like this now let's reveal more 
information about them on the left you can see  
the aggressive station type or the pirania on the 
right the aggressive folding type or the mor eill  
even though these two players have very similar 
batting and raising Tendencies their play as a  
collar is quite different the panas bite into the 
pot and don't let go easily there are almost no  
spots in the game where they overfall and can be 
pushed off the pot easily compare them to Mor ills  
who are more cautious without the initiative 
and fold much more especially on the river  
to correctly identify whether the lose aggressive 
fish at our table is a station or a folding one we  
must one the number one priority is to watch the 
showdowns to notice how widely they call two pay  
attention to timing tells here is one example 
if they tank the full time bank and fault we  
learn nothing but if they make a quick call with a 
marginal Bluff catcher we can mark them as likely  
aggressive stations three we should not rely on 
stats too much unless as we''ve played thousands  
of hands with them consider these hands played by 
typical mors who folded and showed their hand and  
ask yourself whether you would expect such faults 
from somebody as lose and aggressive firsthand we  
have pocket n calling three betat checkal flop 
checkal turn and then fold against a river Shelf  
with a fourth set then we have king queen off flop 
in two pairs c b flop double barel in turn B in  
on a river and folding against a check race and 
showing our hand lastly we have a squeen off  
calling three B under the gun in position Colin 
flop coling turn and then with a top Air and top  
kicker against Three quars River bad we just fold 
even one Showdown like this is enough to confirm  
that our opponent is a folding one this aggressive 
Fen fish are the toughest profile to play against  
let's consider our brief Strat against lose 
aggressive types when we have no initiative  
how white should we call three bet or four bet 
against their raises when building our preflop  
range against any opponent a few factors defined 
our strategy size frequency and composition of the  
open Rays effective stack size whether we get paid 
off when we hit something relative positions are  
we in position or out of position are there other 
players behind and Equity realization defined by  
our POS flop skill against regulars we have the 
calculated GTO ranges that take all these factors  
into account but what about playing against fish 
there is no calculated static GTO here because  
their preflop ranges depend on their profile 
and current tilt level our pass flop Edge is  
much higher meaning that the equity realization 
of our hands will increase and allow us to play  
even wider ranges to what extent well it depends 
on how confident we are playing with wider ranges  
the quality of our reads our understanding of fish 
profiles and the knowledge of how to exploit them  
here are the opening ranges of lose aggressive 
fish they tend to play very Loosely from early  
positions opening 32% under the gun at a six Max 
table while defending very wide against reats with  
the help of G wizard we will build effective 
pre-lap strategies in a few simple steps in  
G wizard we go to change custom Solutions new 
solution and go to pre flop use the settings make  
sure to add 0.25 anti inbb per player so we get 
the right pod dos and remember that small blind is  
player in position and big blind is player out of 
position then we click on create the solution and  
go to a not loocking option here we must select 
32% opening range we can do that by entering 32%  
here and then entering folding range again to get 
rid of these small errors now one more thing to  
correct is the range itself because according 
to data fish prefers to open suited connectors  
and off suited Aces so let's edit this range a 
little bit okay now it looks more realistic we  
go to lock all and click not loock the big blind 
reaction is to three bat using a big polar size  
however we must remember that our opponent is 
going to call much wider than GTO so we must  
take it into account we go to nolock as we know 
average lose aggressive fish calls around 66% in  
this position however because we will use a 
bigger size three betting them we can lower  
their defense frequency to around 50 maybe 4 55% 
so let's select a realistic wrench first once we  
have entered the their colon range against three 
bets and four betting range we go to lock all  
and not lock option again we go back to big blind 
strategy as you can see our strategy has changed  
now with three bet more deepar strategy however 
it is still not perfect and there are things to  
be adjusted keep in mind that we play against fish 
and we don't need to balance we don't need to be  
unexploitable we want to pretty much Max exploit 
them therefore we can three bat all of our hands  
that seem like a pure value three bats and then 
never three bat the bottom of our range that is  
here only because the strategy was built against 
the solver who would exploit us if we're not  
balanced and if we deviate from the GTO because 
we play against the fish our Equity realization  
is going to be so much better we can call even 
wider if we have some additional reads and can  
outplay our opponent post flop even more and vice 
versa if we play against somebody very aggressive  
who barrels a lot then the bottom of our range is 
not going to play that good and we can just fold  
those in different hands our final three betting 
strategy out of position is very depolarized and  
consist of our best hands as for inos three bets 
the logic is quite different here we want to three  
bat using a smaller size with as wide range as 
we can because our goal is to play as many pots  
against fish for a cheap price as possible in the 
most common lines when our villain open raises  
pre flap in position and then seats on the Flop 
turn or river there are no obvious weaknesses to  
be attacked except for the lowest sizes being 
slightly weaker but even there we don't really  
enjoy any overfalls unless we go for a check 
race plus multi Street Bluff they don't overfall  
against check race or check race plus Barling on 
any Street either defending about right so how do  
we exploit them the fun stuff happens when they 
check on the Flop as an aggressor especially in  
the single race SPS they seem to severely underrot 
their check in behind range and then overfall on  
the later streets against the specific sets of 
sizes the lower the board the weaker there check  
behind range and the more we can attack it taken 
into account the turn run out of course on the  
left table in the frequency percentage field you 
can see they are folding frequency by different  
board types we can enjoy enough fold Equity pretty 
much on any River except for Ace High boards  
or when the ace comes on the turn or the river 
because their checking behind range has too many  
Ace highs on the right table is there play after 
the flop in position check back the fold Equity  
highly depends on our turn probe and reer bat size 
for example in the first row you can see check and  
then fault against 33% bet the fault is 25% only 
which is very low which means that we shouldn't  
ever Bluff one street only with a block bit size 
if we bet 75% on the turn they tend to fall 46  
which is about right and against spb or higher 
they seem to fall 64 which seems like a slightly  
overfall here we can consider a different set 
of turns plus reer bed sizes and the fold Equity  
they create keeping this in mind we want to split 
our Bluffs into a few different sizes to maximize  
our fold Equity as a one street Bluff the only 
size that enjoys a decent 64% over fold is the  
podb Plus for this reason we can Blu B once with 
around 10% size with weak Bluffs like one or two  
overcards overb 100 50 to 200% with not flash 
draws and monster draws to maximize F liity now  
and give up on most rivers because of bad blockers 
bad three quarters turn with gut shots open Enders  
and non not flash Jaws to inflate the pot on the 
turn while having decent draw Equity then take it  
down on the river by over batting around 125% B 
1/3 on the turn with the weakest hands like two  
other cards for example example 109 at King 8 do3 
board with the plan to overbed Bluff on blanks or  
battery quar on flush closing Rivers if we have 
a blocker let's consider a couple of other lines  
where we can gain extra EV both bat check bat and 
check check bat lines seem to be severely over  
bluffed with a clear tendency the lower the size 
the weaker it is besides Bluff catching Rivers as  
why wi as possible our adjustment should be to 
check call more often instead of block batting  
once we get checked on the turn when we are out of 
position on the river for example we call in the  
big blind against the mor e on the button single 
Ray part board is Queen 75 The Flash draw we check  
call on the flap the turn goes check check and 
on the river we are faced with a decision should  
we bet or check and what size should we use with 
different hands we have the range advantage and  
want to attack a big part of our opponent's range 
that consist of the worst hands like weak Pairs  
and Ace highs the solers suggest using a block bat 
as the main size to Value bet second Pairs and the  
best under Pairs and then to quots or higher for 
our top pairs or better but what if we nlock the  
rer strategy according to the data that tells 
us about the massive over Bluffs by the lose  
aggressive fish let's go back to strategy select 
nolock go to set strategy and here to see what  
happens let's increase the rear Bluff frequency 
with the nomade hands Ace highs and King highs to  
40% and leave the weak pairs as they are on sum 
notes these weak pairs can be considered thin  
value BS while in others they are clear Bluffs now 
we select lock all and nlock now the Block B size  
that was used for our medium hands is gone and all 
those hands become become much more profitable in  
check colon against the over Bluffs compare DV 
of hands like A7 or King 7 the check EV is 7.61  
while block betting is only 7.19 that's a big EV 
loss we should only start adding block BS to our  
arsenal when our villain is very aggressive pass 
slop and can be provoked into raising by these  
smaller bats same logic can be applied when 
the action goes check check up to the river  
we can see massive over Bluffs that increase 
as the bat size decreases the only under Bluff  
check check bat happens after the four straight 
turns seems like they intuitively prefer to under  
Bluff here another interesting find is there play 
in three pots as callar out of position on the  
Flop on the Flop there is no fold Equity against 
the 33% seabat plus we risk getting check raised  
almost twice more often compared to when we bet 
75% a BLB is definitely not something we want to  
do with our Bluffs especially the wner ones like 
two back door flush draw Equity type of hands here  
we can follow the same logic that we applied in 
our turn prop strategy to exploit their reaction  
against different sets of sizes pause this video 
for a moment and let me know in the comments how  
would you build your max exploit strategy as a 
three batter in position given this info to finish  
with the lose aggressive types here is another 
interesting Discovery even though the VPAP pfr  
and agression frequency thresholds used in the 
expression stats were the same for both profiles  
there seems to be a correlation between their 
calling and bluffing Tendencies the higher the  
bluffing frequency of a lose aggressive player the 
more they seem to Bluff cage themselves the panas  
tend to over Bluff noticeably more almost in every 
line compared to the mor eels keep this notion  
in mind when Bluff catching against them imagine 
that we used only basic criteria like vpip and pfr  
for profile creation we would have missed these 
important aspects and the value that comes with  
it to get as precise profiles as possible every 
profile was designed with a set of hand toote  
expression stats that also include aggression 
frequency calling and folding Tendencies and  
loss rates since you've already met the lose 
aggressive inhabitants let me introduce other  
fish profiles without going too much into detail 
meet the passive colon station or the puffer fish  
they don't raise much pre flop have low P flop 
aggression frequencies and call down too much  
given how wide their pre flop ranges are and their 
last C rageous passive folding friend The Flounder  
who also plays a wide range pre flop but then 
overfalls on the turn and the re and doesn't like  
to Bluff catch at all the flounder has a distant 
relative a very boring to play against tight and  
passive semi fish or the tadp TPS play similarly 
but make fewer mistakes we can treat them the same  
way we treat loose passive fish while keeping in 
mind that these guys are a bit tighter and make  
fewer mistakes if a TP is the only recreational 
player at your table you might consider changing  
it because their loss rate might not cover the 
Riku pay especially in a high rake environment  
on the top of our menu there are two rare and very 
important fish one is a passive VIP or the whale  
these players have a vpip of 60% or higher and 
a preflop race percentage Under 12 they exhibit  
relatively low POS flop aggression and a very high 
R to Showdown percentage when they have at least  
something they tend to pay very generously the 
other VIP is his adventurous and very aggressive  
body the clownish with a pre flap raise of 20% 
or higher these players are much more aggressive  
pre flop they also apply a lot of pressure pass 
flop fighting for pots calling down where lightly  
spewing chips left and right an average loss 
rate of minus 86 evbb per 100 makes them the  
most welcom guest at the table basic adjustments 
against the passive stations on the flop in  
position out of position do not automatically 
check medium hands don't be afraid to block that  
in position with a weak range on any Street there 
is always at least some fold Equity check behind  
weak draws more often on the turn in position 
given there is not enough equity on the river  
and don't Bluff enough versus m seabat play Max 
exploit with multiple sizes on every street do not  
balance versus the passive folding fish isolate 
with a very wide range and a slightly bigger  
size actively Bluff barrel increase your sizing 
with Bluffs for extra fold Equity versus lose  
aggressive provoke with a value hand try to make 
his bed the last one let him do the bluffing with  
a strong draw in a mediumsized pot try to make 
your B last for example in three bat or forb Pots  
if you have a strong Equity hands consider shoving 
yourself so you don't get res shoved with a weaker  
hand Bluff catch much wider against most lines the 
more often they bet against our checks the more we  
want to check raise instead of betting ourselves 
or the more they Pro bet the more we want to check  
back our weak hands in position and then Bluff 
catch turns and rivers lastly I've built this  
custom stats to find the correlation between the 
set of sizes and the strength of the range even  
though each profile has its own Tendencies most 
of them do share some common patterns here we  
will only consider the inos play in single race 
SPS by the fish highlighted in Orange you can  
see the bad sizing Tendencies on the turn for all 
profiles together for instance at the top it shows  
the range composition on the turn if the flap 
C but size was between 33 and 50% and then the  
turn se but size increased this part is not very 
useful for studying Universal Tendencies because  
turn range composition varies significantly 
between different profiles the puffer fish  
would not Bluff nearly as much as the pirania or 
the clown fish the rearer part highlighted in red  
is more useful because regardless of the profile 
recreational players tend to think similarly while  
reading different boards following similar human 
biases consider the first example at the top with  
the increasing seet size on each Street when the 
turn and River are both blanks it's a universal  
spot for under bluffing with only 26% of weak 
hands in the thir Barrel when its size is r  
L lower than three quarters an even better example 
if the bat size increases on every street and the  
River card completes the flush expect a big 
under Bluff from any recreational player you  
face interestingly if the flush was completed 
on the turn and they Barrel the reiver with an  
increased size they seem to overbluff likely due 
to having too many intuitive Bluffs with a suited  
card on the turn and then not giving up enough on 
the river in contrast if the turn was a blank on  
a flash dra board they lack enough Bluffs being 
to flash draw heavy in their turn Barrel remember  
while we can divide the most common types of fish 
into the profiles and identify the shared patterns  
each profile has its flaws and misses out some 
individual nuances each recreational player is  
an individual with his own whims that should be 
identified and exploited if you want to maximize  
your Edge your decision- making process should 
go as follows first rely on individual reads  
the second most important thing is logic if 
your opponent represents Nothing by taking a  
weird line chances are they have nothing but not 
always refer back to the individual reads then  
consider profile reads studying each Prof profile 
meticulously and identifying them correctly can  
give you a massive Edge against any recreational 
player timing tells can help with your decision  
a lot but their accuracy is not perfect stats are 
the least important because we rarely have played  
enough hands against a given fish and trusting 
low sample data could be very misleading if  
unsure it's better to ignore the data than 
fall prey to a fallacy I hope You' enjoyed
