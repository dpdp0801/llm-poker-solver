### TOPIC: what is pot geometry in poker
let's talk about one of the most
influential theories when it comes to
bed sizing in poker I'm speaking of
course about the geometric bet size in
this video we're going to talk about the
concept of pot geometry we'll talk a
little bit about Clairvoyance why this
matters we'll put Theory into practice
and then we're going to say why this
doesn't always happen in GTO without
further Ado let's talk about pot
geometry
so the geometric bet size is a really
fascinating theoretical Concept in poker
in this video we're going to discuss
what is pot geometry we're going to talk
a little bit about Clairvoyance and
polarization
we're going to talk about why this
matters following that we're going to
put some Theory into practice so you can
learn how to actually implement this in
your game
and lastly we're going to look at
non-geometric strategies
so what is pot geometry well in poker
this refers to betting an equal fraction
of the pot on each Strait such that
you're all in by the river for example
sixty percent pot sixty percent pot
sixty percent pot Chef now why does this
matter why is it that you would want to
bet an equal fraction on each Street
well like I said this concept is
fundamental to bed sizing Theory a
geometric betting strategy maximizes
your opponent's overall defending range
this theoretically forces them to put in
the most money into the pot therefore
when we have a perfectly polarized range
in other words we have the nuts are
nothing we want to use a strategy that
maximizes how much money they put into
the pot the best strategy is then to bet
the same pot percentage on every street
such that we're all in by the river so
before we go on let's just go over some
Basics what is perfectly polarized well
perfectly polarized means we either have
the nuts or a bluff and villains range
is Bluff catchers relative to our range
so they always beat a bluff and they
always lose to our value now given that
we're perfectly polarized
we are clairvoyant
now Clairvoyant is a fancy word outside
of Poker you might think of it as
psychic having outside knowledge that
you shouldn't have but in poker or in
Game Theory it refers to a situation
where you know whether or not you're
ahead or behind you know if you have the
winning hand or the losing hand
conversely villain who has a bluff
catcher does not know if they are ahead
or behind and that information
dissimetry is fundamental to why you'd
want to use this strategy so enough talk
let's actually show you this concept in
practice now like we said the core idea
is that it will maximize how much money
villain puts into the pot let's go take
a look at the spreadsheet so we can see
that in action
so here is a cool tool that I've made to
help you visualize and better understand
this concept so here we can see
we can enter the pot stack number of
bets and it's going to calculate a
geometric sizing so for example let's
say it's a button versus big blind
single race pot the pot is five and a
half stacks are 97.5 and we want to get
in over three streets
well if we bet
115.8 percent of the pot on flop turn
and River
we're gonna get Stacks in smoothly such
that we're all in by the river villains
final calling range is about 10 of their
original starting range
how do I know that well it's an
estimation based on the minimum defense
frequency
on each Street
so 46 times 46 times 46 percent equals
about 10 percent
now there's two interesting things you
can do here for one you can play around
with this to try and see
for example how wide their final calling
range is based on different sprs so
imagine a button open versus small blind
three bets let's say they three bet to
11 big blinds so the pot will be
22 plus 1 23 and the stacks are 89. well
now we see that they need to defend just
over a quarter of their range as the spr
decreases their stack-off range
increases
so for a single raised pot
here we can see if we bet an equal
fraction on three streets
they're going to defend about 11 of
their range whereas
if we just open ship they only defend
about six percent of their range
according to minimum defense frequency
whereas for a three bed pot where the
spr is maybe closer to three four
they have to defend significantly more
of their range
and we can estimate that their final
stack off range is somewhere between
this blue line and this uh green line is
it green or yellow I'm colorblind anyway
the idea is
the shallower the stacks the less money
behind the more they have to call and
that has a direct effect on your
strategy right because they're going to
have to defend more When there's less
money behind and that dulls the value of
the nut Advantage whereas in like a 200
Big line Depot
the nut Advantage counts for so much
more because by the time you get all the
money in you're only looking at like a
tiny fraction of their original starting
range anyway back to the geometric
sizing we can take a look at this tab
here
now what I've done is I've just entered
a bunch of arbitrary betting strategies
that happen to get it all in
by the river so you can go like 10 20
percent and then you know 900 percent
or you can use maybe something a little
more reasonable like 120 170 60.
something like this
and what I've done is I've graphed
or I've calculated how much money they
tend to put in so this here is just
their final calling range based on MDF
times the pot
and then on the right here we have
villains total contribution that is to
say The Times They fold the Flop or call
flop and then full turn
or call flop and turn and then fold
River or call all three and see a
showdown
and then subtract the original starting
pot so
this is how much money villain
contributes to the pot based on our
betting strategy
and what you'll find is that ridiculous
jagged
strategies such as you know check check
1600 ship
are going to cause them to defend
as tight as possible and therefore put
in the least amount of money into the
pot
conversely
smooth betting strategies such as 110
110 110
caused them to put in more money into
the pot
and if you're a theory nerd like me you
can do some math and calculate the
standard deviation that is to say how
similar are these numbers and the more
similar these numbers are flop bet turn
bet and riverbed the smoother the
betting strategy is so we can say that
smooth betting strategies
tend to do better or tend to cause
villain to put in more money than rough
betting strategies
and of course I had to graph this
because graphs are fun
and so here we see the amount of money
villain puts into the pots based on how
smooth it is and as it gets smoother and
smoother the more money they put in
lastly I wanted a way to visualize all
three bets and the total money going
into the pot
so it's difficult to do this well
because it's hard to visualize four
dimensions on a two-dimensional screen
but here's what I came up with
so this top line here is the total
amount of money they put into the pot
and these
here are the sizes of the bets so for
example
you get this massive River bet
and like smaller flop and turn bats when
you use these Jagged rough strategies
there's less money going into the pot
but as the strategies get smoother and
smoother
that is to say
you're betting a similar portion on each
streets to get Stacks in by the river
they're going to put more money into the
pot
anyway if you want to play around with
this a little more uh link to this
spreadsheet is in the description also
in the presentation
and you'll just need to make a copy
to play with it yourself
next we're going to look at some GTO
wizard Solutions and reports to see how
you could implement this into your game
so here's a really common example of the
geometric bet size in practice
let's say you're playing the big blind
against button single race parts and for
this example I've selected Queen four
four but to be honest you'll see this in
a lot of spots where the button checks
back the flop
let's take a look at turn reports
the most common sizing when we do bet on
this type of texture is going to be
either block bet
or an over bet and it's 250 percent
what is special about 250 percent
well that just so happens to be the
geometric size for this spr over two
streets
so
let's pick I don't know an ace looks
like a pretty good example
now you don't want to do a lot of
betting on an ace you want to be
checking quite a bit but when you do bet
you're basically representing trips
or a bluff maybe a little bit of top
pair but for the most part trips
or a bluff we can see how this is
constructed
and
will note that
once we met 250 percent
button doesn't have a raising range they
don't need to when we bet this large
let's just pick some Brick River and
again it's the same fraction of the pot
on the river so we get to go
250
250 to get it all in this is a nice
smooth betting strategy that's going to
maximize the efficiency
of
how much money goes into the pot
conversely if you use something like
I don't know a 75 percent here
well
now it's almost impossible to construct
the realistic shoving range because it's
like 700 pot and if you do go for this
villain's overall calling range is gonna
be so much tighter that it's just not
realistically
a great strategy
so turn probes are by far one of the
most common spots where you'll see
geometric sizes in practice
um
particularly I think a lot of people
over Probe on the turn with small sizes
or medium sizes but realistically if
they're checking back a reasonable range
you want to use
a lot of turn over bets and in
particular
stuff that's closer to the geometric
size which is about 250 percent in this
case
here's another example
so this is a cut off versus pipeline
single race pot the Flop is A7 deuce
we start with a one-third bet
and I know what you're thinking Tom why
aren't they using the geometric size
here
I'll talk more about this later but
essentially you can't construct the
perfectly polarized range on the flop
your range is not perfectly polarized
in fact it's quite merged there's plenty
of medium hands in there so in practice
instead of starting with this extremely
nuts or Bluff strategy
it starts with a smaller size which has
the effect of clarifying your opponent's
range
after making this bet it's going to be
easier to construct a more polarized
range on turn and River
blind calls and let's give this King of
Spades now the reason I've chosen a King
of Spades is because this card is
gives you the least incentive to one a
bet small and that's because
your king X has literally nothing to
gain
by making another batch here
realistically it just folds out worse
and gets called by better and there's
already an ace on board so you're not
worried about being outdrawn by over
cards
so when your middling hands have no
incentive to bet that just leaves your
strong hands
and in that case you usually want to
construct something that consists of
extremely strong hands and Bluffs
which is perfect for the geometric bet
size
so here we see for example
we use a range of two pair very strong
top pair
and gut shots and some other
very weak draws
or just complete air as Bluffs
so the geometric bet size here is
something like 195 which is something in
between these two sizes maybe closer to
175.
and so the idea is that we can construct
this very strong polarized betting
strategy
again
big blind does not need to raise very
much at all facing these big over bets
that's because we're putting in so much
money into the pot that it's not
required
the check raise
and I've just given some Brick River
here
we can construct
the shoving strategy
so now that we've seen some examples
let's look at some big data here I've
got a flop report that contains
strategic information from every
possible flop
for this example I'm using the complex
Solutions
these Solutions are useful because they
have a ton of bad sizes and I can graph
those bad sizes and zoom in to get a
bigger picture
so
when I first
when I was first exploring this
I was quite surprised to see this
bimodal distribution that is to say in
this spot which is button versus big
blind single race pod
we see plenty of small sizes not a lot
of medium sizes
and then over bets why is that well it's
largely because you either start with
these small medium block bet sizes which
help clarify the ranges these are used
with less polarized strategies more
merged in these cases you typically
polarize on turn or river
or
on some occasions
you can construct polarized strategies
right from the Flop and these are going
to be closer to geometric remember the
geometric size here is about 116 so
somewhere between these two
however we see even larger sizes than
geometric and you might ask yourself
why is that you know you can't get more
polarized than perfectly polarized
and the answer to that question comes
down to draw Equity so instead of trying
to maximize villain's defending range it
may actually be worth it to
it may be more profitable if they
overfold on earlier streets when that
fold Equity is more valuable right you
can blast them off some draws
and that's why we see some really big
over bets in here
and in fact we can switch over to table
mode
and I'm just going to sort by
oh you know what I'm actually going to
group the actions together
sort by over bets
so Ace Queen 8 for example should be a
good one
and I'll ungroup these now
maybe I'll even graph them yeah I like
the graph here
so Ace Queen 8 is a fun one because we
can construct an extremely strong range
with very strong top Air hands
two pair
uh sets however there's also a ton of
draw Equity right there's flushes there
are straight draws there are gut shots
and so what the silver prefers instead
of a geometric size is something
slightly larger like 150 size bets or
even a 200.
and these are fun
because they have the effect
of blasting the big blind off a number
of their draws
maybe I just expand these for a second
you can see they're even folding some
flush draws off the bat
um
holding most of their gut shots
folding like
for example most of their second and
third pair and even some top pair which
all have outs against us
so
in practice you're never really
perfectly polarized or you're rarely
perfectly polarized
but you can still create very strong
hands and very weak hands and construct
the betting range like that
and instead of using a geometric size we
see it sometimes go even larger than
geometric for the purposes of denying
Equity early on
let's take a look at another example
so for example we can say uh
cut off opens
button
three bets cut off calls
so the geometric bet size here is about
65 percent
and if we take a look at what bet sizes
are preferred we note that everything's
kind of spread out here but it drops off
drastically after the geometric bet size
um this is a function of the lower spr
right like you're never going to see
these 150 over bets
on in like a three bed pot
because they're overkill for the spr so
we can use the geometric bed size to
gauge what is an appropriate bet size
for this spr and in this case it's you
know about two-thirds pot is close to
the maximum again we do see some larger
sizes to deny some of that draw equity
but for the most part
it's going to be about two-thirds spot
as a maximum so let's let's go ahead and
sort by that
find some examples
Ace Queen 10 is a good one
yeah so Ace Queen 10 is another similar
situation where
you have enough of a nut advantage that
you can construct very polarized ranges
it does go a little bit bigger because
there are again a lot of draws here
but if you go about 61
on each Street
then that's going to maximize
how wide cutoff calls
in the end
here we can see the geometric size would
be maybe 70 here and it's basically
splitting between these two
so
again you could kind of explore these
graphs
these flop reports
and you'll notice that the geometric bet
size is present in all of them
so now that we've discussed the
geometric sizing at length let's talk
about the elephant in the room
non-geometric strategies
why is it that hijack doesn't just bet
125 percent change why don't they just
try and make a perfectly polarized range
I mean if we look at the ranges tab
and check out the equity distribution we
can see they have a massive range
advantage throughout hijack has all the
strongest over cards they've got the
over pairs they've got the strong Jack X
but they don't have one important factor
that all important not Advantage you see
big blind
actually has the nuts they have all the
trips here and so if hijack were to use
this super polarized geometric betting
strategy right from the Flop that end up
narrowing themselves against this
extremely strong range where they're way
behind instead a much more effective
strategy is going to be using a smaller
size from the start and polarizing on
later streets so for example a 33
percent bet on this board forces an
interesting response
we can see that because the board is so
dry
big blind has to overfold a ton they're
folding 50
whereas MDF says they should fold
something like 25.
and in order to prevent hijack from
betting with impunity from just betting
any two cards
a big line needs to discourage them with
aggressive Check Racing
we can see them check raising 20 of
their range here
this has the effect of giving us
information right
when they check raise that's where
they're going to put most of their trips
some top pair and some Bluffs
and when they call their range is much
more condensed towards medium hands
right pairs made hands Ace highs stuff
like that
so we become more Clairvoyant when they
call
and that only happened because we forced
them to split their range by starting
with a small bet which forces this uh
check raise response
for that reason it's not always
effective to start with geometric
strategies sometimes it what the silver
will prefer is to start with smaller
bets on earlier streets and only
polarize on like turn and river or
sometimes it'll wait until the river
before it starts polarizing at all
something else to consider
and someone's definitely going to point
this out if I don't is that
the term value and Bluff is not well
defined on the flop if we take a look at
the equity
for example
top airtop kicker only has about 75
percent here
um even trips only about 90 so the value
is in pure value and the Bluffs aren't
pure Bluffs
you're not perfectly polarized
however in general
as you approach Showdown
your value will become closer to Pure
value and your Bluffs will become closer
to zero that is to say the equity tends
to crystallize on later streets that's
why in general
uh on the Flop you're gonna see smaller
sizes more merge strategies at first
because your ranges are naturally less
polarized
and your ranges will naturally become
more polarized on later streets
therefore geometric strategies and in
general just over bets you know nuts or
nothing betting strategies are more
common on turn and River than they are
on the flop
all right let's wrap this up so in
conclusion the geometric bet size is the
idea that you bet the same percentage
the same fraction of the pot on every
street in order to get Stacks in by the
river this has the effect of maximizing
villains defending range which maximizes
how much money they put into the pot
this strategy works best when your range
is polarized that's because your nutted
hands want to extract the most value
possible which happens when they defend
as wide as possible
I also noted that you can use the
geometric bet size to approximate stack
off ranges
and I've covered this in some of my
previous mechanics videos but
essentially if you compare their
defending range versus just shipping it
on one street versus spending an equal
fraction in all three streets
multiply the mdfs out
and you can roughly approximate how wide
they'll defend in total which can be
used to gauge the optimal strategy and
gauge the relative value of the nut
advantage
non-geometric strategies are used
because your betting range is not always
perfectly polarized these strategies are
best for pushing your middling equity
and gaining information Equity tends to
crystallize as you approach the river
that is to say your value becomes closer
to Pure value and your Bluffs become
closer to zero as you get further and
further towards Showdown we also saw
that betting larger than Geo is
sometimes used to fold out draw Equity
this is typically the case when
immediate folds are more valuable than
maximizing their calling range however
it is fairly rare in practice anyway
