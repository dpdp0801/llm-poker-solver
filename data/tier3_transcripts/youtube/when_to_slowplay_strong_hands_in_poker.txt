### TOPIC: when to slowplay strong hands in poker
Today, we'll be taking a deep dive
into the topic of slow playing
We'll break down the individual factors
that impact our decision to slow play
so that you can win the absolute maximum
the next time you hit a strong
hand.
These are the three main factors
we'll be discussing:
First of all,
we are more inclined to slow play,
when villain bets big as opposed to when he bets small.
Secondly, we are more inclined to slow
when we are in position.
And finally,
we are also more inclined to slow play
when the stack-to-pot ratio is slow.
Let's get into the first factor,
which is that
we are more inclined to slow play
when villain bets big.
And the reason for this
is that a big bet is actually
an indicator of a more polarized range.
Imagine if your opponent were to bet
big on the flop, for example,
Let’s say, a pot-sized bet,
He's probably not going to have hands
like middle pair and underpants
because those hands, for the most part,
just want to get to showdown.
And even if they did
want to bet for thin value or protection,
they typically wouldn’t use such a big size
because that's just
going to isolate themselves
against stronger hands, such as top pair.
So if you think about the composition
of the big bet range, it's
mostly either going to be very strong
hands or bluffs.
And this also means that the times
that you do call this big bat
then is very likely going to continue
barreling on the next street
because all of these strong value hands
that he has
are probably going
to want to continue betting.
And he's also going to have to mix
in a fair amount of his remaining
bluffs as well.
And that's actually great for slow playing
because the times
we have a strong hand,
we want the part to be as big as possible.
So we either do that by raising ourselves
or in this case, because our opponent
is so aggressive, the times that we call
it's actually a reasonable option
to just call and sort of
let him hang himself on the next street.
On the other hand,
if we had faced a smaller bet on the flop
then our opponent's range is 
typically going to be much more
polarized, is going to contain
all of these marginal hands
like middle pair and under pairs
that perhaps went to bet for protection.
But don't want to go that day.
So the composition of the small bet
is much more depolarized
and against such a depolarized range,
we typically don't want to do much slow playing
because we can expect the next street
to go check-check very often.
Most of these middle pair
and under pair type
patterns, they're really just going
to be checking behind on the turn.
If you call this up
because they've already accomplished what
they were trying to accomplish, right?
They've already folded out the over cards
that they’re trying to deny equity against.
And also the times that you call to the flop
your range becomes much stronger as well.
So a lot of these marginal hands
are not going to be strong enough
to consider making some kind of thin value
bet on the turn.
And so the times you have a nut hand
it's not going to be a great idea
to call the small bet
knowing that the turn is going to go
check-check so often.
Here's an example of this effect
on this ace-queen high board
button open versus big blank call.
You can see
Button is using two distinct sizes.
He has this over
bet that’s built around mostly hands
like two pair, stuff like stronger top pair
here there’s 25% top pair in the big bet range
You’ll notice that most of these top pair hands
are actually the ones
with the higher kickers
such as Ace King and Ace Jack
and really not that many marginal hands
because if Button did have a hand
like a queen, it just doesn't make sense
to go for such a huge bet.
You know,
And isolate yourself against all of the top
our hands and the big blinds range.
By contrast, if you take a look
at the composition of the small bet range,
you'll see that it's much more weighted
towards marginal hands.
Queen X is now 17% of the small bet range, and
there is a similar amount of top pair.
But if you take a look at the strength
of these top pair combos, you're notice
that it's actually mostly built around
top pair with weaker kickers.
Hands like A6 A5 that don’t have quite as much equity as AK AJ.
There’s also quite a bit less two pair, 
1.8% as opposed to 11%
when it comes to the big bet range.
And the overall effect is that
the button will just tend to barrel
the turn much more often
after betting big on the floor.
If we take a look
at what happens on a blank screen,
you can see Button is barreling
more than half the time.
And it's pretty clear why this happens.
If we look at what the various hand
classes in the buttons range are doing,
Hands like sets and two pairs, they're
really clear value bets on the turn.
And since most of the top pair
combos are actually stronger top pair
the hand class of top pair actually ends up
betting at quite a high frequency as well.
So there's barely any...
Not that many hands that are giving up.
Of course, you have to give up
like a little bit of air,
but that kind of depends on
how good or bad the turn is.
If the turn is like a deuce, it's
not like a great turn for the button
in the sense
that none of his bluffs really get there.
So that tends to be a little bit
more checking with air.
So to get a better idea of how aggressive
we expect
button to be on the turn,
we can also take a look at the turn.
Reports basically on average, button
is barreling a little bit
more than half the time, about 55%.
And what we also want to do
is compare this
with the barreling frequency
after button
makes the small bet on the flop.
So let's take a look.
Basically, we see that the
turn barrel frequency has gone down
by quite a big margin.
Button is now checking the turn
almost two-thirds of the time.
And the reason for this is that button
has way more marginal hands in his range.
So if we take a look at a blank turn,
for example
105
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:32,866
Button’s range is not just comprised of hands
like top-pair and two pair and sets.
There’s way less of those hands.
The top pair that he does have even
These hands they're weaker top pairs.
They are a little bit more inclined
to check the turn, and of course, he's going
to have like a whole bunch
of second pair and third pair hands.
that are pretty much
checking at 100% frequency.
It just makes very little sense to bet
QueenX on the third once again, because
you've already made the big blind range
quite strong by betting the flop.
So even something like KQ QJ is not going to have
quite enough equity
to be a comfortable value bet on the turn.
So all of these heads are going to pull
down Button's turn barrel frequency.
And if you think about the effect
that this has
on the big blind strong hands
and now if we go back to the flop
knowing that button is
going to check back
so much after you call this small bet,
it really doesn't make
a whole lot of sense
to call something like two pair
or a set on the flop.
Whereas if you were facing a bigger bet
with these hands
then now you can see
the Big Bang is doing much more slow playing.
because the big bet
is much more polarized.
And you can
you can sort of count on the button
to continue
being very aggressive on the turn.
Probably the only exception to
this would be top and bottom.
You can see A7
It's not raising quite as often
as the rest of our nut combos.
And this is actually a pretty common trend
and something that you'll see solvers
do a lot.
They like to specifically slow play
the top and bottom pair.
And my interpretation of this is that top
button is just quite a unique
hand in the sense that it is not quite
as strong as top two pair,
but at the same time, it doesn't
do as good of a job as unblocking
your opponent's calling range
compared to a hand like bottom two pair,
because most of your opponents calling
range is going to be hands like A6.
So A7 actually blocks
a pretty good chunk of that.
So there's a lot of situations
where we even end up raising like certain
top pair combos
a little bit more than top and bottom.
You'll see stuff like AJ raising more
because even though A7 is a stronger
hand, but still
it's a lot less vulnerable hand compared
to AJ. 
We actually end up
denying a little bit more equity
when we raise a hand like AJ
because we fold out some and such as QJ and QT
that are drawing.
I guess they're not drawing dead to A7,
but they're definitely drawing a lot thinner
because they only have two outs
to hit a queen.
Whereas if we have something like AJ
we actually don't really mind folding out
AT and A9. Then of course
we would probably rather they call.
But the thing is
that these hands have five outs against us,
so it's a little bit more acceptable
to be folding them out.
It's just a little bit more value that
we're getting in terms of equity denial.
But still, it's not a big deal.
The main takeaway here is that two-pair+ as a handclass should be raising
much more often versus the smaller size
because if we just called,
we know that the turn is going to go
check-check really often.
And basically you have a situation
where your opponent is not really
putting in the money for you.
So you just have to put in the money
yourself by check-raising the flop
and fast play in your head.
Here's a question
to test your understanding
On a board of K72 rainbow
facing a small cbet,
Should the big line a) fast
play his sets to build the pot, 
b) Slowplay his sets to keep bluffs in.
The main difference, compared to the previous
example, is that the bar is extremely dry.
There is a complete lack of straight
draws and flush draws,
so most of buttons
bluffs are not going to have
a whole lot of equity against the big blind’s
sets.
In fact, they're mostly just drawing dead
or drawing to runner-runner.
So the question is really
whether this justifies slow playing
just to keep all of these
drawing dead hands in the buttons
range
and hope that they continue bluffing.
So you can take a few moments
to think about this
and I'll show the answer in a bit.
So it turns out that
the texture of the board
doesn't really affect our decision
that much.
And the main consideration
here is once again, how polarized
or how depolarized our opponents
betting range is.
As long as he's betting small on the flop,
his betting
range is always going to contain
a whole lot of marginal hands,
such as underpair's
second or third pair.
In this case, Ace High is definitely
consider a marginal hand as well.
Hands like AQ and AJ
actually have a lot of showdown
value on this type of board texture.
And if we take a look at what these hands
tend to do on the turn after we call,
you can actually see
that they're checking behind
pretty much all the time.
So once again, the presence
of all of these marginal hands
is pulling down the buttons,
turn barrel frequency,
and this makes it really important
for the big blind
to just fast play his strong hands on the flop.
And this is also something
that is independent of the board texture.
Whether the board is wet or dry,
it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense
to slow play your strong hand
knowing that your opponent is not going
to be very aggressive on the next street.
And that's the reason
why two pair with us as a hand
class is raising at such a high frequency.
A more legitimate question would be:
what happens
if my opponent is over
folding versus the check-raise?
Does that actually justify
slow playing my strong hands?
Because in this case,
the EV of your strong hands
does actually go down,
especially on the board like this.
I doubt most viewers will be calling
Hands like JTo
There’s quite a bit of ace high
that's supposed to be floating as well.
And if your opponent
is not going to call these hands,
then for sure the EV of raising
your strong hands is going to go down,
but it's still a little bit unclear
if that's enough to make us
want to slow play this type of hand.
Because if you take a look
at the EV of a hand like 22,
for example, raising is actually quite
a bit higher than calling.
EV of raising  is 18.1
EV of calling is 17.4.
So for sure if your opponent is over-folding,
Then the EV of raising
is going to be less than 18.1.
But it's quite difficult to say for sure
if it's going to be less than 17.4.
And don't forget that your opponent
could also be making certain mistakes
two times that you call, for example,
if we take a look at
what's supposed to happen on the turn
after we call the cbet,
you'll see that in-position
is actually using quite a significant
frequency of over bets,
especially on some of these higher
turns like the queen.
What you'll see is that
button is actually supposed to be betting,
you know, 2.5x pot and 1.8x pot
and 1.8
at a decent percentage of the time.
So if you don't expect your opponents
to be doing this, then
it's actually also going
to decrease the EV of calling the flop.
If we go back to our flop decision
Hands like 22, obviously
when you call,
you're kind of hoping that your opponent
will be as aggressive as possible.
But now that he's
failing to do this, EV of 
calling is definitely going to go down.
So my point is really that
even if our opponent is over folding versus the check-raise
Yes, the EV of check-raising  is going to go down,
but that doesn't automatically mean
that it is going
to be lower than the EV of calling.
So to me, the correct response versus
someone who is over overfolding
is not to start
slow playing your strong hands,
but rather to still continue
check raising them, andt
to check raise
a whole lot of bluffs as well.
So what we're doing
is kind of forcing our opponent
to pay off our value hands
because of the presence of these bluff like 8s 96s.
These bluffs force our opponent to call the flop with hands like JT and Ace high.
Even if he doesn't want to call these hands
that's fine with us as well.
Yes, the idea of our strong hands
is going to go down, but at least we have
all these bluffs to recoup the
EV that our value hands are losing.
So it's a little bit like buying insurance
if you think about it,
in real life,
we buy insurance because we're worried
that something might go wrong,
that we might fall sick
and no one's
really going to buy insurance.
If you knew with 100% certainty
that you were not going to fall sick.
So it's the same in poker.
We bluff, really,
because we are worried that our opponent
might be overfolding.
And if we knew for sure that he was
always going to defend or at least what
solve or would defend, there would be
absolutely no reason to be bluffing.
And so that's why it's so important
to be bluffing in this type of situation
where you know that your opponent needs
to make a lot of counterintuitive calls
and there's a real risk
that he might not be calling
these hands like JT and Ace high.
It's just type of situation
where it's really important
to have some kind of insurance
and to be bluffing enough hands
so that in the event
that your opponent does overfold,
at least you have some kind of insurance
payout from all of the backdoor type hands
that actually benefit from your opponent's
higher folding frequency.
The second factor is that you are more
inclined to slow play when in position
and I think this is quite intuitive
It feels quite natural to
just call a bet with a strong hand
if you're in position, specifically
because the times that...
even in the worst case scenario
where your opponenet checks the next street,
you still have the option
of putting in a bet yourself
Whereas if you are out of position facing
a flop bet
now it becomes much riskier to be slowplaying
because there's always the worry
that your opponent
might check behind on the next street
and now we're just going to go straight
to the river and the pot's
actually going to be pretty small,
which obviously is not a great thing
for your strong hand.
If we take a look at this in position 3bet pot,
you'll see that CO's response
vs a cbet is very similar
to some of the previous examples
we've been looking at, not just because
the cbet size is small,
but also
because CO is out of position.
He's quite inclined to just raise
hands like 22 and 88
because once he fails to do this,
there is the risk
that the turn is going to go check check,
and then the button will be allowed
to bluffcatch the river in a very small pot.
So the only way for the CO to spoil
this plan is just to checkraise
all of the strong hands aggressively
and then to mix in a bunch of bluffs.
Whereas if we compare this
to out of position 3bet
So over here we have SB 3bet 
vs CO instead
And the way that CO responds versus
SB's cbet is actually quite different.
Most of his strong ends
are actually electing to slowplay
in this case, since there is no danger
of the turn checking through the times
that the CO just calls this bet.
Even in the worst case scenario,
where the SB
does decide to check the turn,
the CO can still easily
put in a turn bet himself.
So in that sense
it makes slowplaying a lot less riskier.
The third and final factor is
that we are more inclined to slow play
when the stack to pot ratio is low.
Generally speaking, our strong hands
have two opposing incentives.
On one hand,
they want to fastplay to build the pot,
but on the other hand
they're also hands that
make a lot of sense to slowplay,
because the stronger
your hand is, the less vulnerable
it tends to be.
And if you think about how SPR affects
each of these factors,
as stacks get deeper and deeper,
it actually becomes much more important
to be fastplaying to build the pot
because you just tend to win
so much the times
that you stack your opponent.
And that's the reason
why we typically don't do as much
slowplaying when SPR is high
just because this first factor of 
fastplaying and building
the pot is so much more important
than still playing to keep bluffs in.
Whereas in a low SPR situation, there's
much less of an upside to fastplaying
since even if you did manage
to stack your opponent,
you're not going to win that big of a pot
anyway.
So the second factor of slow
playing to keep bluffs in
becomes a little bit
more important by comparison.
Here we have an out of position 3bet pot,
but the flop is QT9r
And because we're 200bb deep,
we see that button actually plays
very straightforward and very aggressively
with most of his strong hands
especially when you look at ends like KJ
that are not very vulnerable
these hands are just raising most of the time
because even though they don't deny much
equity or need much protection,
but at the end of the day,
the stacks are so deep that we just win
such a huge pot the times
that we do manage to stack our opponent.
So this is what gives us more incentive
to just go ahead and raise our hand.
Whereas in a 40bb situation,
what we should see is that button
should be
a lot more inclined to slowplay with
hands like KJ, especially
because now there's much less of an upside
to raising to build the pot.
Even the times that you do
stack your opponent,
you're not going to win
that much anyway.
So the focus shifts to slowplaying
to keep bluffs in.
The last thing you want to do
with a hand like KJ is to raise
and fold out all of these trash hands
such as A high and small pocket pairs
Given that there's very limited upside
to raising anyway, it becomes much
more important to just call and keep
all of these hands in, hope that your opponent
perhaps hits an ace on the turn
or even if he doesn't, there's
always some chance that these hands
might continue to bluff you if you call.
So overall, calling
is just going to generate much more value
compared to raising
and just folding all of these hands out.
And I also want to emphasize
that this would be true
even if the board was twotone.
So if we change this
to the nine of diamonds,
what we see is that the BTN is
not really...
he's still not very interested in raising hands
like straights and sets versus a Cbet,
which definitely looks a little bit
strange because from a human perspective,
a hand like 99 feels quite vulnerable.
There's so many turn cards
that we don't want to see, any K
or J or diamond is definitely going
to devalue our hand.
So instinctively
it feels like we should just be raising
and trying to get the money
in before one of these bad cards come.
But of course, the reason
why the solver doesn't do that is
because it knows that raising
doesn't really solve the problem.
A lot of the hands that you're trying
to protect against, like flush draws
and straight draws, they're just not going
to be folding against this raise.
So when we raise with a head like 99,
it's actually almost like a pure value raise
because the only hands that
have a significant number of outs
against us, such as flush drwas
and open enders, you can see
that they're just continuing
100% of the time.
So 99 is really not as vulnerable
as it looks
And for this type of hand
that doesn't deny a lot of equity,
The only time that we want to fastplay it
is when the stacks are deep enough such
that there's a big enough upside
when it comes to building the pot
because in that case,
we would actually win enough the times
that we stack our opponent to offset
the fact that raising doesn't accomplish
anything in terms of protection.
Quiz question number two
SB 3bet vs BTN,
on a board of T63
SB cbets the flop
and BTN calls, and on this flush
completing turn, which hand
does BTN prefer to raise versus
a double barrel?
So if your answer was B, well done!
So far we've seen that as the SPR gets lower,
it becomes very difficult to justify
raising hands that don't need protection,
even if the hand itself is very strong.
And this is exactly why BTN is choosing
to slow play all of his flushes versus
the double barrel.
The SPR is so low at this point
that raising to build
the pot isn't really a factor.
And of course, flushes are just hands
that are not very vulnerable.
Even a head like 45hh
that looks quite vulnerable
doesn't deny as much equity
as you might think,
because if you take a look at the SB's
response versus our raise, he's
not really folding that many hands
with equity against us.
The main hands our hand is vulnerable
to would be higher flush
draws, hands like 2p and sets
but 2p and sets...
obviously not going to fold
and also a lot of the higher flush draws
actually come with a pair
so there are hands like QQ and JJ
with a heart, KhTx
And none of these hands are also going
to fold, given how little money
there is behind. Even something
like KxJh
against our specific hand,
this is really just a naked flush draw
because its straight
draw outs are not live, the times
that KJ hits a Q
it's still going to be dead
to our flush and the flush draw itself
is not even like a proper flush draw
because we're holding 2 hearts in our hand
and so we're essentially left
with a seven outer
And the question is really
whether it's worth it
or it's justified to be raising our 45
just to fold out a couple of hands
with 7 out, or is it more efficient
to be calling with our flush
and just to keep all of these hands
like KJ/KQ, that are drawing
stone dead versus our hand and hope
that they continue bluffing on the river
and this also explains
why sets are raising more often
on the turn compared to flushes.
Because when we raise a hand like 66
or 33, it actually
accomplishes much more in the sense
that all these hands that are folding,
they have way more outs against us compared
to the times that we hold a flush.
A hand like KJ with a heart,
now it's no longer a naked flush draw
This is actually a combo draw
because it can hit a queen or
a heart of the river,
it has a ton of outs against our set
So pretty big win the times
that we manage to fold out this hand
even a hand like KQ
without the heart, no longer
drawing that against our set, and stuff
like 77 with a heart as
well, this is also going to have a fair
number of outs against us.
It's basically a flush draw plus a two
outer, which is like 11 outs already.
So when we take a look at the BTN's
response versus a double barrel,
you'll see that sets in particular 66
and 33, the more vulnerable sets.
They are in fact raising
at quite a high frequency.
And I also want to compare this
to the 200bb
solution
Let's take a look
at how things change as the SPR gets higher.
So now we actually see a very
different situation where our flushes
are raising at a much higher frequency.
And this is happening
despite the fact that flushes are,
as we've seen, not very vulnerable
hands
But of course, the difference
is that with the higher SPR,
there's now
a much larger upside to raising
and stacking your opponent
and the times that you do manage to get it
and against a worse hand,
you're
just going to win a much bigger pot.
So that's going to compensate for the fact
that your hand doesn't
really deny that much equity.
The last example I want to look at
is this 4BP over here
on this T high board
you can see that versus a BTN
cbet, SB
is doing a ton of slow playing
hands like sets as well as the less
vulnerable overpairs like AA
There's just very little reason
to be fastplaying these hands
there's so little upside to raising
and building the pot given the low SPR.
So once again, the focus lies in calling
just to keep all of these random
overcards in the BTN's range.
But something else you'll notice about
the SB's raising range
is that it's very weighted
towards 1p hands.
So heads like top pair, for example,
make up a huge chunk of the SB's
raising range and you can see Tx is
actually raising at a very high frequency.
There's even hands like 99 and 88
getting in there sometimes.
And the reason why this is happening
is that these one pair hands
have a very different set
of opposing incentives.
On one hand,
they definitely want to be raising
for protection just to be able to fold out
hands like KQ and AJ
That's a pretty big win for us
to deny six outs
worth of equity against these hands.
But on the other hand,
the times that we raise
and we wun into a hand like Aces
our Kings,
we're definitely getting stacked
There's just no getting away
our opponent's going to jam
And we're definitely just going to call
given the SPR
So that's always the dilemma
when you have some kind of 1p
hand,
do you want to raise for protection
or do you want to just call
and lose the minimum
the times that you run into
a better hand
And if you think about how SPR affects
each of these factors,
it actually makes you much more inclined
to raise for protection
because even if you happen
to run into an overpair
and you get stacked by a hand
like AA or KK, you're just not going
to lose that much compared to
if the SPR was higher.
So basically
you're getting much better pot odds
on your protection check raise
and this is why you'll see SB
playing like a maniac,
just raising all of these hands like 88/99,
raising stuff like 67
with the intention of getting it in
This is something
that we're pretty much only allowed to do
when the SPR is low
And so your whole strategy becomes really odd,
everything is kind of upside down.
Your really strong hands like sets
are just calling all the time and your 1p
hands like Tx and 88/99
are just raising really often.
Whereas in a situation
where the SPR is higher
than everything starts
to look a lot more normal.
Our very strong hands
have much more incentive to be raising
and building the pot
and our more marginal one pair hands
probably will be raising
at some frequency,
but we definitely don't
want to be overdoing it
given how much more we're going to lose
the times that we run into a better hand.
