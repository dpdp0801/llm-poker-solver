### TOPIC: where does ev come from in poker
where does expected value come from  
in this video I'm going to show you how to 
think ahead so you can get ahead in poker
hey everyone before we start the video 
we'd really appreciate it if you could  
hit the like And subscribe buttons your support 
means a lot to us thank you and enjoy the video  
so where does expected value come from this is 
the most important question you can ask yourself  
in poker if you don't understand how your hand 
makes money then how do you expect to make money  
with your hand right it's a very simple yet 
deceivingly complex question and we're going  
to tackle it today so first of all why is this 
important well consider this the expected value  
of early Street actions depends heavily on how you 
play Future streets that is to say you know maybe  
it's a an indifferent pre-flop decision but if 
you're butchering it on turn and River well it's  
no longer a zero EV call now is it future mistakes 
May well cost you more value than the recommended  
earlier Street action is predicted to earn you 
in theory right like some hens you're expected  
to find these counter-intuitive Bluffs or very 
thin calls or thin value bets lays that you might  
have trouble finding but if you don't find those 
plays then are these hens actually going to pay  
off as much as the solver says they will for more 
information about this I reckon recommend reading  
this counter-intuitive calls article by Andrew 
brocos it's fantastic Link in the description  
this has inspired my video today so we'll start 
with a simple outline first of all we've chatted  
about why this is important now we're going to 
look at Redline versus Blue Line analysis and  
then I'll show you a few simple techniques I'm 
going to use a combination of run out analysis  
as well as just some basic look ahead techniques 
to show you how you can think about where your  
hands value actually comes from expected value 
in poker can be categorized as coming from one  
of two sources blue line which is money won 
or lost that Showdown or Redline which is  
money won or lost before Showdown those are the 
only two ways to win in poker right so which of  
these two is more important should you be 
a blue line knit or a Redline Maniac well  
ultimately it's the green line that matters but 
this has been a common question since well since  
Huds came have come out so let's try and give it 
a definitive answer today we're going to start  
with a baseline six GTO Bots play a reckless game 
for millions and millions of hands they're all  
rotating seats they all play the same strategy 
so what's the end result if you take a look at  
any one of their graphs would their blue line 
be higher than the red line would the red line  
be higher than the blue line or would the lines 
be the same take a moment to consider your answer
foreign
ly the answer is a the Blue Line would be higher 
than the red line why is this well the answer is  
that it's a multi-weight game there are six of 
them playing in a six Max game If This Were heads  
up these two lines would be the same because well 
they're playing the same strategy but multi-way is  
not quite the same as heads up now is it let's 
take a look at this graph this was sent in by  
my dear colleague Matt Roberts what he did is he 
ran just an ungodly amount of pile Sims and then  
using custom Code E exported those hands into 
hand to note which is a hand tracker and showed  
what the win rate for a GTO bot would be playing 
against other GTO Bots and as you can see the Blue  
Line the money one at Showdown is much greater 
than the red line You'll also notice a few other  
things about this graph one is that it's not quite 
at zero I think this is because there's a little  
bit of rake included the other is that it's it's 
very patchy and this is because the Sims were run  
as reports and then shipped out in batches but 
it's very interesting to see just how much more  
the blue line is than the red line now let's ask 
some simple questions Showdown versus non-showdown  
winnings we need to ask how one can transfer 
from one to the other now Blue Line cannot be  
transferred to redline without mistakes however 
Redline can be transferred to Blue Line without  
mistakes and this is the key difference any 
two set of strategies as long as everybody at  
the table is playing the same strategy doesn't 
even have to be GTO the blue line should always  
be higher than the red line unless you're playing 
you know some absurd rake structure and this for  
the simple fact that you're going to steal the 
blinds a lot right so for example button opens  
small blindfolds big blind calls the button in 
the big blind go to Showdown and the button wins  
at Showdown we have just provided a very simple 
and very common path for the red line to go to the  
Blue Line multi-way pots allow this transfer from 
red to blue very simply however there is no path  
from Blue to Red unless some player is making 
a mistake unless players are playing different  
strategies there's no way to go from Blue to 
Red not when you average it out over the long  
term that is to say playing the same strategy in 
every spot in every position there's no way to go  
from Blue to red but there is a way to go from 
red to blue just due to multi-weight Dynamics  
okay so why am I telling you this well we now 
know that in a GTO solution in a multi-way game  
GTO Bots will have a blue line win rate right 
most of their weddings will come from Showdown  
value and this is just due to the fact that 
the blinds cost them a lot of money to keep  
folding right this is to be expected now does this 
mean that everyone should be a blue line player  
absolutely not no that's not what I'm saying there 
are plenty of Crushers out there who are Redline  
winners these are guys that they take it down in 
a lot of spots they pick their spots wisely they  
know in the population's over under bluffing 
there's plenty of Redline Warriors out there  
and similarly there's plenty of very strong Blue 
Line players out there I think most people playing  
micro to low stakes pretty much all the winners at 
that stake are going to have a very high Blue Line  
reason I'm telling you this is because we need 
a baseline from which to adjust from if you're  
playing six Max poker and you see a Redline player 
they're typically doing something special because  
this doesn't occur if everyone's playing the same 
strategy right it all right let's set aside the  
theoretical implications of red versus blue line 
it's a really interesting topic but it's not what  
I want to focus on today I want to give you more 
practical advice in general we want to know where  
EV comes from and to do this you must examine 
future streets can't understand how your hand  
derives money unless you look ahead I'm going 
to show you a few simple techniques for looking  
ahead to understand where that EV comes from I'm 
going to teach you a simple technique you can use  
to visualize how your hand makes money step one 
choose one hand focus on step two is to graph that  
hand's expected value across different turn cards 
step three is to compare how the expected value of  
that hand changes across different turns to how 
the strategy changes so what turns does our hand  
make the most money and what turns are we being 
the most aggressive and you'll find that those  
two do not always coincide lastly we're going to 
investigate Rivers whenever we run into something  
kind of weird or counterintuitive so the purpose 
of this method is to start on the Flop and look  
at head to Future streets in order to understand 
where our value comes from all right that's enough  
talk it'll become more clear with an example let's 
open GTA Wizard and see how the solver applies  
these concepts for the first example I've chosen a 
button versus big blind King 852 tone flop checks  
to us on the button and we have a fairly mixed 
strategy here so again the way this works is we're  
going to focus on one particular hand and hence 
I want to focus on are three three what sticks  
out to me about three three are that we're betting 
three three with a club not so much without a club  
now why is that it could it be because we blocked 
flash draws or potentially maybe we have cleaner  
outs maybe it's because we can at a club turn 
and then we have a chance to hit a backdoor  
flush draw well let's find out which of these 
factors actually matters we'll start with the  
blocker hypothesis you go to the ranges tab you 
can see how many combinations each player has  
we're looking at 500 combinations in the buttons 
range 350 in the big lines the ranges are far too  
wide here for these blocker effects to have any 
real meaning you block maybe six combinations  
of flush draws it really doesn't matter at this 
point ranges are too wide right maybe it becomes  
important later probably not that much blockers 
matter when ranges are tight because then they  
have the most effect in terms of card removed 
when Rangers are wide blockers don't matter them  
okay so if it's not blockers maybe it's to do 
with our hand hits turns and rivers back door  
flush draws or cleaner outs for example so the 
way to test this is we're gonna bet get called  
and open up turn reports so here I'm just going to 
select reports and we're going to apply a filter  
okay I'm going to select three 
of clubs three of diamonds  
and I want to look at the buttons expected value 
with three of clubs three of diamonds so you  
can look at one player or the other or both at 
the same time I'm just going to look at button  
and you know what let's just go ahead and sort 
this by isdv to lowest D so here on on the left  
hand side I'm looking at the expected value of 
button when they hold pocket threes across all  
of these different turn cards and obviously you 
know hitting that beautiful beautiful two outer  
is going to be the highest EV followed 
only by hitting a backdoor flush draw  
so here's the thing what happens if instead of 
three of Clubs we have for example let's say three  
of Hearts three of diamonds so we don't have that 
club anymore no more backdoor flush draws uh well  
let's see what happens well notice the most 
interesting change is well first of all these  
clubs are now very bad for us but second of all 
look at what happens to our two major outs three  
we just lost half our value on the three of clubs 
turn I know it's weird to think of a pocket pair  
as a draw but realistically an enormous chunk of 
your value with this hand just comes from hitting  
that two outer right so when one of our outs 
is poisoned in this case hitting our set also  
completes our opponent's flush draws that's 
going to severely detract from how much value  
we can get from this and so that's why if we go 
back to the flop yeah you can see why the silver  
is more inclined to build a pot with the types 
of hens that when they actually hit a big hand  
and play for Stacks right let's do something else 
here I'm going to change this to horizontal View  
and all this does is it shows each combination 
separately and I'm going to focus on in particular  
pocket pairs so I want to look at these low pairs 
maybe these under pairs Maybe these third pairs  
so let's take a look at some of these now you 
may be a little confused as to how to read this  
the combinations in red here on the right hand 
side these have a club as shown down here left  
hand side do not have a club so we'll notice that 
all of these pocket pairs seem to prefer to bet  
with a club and it's the same heuristic right some 
of them have more or less blocker properties some  
of them have stronger back door flush draws but 
the analysis is the same the biggest Reason by far  
is just that you have cleaner outs to a set the 
second biggest reason is having a backdoor flush  
Trail now how much this impacts you is largely 
dependent on how deep stacked you are if you're  
200 Big lines deep well the back door flush for 
Equity might actually become more valuable not by  
itself but in aggregate across all turns anyway 
that's just a simple example of how you can use  
simple run out analysis to understand where your 
hands value comes from and why the silver might  
prefer putting certain cards in some lines in 
certain cards in other lines okay for our second  
example I have chosen a cut off versus big blind 
single race pot King 76 rainbow checks the cutoff  
who bets half pot and this is a reasonable size we 
can see that they're doing this with good portion  
of their range actions on us in the big blind 
now again for this technique to work you really  
need to focus in on one card before you try and 
extrapolate anything and I've chosen Ace 8 suited  
why have I chosen this hand well because it's kind 
of interesting it's check raising almost half the  
time here right so how does a state of diamonds 
actually make money through a check race line  
let's take a look so we'll raise cut off calls 
and let's go take a look at these turn reports  
now again what you want to do is Select expected 
value this is big blind's expected value and  
filter for the hand that you want to mess with 
okay and you know what let's simplify this further  
for a second I'm going to sort by cards here so 
this represents all the two turns three turns four  
turns five turns and so on and we can see that 
some cards have greater EV obviously hitting an  
ace is fantastic we just made top pair we just out 
Drew villain stop pair what about an eight though  
we check raise a state Suited we hit an eight no 
this is one of the worst possible turns for us we  
would rather have a brick the reason is that we 
didn't check raise this hand try and make second  
pair we didn't check raise an a to try and hit it 
eight we check raised it because we wanted to hit  
a draw we wanted to hit an open Ender a gut shot 
we wanted to hit for example a backdoor flush draw
these are where our hand actually makes money  
actor flush draws turns that give us some 
straight draw potential or hitting an ace when  
you check raise you're essentially saying to your 
opponent that you are wanting to play for Stacks  
you're representing a very polarized range that's 
ready to play aggressively on a lot of runouts so  
you don't really want to flop a bunch of medium 
strength ads here all right let's take a look at  
Aces here we check raise we hit Top 
pair what does our strategy look like  
well notice that we're mostly just checking on an 
ace right this is the highest EV turn card for us  
and yet we're mostly just checking this is an 
important thing to keep in mind the highest  
EV turn card is not the one you should be the 
most aggressive on the ones you should be the  
most aggressive on in a check race line anyway 
are the boards where you can build a pot are  
the boards for you and potentially brought to the 
nuts and out draw the top of your opponents range  
backdoor diamonds backdoor straights and such 
so it's important to recognize where this EV  
comes from before you start playing a check raise 
with Ace 8 because if you don't know what cards  
you're supposed to barrel with if you don't 
understand the idea that you're playing for  
a polarized Equity well then you probably don't 
really understand how to play this spot and if  
you check raise it anyway you're just gonna 
set money on fire right so this is why it's  
really important to think about how does my hand 
generate money now we can extrapolate this further  
for example take a look at ace5 here this one's 
Check Racing a bunch seems like a weird check  
raise but I guarantee you it's the same heuristic 
check raising here because the 5 connects with the  
six and the Seven because the Spade connects with 
the King of Spades so you can hit that backdoor  
flush draw those backdoor straight draws and 
you're going to see this heuristic come up a ton  
right so anyway hopefully that makes sense for 
this next example I've chosen a button versus  
big blind single race pod on Ace 76 rainbow 
checks to us on the button and we've got an  
interesting mixed strategy going on now one 
hand that sticks out to me in particular is  
king queen both off suit and suited you notice 
that these King X hands are checking back a lot  
is that well first of all you know it's a medium 
strength hand but there's more to it than that  
what happens if we bet I think a lot of players 
just by habit would range bet this board but what  
does king queen actually came by betting uh well 
first of all you fold out a whole lot of these  
King X and queen X hands and I would ask the 
viewer is this a good thing do you want to fold  
out these hands probably not right why do you want 
to fold out the very hands you dominate imagine  
you hit a king or a queen you can extract value 
from these hands secondly you just hard block the  
folding range so you don't get nearly enough fold 
Equity but okay let's challenge this assumption  
what happens if we check back how does our hand 
actually make money in the checking line so what  
I'm going to do is I'm going to select a button 
check and again we're going to go to turn reports  
so I'll say big blind checks and again let's 
apply a filter for let's say King Queen of Clubs  
no back door plus draw equity on King Queen 
of Clubs okay so here I'm showing the expected  
value of the button across all the turn cards and 
obviously you know a king or a queen are going to  
be high and stuff that gives us a draw like a 
tenora jack also decent cards something else to  
realize is that a six or seven any board pairing 
card actually pretty good for king queen and  
the reason for this is simply than you might 
imagine it's just that we were already beaten  
by a six a seven or an ace so when that pairs 
it just reduces the amount of combinations  
our opponent can have and doesn't add an extra 
board card that our opponent can connect with  
so we reduce the number of combos that already 
beat us and don't add any more cards that can  
potentially now beat us so board pairing cards 
for all completing cards or Draw giving cards  
obviously a king or a queen and some bricks at 
the bottom now what cards do we really hate to see  
stuff that adds more draws or connects with the 
middle of the range so a four a five eight or  
nine all of these cards connect with this seven 
and the six uh which is going to benefit big  
blinds range quite a bit and these are not the 
type of cards we want so these are the lowest EV  
cards okay let's compare this to the strategy 
so I want you guys to take a moment and think  
do you think we bet more on a king a queen 
or some other card which turn card should  
we delay C bet the most often take a moment to 
consider your answer king queen or something else  
let's take a look at the strategy again 
I'm filtering for King Queen of Clubs here  
on the turn the answer is a jack we Barrel 
most often on a jack right and this is because  
okay yeah we're barreling on a king but it's like 
a really small size we're you know over betting on  
a jack a lot more money goes in on some of these 
draw completing cards so tenor Jack comes in these  
are the type of turns that give us polarized 
Equity these are the type of turn cards that  
mean we now have the option to start playing for 
big Stacks we can't do that on for example a queen  
or King because we have second pair you don't 
play for Stacks with second pair right maybe you  
can bet for thin value but you certainly don't 
over bet so the highest Eevee turn card is not  
the turn card that you want to bet most often okay 
so you might be asking yourself given that we're  
checking back the turn 95 of the time what was 
the point of checking flop well now we need to  
examine this a bit more deeply let's choose a 
brick just for fairness sake I'm going to select  
this card this is uh the deuce of whatever 
the deuce of brick and you can see here that  
big blind they're gonna check a lot on most turn 
cards checks to us and we could see king queen  
is peer checking right so we're not checking 
we're pure checking flop for Pure checking  
turn how does our hand actually make money then 
let's just go to some random River Card eight  
is not a great card for us by the way I chose 
that at random let's say that it checks to us
we're checking down in Queen is a fine hand 
checkdown right fifty percent equity here what  
are you talking about that's great and let's 
say that for example we Face a block bet king  
queen is now indifferent but we can still Bluff 
catch okay what happens on for example a queen
so let's say it's a queen it checks 
we can now go for some Thin value  
with our king queen suited and what 
happens for example if we now face  
some bad sales I'm going to choose 73 here well 
now we can pick off a bunch of Bluffs right  
so king queen is going to generate most of its 
money by just checking down to be honest then  
the vast majority of lines can queen off 
suit on this type of board will check down  
so why did we want to check 
back the flop in the first place  
it's because there's already an ace on the board 
when we bet we're not folding an ace there's no  
other over cards to fold out right so what was 
the purpose of trying to bet a hand like king  
queen suited other than to fold out hands you 
already Dominate and get called by better right  
instead take this medium strength hand and check 
it down and the way we discovered that was through  
simple turn reports all right that was a lot to 
take in but hopefully you guys got something from  
it if you have any questions or need something 
clarified please feel free to ask questions in  
our Discord server Link in the description it's a 
great community and a great place to ask questions  
anyway that's my video guys hope you enjoyed it 
thanks for watching and as always happy grinding
