### TOPIC: gto analysis
hello and welcome this is tom for gto
wizard and today we're gonna dive into
the two plus two scene and analyze some
of our very own wizards hand histories
stay tuned
we asked two plus two to send us the
most interesting hand histories to be
analyzed in a gto wizard video and today
we're gonna do just that
this first hand comes to us from new guy
here who's battling it out in the 50 nl
streets let's dive right in
so our hero new guy here is sitting in
the big blind with a stews off small
blind opens it up to three bigs and he
makes the call ace 8 7 rainbow flop
checks through king of clubs on the turn
and small blind over bets new guy here
is not phased he makes the call brick
river small blind puts in another large
bet and new guy calls it down
correctly villain shows the missed
double gut shot bluff and you guys
scoops the pot so what do you guys think
of this call down was it close was it
good was it a clear snap call and were
there any reads involved well let's dive
into the analysis and take a look
so the first thing i like to do when
analyzing a hand is start with the
aggregate reports these reports contain
information from all possible flops and
the reason i like to start here is
because these reports give me great
heuristics that i can generalize in game
for example we see that small blind
rarely uses one of these larger sizes
typically starting out with a check or a
small bet small blind should play
defensively here and not over extend
right on the flop otherwise their wide
range is going to be very hard to defend
on later streets
when they do check
big blind typically sizes up they are
using 66 as the preferred size as well
as checking back a decent percentage
mixing in over bets and smaller bets
this is because generally you have
position and small blind has capped
themselves to some degree after they've
checked one street
so we can even go back and apply some
filters just to see how this applies in
game for example we can
just broadly apply i don't know ace high
with some middling cards
and let's say it's
not monotone not paired
as you can see the small blind strategy
typically prefers a smaller bet or a
check here very few larger bets the
middling cards are going to hit big
blind's range better and the ace high on
board decreases the value of fold equity
with your top pair so generally speaking
these types of textures prefer a smaller
bet or a check
once they do check back on big blind
typically going to prefer an over bet
targeting the middle of their range
those capped hands
so let's take a look at the actual
strategies on this board here we can see
that most of the strong top pair in
small blinds range will bet for example
just going by hand strength more ace
king than ace nine as an example
there is some two pair plus but this is
such a small portion of the range and in
fact let me navigate over to the ranges
tab just to demonstrate this
so this tab lets us compare both ranges
at the same time and you could say sure
small blind has more ace but
realistically the two pair plus is
proportionally about the same for both
players
in fact
if we take a look at the equity graph
although small blind has a range
advantage due to their top pair they do
not have that nut advantage near the top
here
and that's because everyone has all the
two pair here
and when small blind checks
well it gets a little worse for them so
in this spot ace two suited can make a
fine small bet but you have to ask
yourself what your range wants to do and
in general your range wants to play an
overbet strategy here ace2 does not fit
into an overbetting strategy it's uh
you'd be overplaying your hand you'd be
overextending so this hand much prefers
a check back when the rest of your value
is over betting with that said new guy
recognizes this checks back and we take
a king of club's turn so the king x is a
pretty good card for small blind and
that's because they should have a whole
lot of second pair and range right these
kx hands are less incentivized to bet
the flop therefore they should be here
in the checking line they also provide
support for small blinds middling hands
for example all of these middling pocket
pairs 7x 8x such that your stronger
hands you know ace king through ace 9 2
pair and such can go into a more
aggressive line without compromising the
strength of your checking range
and we can see that report here in the
turn reports i'm just going to sort by
cards
in general these broadway cards will
provide enough support to your middling
range such that you can start developing
some aggressive over betting strategies
some bricks are also overbet but the
range does not bet as frequently at all
in fact i can even change this over to
default
and sort by cards and let's just check
the expected value of different turn
cards for small blind and big blind
small blind is on the top in general
these broadway cards are going to hit
their range much better whereas the
middling and lower cards generally hit
big blinds range better
so as we can see bet is the preferred
strategy here and how is it constructed
well you've got a few trapped sets
plenty of two pair and top pair and of
course a ton of natural bluff candidates
gut shots open enders flush draws and
such so when i asked new guy about this
hand he told me that he thought the
small blind overbet was over bluff and
to arrive at that logic you'd have to
think how many natural value combos are
there how many natural bluffs are there
well there's a ton of natural bluffs
right
so many of these gut shots club draws
open enders
really just a ton of natural bluffs but
how much value is there well
ask yourself how often you think small
blind is checking the flop with a hand
like ace king or two pair hat
because
if they don't have these hands in range
then they're all they're left with is
the natural bluffs or like an overplayed
weak asex middling type hand so given
this read new guy figured that this
turnover bet line was over bluffed
and planned to call it down on most
runouts now obviously
top pair easy call in a turn you should
call all your top pair if you start
folding this you're folding too wide and
you can just get blasted off your equity
by bluffs you become exploitable even
second pair should be calling this over
bet particularly second pair that does
not block the natural love candidates
for example
king 2 doesn't block any of those gut
shots or open enders whereas king 10
does and will therefore have less equity
of course he makes an easy call and
we'll take a river
so the three of hearts is better for the
small blinds range and that's mostly
because a lot of their values such as
their you know medium strength top pair
can keep firing on this run out and if
we take a look at the ranges tab here
and just check the equity distribution
this blue line that small blinds range
is quite polarized meaning they have
very strong hands and very weak hands
this is because they've over bet the
turn whereas big blind's range is more
condensed towards medium hands they have
lots of bluff catchers
so facing this bet you have to ask
yourself what's a good call and we can
see that
a lot of two pair second pair third pair
even low pair all exist on this long
flat green line indicating they're all
very close to indifferent
we take a look at the strategy it is
mixing in calls with all of these hand
classes i think a lot of beginners would
just do something linear like continue
with top pair plus and fold the rest
because you know why would you call a
king facing this line
or why would you call you know anything
weak facing this line but you have to
ask yourself what your opponent is
bluffing with and what their value
betting this line is representing very
strong value
let's just take a look at what this is
supposed to represent for value
we have
sets two pair and only the very
strongest top pair in this line for
value and of course a ton of bricked
draws
so
you have to then ask yourself which
hands in between their bluffs and their
value are a bluff catcher of course
that's going to be
all of these and which of these lock
value and block bluffs well let's just
take a look at the top pair for example
and switch over to strategy plus ev ace
2 does not block bluffs ace 10 on the
other hand does block bluffs right you
know for example they're missed jack 10
or 10 9 or queen 10 so ace 2 is going to
be a higher eevee call in this situation
against a balanced opponent now if your
opponent is imbalanced then perhaps all
of these are going to be good calls
because they're all going to have the
correct pot outs
in fact even many of your weaker hands
which seem like natural folds will
become easy calls if your opponent is
over bluffing even slightly if they
don't have enough value
new guy recognizes this makes the call
and correctly scoops the pot and gets
shown the bluff really nice hand thank
you for the submission new guy here okay
let's move on to the next hand
this next hand comes to us courtesy of
pjj who's battling it out in the 25 and
l streets now it folds to him in the
small blind with ace 3 off and we'll
notice that they're quite deep
265 big blinds effective he opens it up
big blind makes the call and we get a
connected two-tone 678 board
the flop once again checks through jack
of clubs on the river and he goes for a
two-thirds pot bet okay
big blind calls the two of diamonds
river completes the flush and he puts in
a block bet interesting big line makes a
large raise and pjj three bets
representing the nut flush with his ace
of diamonds blocker big blind lays it
down and he scoops the pot so what do
you guys think of his hand was this line
justified and what do we think about the
three bet on the river cool line let's
dive into the analysis and take a look
so our hero pj opens it up in the small
blind with ace 3 off however he is
playing very deep stacked about 260 bigs
deep and as we go deeper well ace three
off actually becomes a pure fault
however it is a zero ev open it is
indifferent between opening and folding
same with ace four off same with many
hands in the small blind range to be
honest uh so you can't really fault the
guy for opening this hand
we can use something like ace four off
as a conduit in the meantime
generally speaking as you get deeper you
want to shift away from these hands
these offsuit hands that just try and
make a top pair and move towards more
suited stuff more connected stuff
something that can draw to something
strong realize it's equity well and has
good implied odds steep stack
so
he opens it up
big blind calls
and we'll take a flop
so this is a horrendous flop for small
blinds range as you can see they're
practically range checking despite being
the pre-flop aggressive and you should
ask why is this well
to answer that question let's go to the
ranges tab
i like to start with this equity
distribution
as you can see
they don't really have a nut or a range
advantage at all despite the fact that
they have all the over pairs in range
it's just not enough to compensate for
how bad this board is
uh let's just full screen this for a
second and here i've selected
eqr that's equity realization for both
players equity realization is a
measurement of performance it's the
expected value of your hand compared to
your pot share and so for example if we
just take a look at
ace 8 this hand has 62.3 equity
realization that means it's going to
claim only about 60 percent as much as
it would if the pot were checked down so
it's going to drastically underperform
as is most of your range
in general the positional advantage goes
up as stacks get deeper and so it is the
power of your draws so big blind having
position and more of these middling
cards
is generally going to favor their range
for that reason
small blind should check a lot so as not
to put themselves into a bad position on
later streets
pjj recognizes that this is a bad board
for his range and he checks
actions on big blind and in general they
should be using a lot of small to medium
sizes here preferring the 66 size uh
with a lot of their you know over pairs
two pairs sets straights and of course
an abundance of draws
they check it back and we'll take a turn
card
so on the turn the jack of clubs is a
fantastic card for your range that's
because it's going to hit a lot of these
top heavy cards that you have more of we
can see that the range advantage has
improved significantly so is the equity
realization and small blind is now ahead
in all metrics ev equity and realization
from the equity distribution graph we
can see they've developed a nice range
and nut advantage which is going to
allow them to lead aggressively
the strategy here is to check about 44
mixing in small bets mostly medium bets
and even some over bets as well
these medium bets are going to be
constructed a few straights sets
two pair over pair but mostly going to
be a lot of top pair for value
and we can see in the filters tab that
most of these made hands are going to be
doing betting right you're only going to
be checking about 20 of the time with
top pair plus on such a dynamic board
especially when you have enough nutted
hands to develop an aggressive attack
here from the reports tab
here i'm just going to group by cards
and i've selected the expected value we
can see that these larger cards you know
nines through ace tend to benefit the
small blinds range whereas the lower
cards generally benefit the big blinds
range which should make sense as we're
the pre-flop aggressor
so pjj leads out with ace four and the
next question is is this a good hand to
lead with well sorry he has ace three
but we'll use ace four as a conduit
generally
stuff with a diamond is what you want to
be betting with here when you have ace
high and if we just filter for
leading diamond combos
and ace high
and even king high
you can see that
these are going to be betting quite
aggressively as you block the diamonds
which means you're going to get more
folds it also means you can represent a
flush on later streets and your outs are
cleaner meaning you can hit top pair
without also completing villains flush
draws
so
pjj recognizes this is a decent card for
his range he likes his diamond blocker
he goes for the two-thirds size and
villain facing this size should be doing
a little bit of raising but mostly gonna
be just calling here
we can see what the thresholds are it's
important to identify you know what can
be folding here well you shouldn't be
folding 8x at this point this is too
early in a bvb situation you know the
threshold is going to be
some third pair
and lower pairs as well
something interesting that you might
notice
with the low pair is that it's folding
a lot of the uh
asex you know a6 and king six but it's
calling some of the lower stuff and
that's just because
these hands first of all block fewer
bluffs and second of all have more draw
potential
so
big blind makes the call and we'll take
a river
so we get the two of diamonds on the
river and here's where the fun starts so
pjj opts for a block bet in this spot
which seems decent
we can see that the block bet is going
to be mainly constructed
using top pair mixing in some stronger
hands and some bluffs the solver also
constructs
a
over betting strategy primarily composed
of straights and flushes in a few sets
and a
75 strategy with sets and over pairs the
block bet does seem good if we take a
look at ace four here we can see that
this hand in particular prefers a larger
bet typically the over bet or the
medium-sized bet and that's mostly
because you don't want to put too many
pure bluffs into a block pet line you
typically want to use very few bluffs
mostly medium hands and then just a few
traps however it can fit into this line
it's not a problem he goes for this
block bet size
actions on villain and as you can see
facing a blockbat villain should be
raising quite aggressively i'll just
group these together
and we could see that they should be
raising a good 21 percent of their range
mainly using flushes straights two pairs
and such and we can see that basically
all of their top pair underpairs second
pairs should mostly be calling
but
almost all of their two pair plus should
be raising
so villain raises it up
action's back on us and the silver here
is going to again
three bet
using flushes for value i'll just
separate those
and a mix of sizes and of course
anything with a diamond blocker in
particular can make an okay race right
x10 for example is an okay raise even
ace five is indifferent between raising
and folding and that's just because you
block the nuts the real problem is how
many of these you put into your range
it's very easy to get out of line with
way too many ace of diamond combos and
just be completely over bluffing then
again perhaps that's not a bad strategy
against the right villain type and after
this hand we're going to talk about some
of the exploitative adjustments
that he described in game so
facing this size he goes for this 85
percent
three bat strategy with the nut blocker
as you can see
big blind should be shoving here with a
decent chunk of
strong flushes
as well as some nut flush blockers
a lot of these asax hands for example
with the diamond blocker in the end big
blindfolds
and our hero pj takes it down with a
brave three bet on the river nicely
played so let's discuss some of the
interesting adaptations and exploits he
made in
and compare that to the strategy so the
first adjustment he made was pre-flop
obviously he opened a hand that isn't
technically an open but he's informed me
that according to his research the 25
and l pool does not raise nearly enough
facing this open big blind should be
raising something like 17 to 20 percent
of their range in this spot but if
they're not raising enough
then all of a sudden a lot of these
indifferent hands are these close
decisions become uh a pure open simply
because you're going to be able to
realize your equity
on the flop he did say that he sensed
this was probably
a range check spot although he wasn't
quite sure and he had expressed to me
that villain had some history and he
knows this guy likes to stab quite often
so he was quite surprised to see this
check back on the flop and therefore on
the turn expected villain's range to be
quite cap
so
the turn bet is somewhat exploitative in
that he thinks filling is not going to
be checking back enough of these strong
holdings
right sets straights two pairs
over pairs
a lot of these strong holdings
he just expects phil into bet which
would therefore increase the ev
of bluffing with ace four and that's
certainly a fine assumption if you think
villainous capped themselves and if so
you can even size up right you could
even go for an over bet line given that
they won't have enough nutted hands to
counter that strategy
on the river he expressed that he
thought villain's range would be quite
capped and almost any bet would be
profitable here and he said he wanted to
split his strategy between a small and a
large size he said that the smaller bet
might overperform because he thinks
villain will overfold to it relative to
the sizing which makes sense from an mdf
perspective
if you assume they're capped
facing the rays
he decided that he was going to three
bet any ace of diamonds because he
didn't think
villain would call
with the appropriate range and if we see
what villain is supposed to be calling
this three bet with
well we can take a quick look he is
actually indifferent with a bunch of
hands you know even some top pairs
two pairs sets straights a lot of hands
have to mix in calls in order to reach
the minimum defense frequency and if
they're not finding those you know raise
calls
uh it's going to be quite difficult to
defend properly of course one caveat is
that if villain is you know raising too
value heavy then of course this line
isn't as good but holding the nut flush
blocker does reduce a lot of his
strongest flushes in range so overall i
like his play and i like these
exploitative adjustments and i think you
played it pretty well thank you so much
for the submission pj nice hand and very
brave three bet on the river for the win
all right that's it for the video guys
we hope you enjoyed this content if
you'd like to see more like it some more
user submitted hand history analysis let
us know would be happy to do it again if
you want to discuss the theory please
join our discord link in the description
we love the chat theory there that's all
for now happy grinding
