### TOPIC: youre not bluffing enough in poker heres why
today I'm going to teach you a very powerful 
technique how to calculate value to Bluff ratios  
in poker this technique lets you understand 
how often you should be bluffing but also how  
often your opponents ought to be bluffing 
if they were balanced let's get started
many players learn the basic Bluff value ratios 
on the river but poker is not a one street game  
you're not just playing a river there are multiple 
betting streets and each Street compounds these  
effects allowing you to Bluff more and more 
often assuming you're using a polarized range  
so in today's lecture we're going to go over 
understanding the concept of indifference we'll  
talk about the theory of Leverage we'll talk about 
how to calculate value to Bluff ratios on the  
river and finally we're going to work backwards 
from the river and show you how this works in a  
multi-street game so that you can calculate these 
numbers on the turn and the Flop as well let's  
start by talking about indifference indifference 
in poker means that two actions have the same  
value for example if you have a bluff catcher 
that's right on the edge of the line facing a bet  
your hand might be indifferent between calling 
and folding if you have like a thin value hand  
it might be indifferent between checking and 
betting and all indifference means again is that  
two actions have the same value so the reason 
we understand indifference is to find balance  
and the goal of balance is not by itself to be 
balanced but rather to understand where the line  
is to understand what balanced play looks like in 
a vacuum when you understand where the line is you  
have a baseline from which to deviate if your 
opponents are for example not bluffing enough  
or bluffing too much and in contrast you'll also 
see where your own leaks might be to understand  
Bluff to Value ratios we need to understand 
how to solve a basic polarized River toy game  
so here Hero has Ace Ace or queen queen they 
have value or Bluff villain holds a bluff catcher  
there's a half pot bet we can either shove or 
give up with our queen queen sometimes so what  
is our best strategy to solve this is pretty 
straightforward of course we always want to  
Value BET our essays and we need to Bluff enough 
to prevent villain from always folding otherwise  
their value hands don't get paid off at the 
same time if we Bluff too much then they can  
snap call all the time and now we're losing too 
much money with our Bluffs so the correct amount  
of Bluffs sits somewhere in between if you do 
the math you'll find that the correct Bluff  
percentage on the river is always equal to the 
pot odds laid in this example we're betting half  
pot what that means is that villain is getting 
plot odds of 25 they need at least 25 percent  
equity in order for their kings to break even 
after calling if we Bluff less than 25 percent  
well in that case they can always fold and if 
we blow up from more than 25 percent then they  
should always call now in practice you're 
never going to get this just right you know  
who knows exactly how often you're bluffing in 
every spot but you can develop a sense for it  
a really simple way to go about this on the river 
anyway is to Simply use a pot odds chart so we've  
got this one here on the left hand side you'll see 
the BET size as a percentage of the pot and on the  
right hand side you'll see the value to Bluff 
construction and so for example for a half pot  
bets we see that 75 percent of our betting range 
should be value and 25 percent of our betting  
range should be Bluffs and that's again because 
they need 25 Equity to break even on a call and  
therefore if a quarter of our Ranger Bluffs 
then we make them indifferent between calling  
and folding and you'll notice something here the 
larger we bet the more Bluffs we could use so if  
you bet 150 pot well in that case villain has 
let's see they need somewhere like 37 38 equity  
to call us bats and therefore a larger proportion 
of our betting range can be Bluffs now keep in  
mind that this is assuming a perfectly polarized 
toy game where our value hands are always the  
nuts and our Bluffs always lose in reality your 
opponent might have some traps and that's going  
to limit how big you can bet because you don't 
want to bet so large that you're only getting  
action from the few traps they have right so 
returning to the toy game our value percentage  
should be 75 percent our Bluff percentage should 
be 25 percent which matches the pot odds for a  
half pot bet conversely villain should call 
according to the minimum defense frequency  
which in this case is two-thirds of the time okay 
let's see if you were paying attention here's a  
quiz for you fill in bets seven big lines into 
a 10 big blind pot on the river you shove for 25  
big blinds what is the optimal value to Bluff 
ratio take a moment to consider your answer
[Music] thank you the answer is B 70 value 30 
percent Bluffs that's how often we should be  
value betting when we check raise shove the river 
so the way you work this out is you calculate the  
pot outs of your shove how do you calculate pot 
odds well the equation is simply the amount they  
have to call divided by the parts after they call 
so they need to call 25 minus 7 because they've  
already bet seven so 18 more big blinds and the 
pawn after they call is 60 biplines 18 over 60  
gives us thirty percent and therefore we they need 
exactly 30 Equity to call now if you imagine that  
we're raising the river with only nutted hands 
that always beat their value and Bluffs that  
always lose to their calls well in that case we 
need exactly seventy percent value okay let's talk  
about the theory of Leverage Leverage is a really 
interesting concept now this idea has been known  
for a long time the way that these Bluff to Value 
ratios work this has been known since mathematics  
of Poker I first learned it from applications 
of No Limit Hold'em by Shonda but Andrew brocos  
one of our writers hero wrote about it in his 
book play optimal poker and he describes this  
phenomenon as leverage and Leverage is this 
compounding effect of you can use more Bluffs  
on earlier streets as the bluffed Valley ratio 
compounds and so the way he words it Leverage  
is the additional value gained from betting hands 
that you anticipate profitably betting on future  
streets so hands that can bet multiple streets 
as part of a polarized range benefit the most  
from Leverage especially deep stacked if you want 
to learn more about leverage we have this article  
what is leverage in poker Link in the description 
it's a good intro to this concept let me give  
you an example of Leverage so imagine that you're 
playing a hand and you have a static Bluff catcher  
facing a pot sized bet on the turn your opponent 
is using a range of 20 nuts to 10 Bluffs so two  
to one how often should you call their turn 
bet take a moment to consider your answer
[Music]
surprisingly the answer is zero you should 
actually just fold everything and this I think  
is going to be more surprising to the people that 
already kind of understand this topic because if  
you look at the actual numbers they have two 
value bets for every Bluff and a pot sized bet  
lays what pot odds two to one so if we only look 
at the immediate pod odds we are getting pot odds  
to call this bet and yet the best move is to 
always fold why is that well the answer is that  
villain is under bluffing because it's not just 
a pot sized bet you see let's think about this  
they have a range of two to one value to Bluff 20 
knots to ten Bluffs we have static Bluff catchers  
that is to say Bluff catchers that always beat 
Bluffs and always lose the value can't improve  
there's a pot sized bed behind on the river 
what this means is that villain can always  
bet the river right because they have the correct 
value to Bluff ratio to pot the turn and then pot  
again on the river and so essentially we're not 
facing a pot sized bet we are facing a pod sized  
bet and another pot sized bet for a total of like 
effective 400 pot and so what ends up happening is  
we are risking essentially four hundred dollars to 
win 500 if we call down both bets starting with a  
100 pot for this reason they actually need to be 
bluffing more often on the turn and this is the  
concept of Leverage without draws or implied odds 
or any of those other abstract terms the simple  
ability to bet twice with a polarized range or 
bet three times allows you to apply leverage now  
what I'd like to do next is visualize the money 
but I can't quite do that just yet first I need  
to teach you guys about a misconception in poker 
you've probably heard this idea that the Eevee  
of folding is equal to zero well this is a fine 
way to look at it it's just a convention we use  
to make the math easier you see other reference 
points are also useful in fact what most solvers  
do is they don't use EV equals zero they use the 
expected value of actions is equal to the start  
of your stack at the start of a hand minus your 
stack at the end of a hand so let me give you an  
example of what that might look like this was one 
of the first articles I wrote for GTO Wizard and  
it's called what is expected value in poker and 
over here I wrote a section about EV relativity  
and so here's an example let's say that you three 
bet Ace Queen suited on the big blind and you face  
a four bet from the button you can either fold 
call or shove now if we check the expected value  
of Ace Queen Suited we can see the expected value 
of folding is zero calling is four and shoving is  
2.5 and so calling is the best action however this 
is not the expected value we actually get from a  
silver from a silver it actually calculates this 
assuming that your three bet was to 11 big blinds  
and so again we're choosing between three options 
and trying to choose the best option which in this  
case is calling but the actual amount of money 
you'll make relative to your stack is losing about  
seven big blinds on average now why am I teaching 
you this because using a common reference point is  
really useful for understanding multi-street EV 
calculations this concept of folding equals zero  
EV is is great for one street calculations but it 
kind of fails miserably when you're trying to do  
EV calculations over multiple streets and so you 
need to kind of let that idea go and use a fixed  
reference points for your EV calculations if you 
want to calculate multiple streets of betting so  
with that EV perspective in mind let's now 
visualize the money because a lot of people  
don't understand how you can face a balanced bet 
on the turn and yet it's a bad call so let's take  
a look here we'll start on the left hand side 
it's a 100 pot a 400 stack and villain bets a  
hundred dollars on the turn we can either call or 
fault if we call villain will always bet the river  
if we call again and we win we'll win 500 that 
is the starting stack so villain stack plus the  
pot if we call and lose we'll lose our 400 stack 
now conversely if we call the turn and then fold  
the river we'll lose our turn call which is a 
hundred dollars and the final option is to just  
fold immediately on the turn and lose zero so this 
is our fixed reference point let's calculate how  
much money each line makes and so if we calculate 
our equity on the river it turns out to be minus  
a hundred dollars and so one-third times 500 plus 
two-thirds times 400 gives us a minus one hundred  
dollar River call conversely folding is also worth 
minus one hundred dollars and so we're indifferent  
between two minus one hundred dollar decisions on 
the river and you see the problem is that they'll  
always bet the river so if we trace the decision 
back back back to our turn call we'll see that the  
best option was actually just to fold immediately 
and never see a river to begin with and so this  
begs the question why do we ever call down with a 
static Bluff catcher well how often should villain  
actually be bluffing the turn for this to make 
sense and so let's add another diagram and this  
time we've given villain a give up range and these 
are hands that will bet the turn and then give up  
on the river when this happens we're going to win 
the pots a hundred dollars plus their turn bet  
so a grand total of 200 and if this happens often 
enough we can recuperate our turn bet again if we  
calculate the expected value we find that we need 
them to give up on the river at least a third of  
the time and bet again two-thirds of the time and 
in fact the math works out such that their give  
up frequency on the river should be equal to our 
pod odds on the turn regardless of the bat size  
and so that's how you actually recuperate your 
money with a static Bluff catcher you recuperated  
through villain giving up on later straights and 
a villain is not giving up on later straights that  
tells you that either a they're over bluffing 
they're just not taking their foot off the gas  
pedal or B they were under bluffing to begin with 
and never needed to slow down because they were  
too nitty to start with okay so you understand 
how to calculate these value to Bluff ratios for  
one street and we've seen the power of Leverage 
now it's time to understand how this extends to  
multiple streets so how often should villain be 
bluffing the turn if ten Bluffs wasn't enough  
remember the stack the Pod ratio is four we're 
facing a pot sized turn bet and there's another  
pot sized bet behind on the river and villain 
starts with 20 nut combos how many turn Bluffs  
do they need in order to be balanced on the turn 
take a moment to consider your answer [Music]  
the answer is D 55 in fact they should be bluffing 
more often than their value betting on the turn in  
order for us to have a break even call with our 
Bluff Catcher And so this brings us back to the  
power of Leverage here I've graphed the value to 
Bluff ratio on the Flop turn and river and we can  
see they can use more Bluffs in the Flop than 
they can in the turn than they can on the River  
on each Street we expect them to give up with a 
portion of their Bluffs and bet such that they're  
balanced by the river how do they construct their 
strategy let's walk through this step by step with  
an example so again let's imagine this time that 
we're hero and we're the polarized player holding  
either a value bet or a bluff and just pretend 
that our value bets will always be value at our  
Bluffs will always be Bluffs and their Bluff 
catchers will always be Bluff catchers we start  
with eight knotted hens and 37 total combinations 
so 29 of those combinations are bluffs we're going  
to fill out this table together to show you how 
to calculate value to Bluff ratios over multiple  
Straits so first of all in a perfectly polarized 
toy game you always want to bet your value hands  
so our value hands always bet flop turn and 
River and the reason for this is that there's  
no reason to trap if you don't have any Showdown 
value so in this case if we check why would they  
bet just to fold out our Bluffs and get called 
by any traps now betting does nothing for them  
so there's no reason for us to trap or to protect 
that range so we're always going to bet our value  
Okay so we've got that column figured out what 
about the bluff column well we know on the river  
that and again we're using a pot pot so we're 
potting all three straights on the river we should  
be bluffing half as often as we're value betting 
we want to use two to one two value bets for every  
one Bluff and so we already know this column but 
how often we should we be giving up well a give up  
percentage is equal to odd odds laid on the turn 
and so odds laid for a pot sized bet so 33 percent  
so we should be giving up a third of our range 
on the river and that works out to six so six  
over eighteen is one third a third of the time we 
give up now that we know how many Bluffs we have  
on the river we know how many Bluffs we have on 
the turn six plus four is ten and again our give  
up range should be such that we're giving up a 
third of the time on the turret which works out  
to nine and again ten plus nine that's nineteen 
and that leaves the remaining 10 give UPS on  
the Flop and so we can already figure out with if 
we just know the total number of nuts and Bluffs  
how often we should be value betting and bluffing 
on each Street let's visualize that on the right  
hand side we can see a flow chart that shows how 
often we're value betting and bluffing each Street  
as well as our give UPS now why did we 
calculate all this what is the point  
well the ultimate goal is very simple we 
just want to get our value bets paid off  
as often as possible without becoming 
exploitable by over bluffing and so we  
arrive at the river with a perfectly balanced 
range of eight value bets to every four Bluffs  
well simultaneously giving up just often enough 
Reven villain from snap folding earlier so the  
entire purpose of this strategy is to get your 
value bets paid off as much as possible now you  
may be asking yourself this is based on Three Pot 
sized bets however you can calculate this for any  
batch size it's actually relatively simple now I 
have a simple spreadsheet application here caveman  
GTO calculator you might have seen from some of 
my earlier work but I've never actually explained  
how this works the math is fairly straightforward 
so for a perfectly polarized range that is to say  
value bets always win Bluffs always lose the value 
betting percentage is just one minus the product  
of the Pod odds so for example in the river one 
minus the river pot odds is equal to the amount  
of value you should have right if you bet pots 
on the river you're laying pot odds that dictate  
33 Bluffs and therefore two-thirds value and so 
you can multiply it out for example in the turn  
you can multiply out one minus the turnpot odds 
multiplied by one minus the River Products and  
that gives you the percentage of value that 
you should be betting with on the turn and  
same thing for the Flop just the product of one 
minus pod odds pretty straightforward calculation  
so let me show you the caveman GTO calculator next 
okay this is a pretty basic application again we  
can enter any set of bet sizes here so 67 89 
152 uh it'll just calculate this out for you  
so let's just go over the assumptions that we're 
making here we assume that villain can only call  
or fold which again if we're perfectly polarized 
there they would have no reason to raise we assume  
that Equity is static that we're balanced and 
that there are no blocker effects so this is a  
a nice simple toy game I've also included 
sections here to add the equity of your  
Bluffs and value bets and this is a calculation 
that Janda did in his work applications of No  
Limit Holdem in my experience this actually does 
not work out well because the way he models it  
he models a bluff for example having 20 
Equity meaning that it always has 20 percent  
no matter how much you narrow the opponent's 
range or conversely if you have value bets  
he would model that as this always has 
eighty percent no matter how much we  
narrow the opponent's range which 
isn't really the case in reality  
so I'm not actually going to use that I'm just 
going to use perfectly polarized equity and here  
we can see the value to Bluff ratios on flop turn 
and River and so let's enter our pot pot toy game
and here we can see the appropriate value to 
Bluff ratio says we should be bluffing quite  
a lot on the Flop less so on the turn and less 
so on the river now next I'd like to show you  
how this actually works in GTL Wizard and we'll 
compare the idealized caveman toy game to what  
the solver thinks we should be doing but before 
we do that we need to address the elephant or  
rather the cow in the room you see the cow is a 
sphere but what this means is that we're trying  
to represent an extremely complex topic which is 
Nash equilibrium in poker in an almost infinite  
game space with a super basic toy game model and 
this doesn't really match reality our Equity is  
not static Bluffs and value is a false dichotomy 
on earlier straights and we can't perfectly plan  
out bet sizes we can't just pretend that we know 
exactly what bet size we're going to use and we  
can't pretend that we don't have Showdown value 
in some of these lines this is not how actual poke  
Works obviously however the reason we represent 
the cow as a sphere in physics and the reason  
we use oversimplified models in engineering 
to represent more complex topics is because  
it allows us to understand the inner mechanics 
behind how stuff works and once you understand  
those inner mechanics you can extrapolate those 
ideas and Abstract them to more complex spots to  
spots that cannot be calculated with standard 
handwritten calculations as you could with  
this toy game and so by using simplified models 
like this we can understand spots more deeply  
and understand this idea of Leverage and Bluff 
to Value ratios compounding on a better level  
so without further Ado let's open GTA Wizard and 
see how the solver applies these Concepts now the  
beauty of this is that it works for all formats 
MTT cash heads up Spin and goes you name it the  
the math is universal throughout poker so I've 
got three examples here we'll look at an MTT  
spot first at 35 big blind steep for this first 
example I've chosen a hijacked versus button spot  
so hijack opens the button calls Bob is 
Queen five for rainbow I jack see bets  
and we get a raise in position this is going 
to give us a pretty polarized line that will  
match our toy game model quite well eject 
calls turn is the Deuce of Clubs Daryl
a jack calls again and on the river 
we ship it in for the last 40 pot  
now when button shoves hijack has 22 pod odds 
22 Equity all and therefore button should be  
bluffing 22 percent of the time just go over 
to the ranges tab look at the equity buckets  
see at 22 percent of buttons 
shoving range contains Bluffs  
exactly what we expect going to our toy game model 
typing at the BET sizes here so raise 33 percent  
on the Flop Barrel 55 on the turn shove 40 on 
the river and again we see a ratio of about 78.22  
on the river Shelf what about the turn how closely 
does that match if we just go back to the turn  
after we've put in the 55 bet I just select the 
best and the good hands that button is barreling  
with see that 58 of their turn betting range 
contains value bets again our tour game model says  
57 pretty darn close lastly if I go over to the 
flop after button has raised and this time instead  
of equity buckets let's use hands is and this may 
be a little easier to Define this as the value bet  
what does it say 48 so about 48 of buttons flop 
raising range should contain value BET our toy  
gay model predicts 46 percent pretty darn close 
all right for this next example we're going to  
take a look at a cutoff versus big blind 200 big 
blind deep cash game so cutoff opens and big blind  
calls see a queen 4 Deuce rainbow flop cut off 
cvet's third pot and the big blind hits him with  
a pot sized check race representing sets two pair 
and top pair cut off calls Knight of Hearts turn  
and the big blind continues to Barrel 
referring this 125 over bet size
cut off calls river is the Queen 
of Hearts pairing the top card  
and the big blind ships it in 
representing a whole lot of boats  
so after the big land shubs there's a little 
thing here we've just added this feature this  
shows your pod odds and so the cutoff's 
Pod odds facing this shove are 38 percent  
going back to the start of the lecture what 
does that tell you well it tells you that  
about 38 of the big Blends shoving range should 
contain Bluffs and that's exactly what we see  
just select all of these bluffy hens at 38 percent
or we can select the value hens about 60 to 
63 percent so let's go over to our caveman  
GTO calculator to see if it agrees with us we 
check raised Parts on the Flop over bet the  
turn and shipped it in on the river so on the 
river we would expect about 62 percent value  
and that's exactly what we see now again it's 
not going to be perfect because there's some  
minor blocker effects but this is pretty 
darn close so let's go back to the turn  
we've overbed 125 action on cutoff and I'm 
just going to select our value hands here  
so again these sets these two pairs these are 
clearly value uh the only other question is  
does top pair count as value and so if we 
include these we have Queen Seven Queen six  
Queen five Queen three some very marginal top 
hair weak kicker hands as a merged bet and so  
then we'd have 43 percent value bets and if you 
don't include some of those then it's closer to  
37 value bets so somewhere between 37 and 43. and 
if we go over here we expect in an idealized toy  
game about 40 Value so lastly going over to the 
Flop after we've check raised pot we can select  
let's say top pair plus as our value region it 
gives us about 30.7 uh if you don't count some of  
the mergy top pair then it's maybe closer to like 
25 percent and that's exactly what we see here  
now you'll notice something else we're very deep 
in this spot which means that the big blind can  
over bet twice and this means that they can 
Bluff more we can see that they only need about  
a quarter of their range to be value bets on the 
Flop check raise so the deeper you are the more  
important the nut Advantage becomes because you 
can polarize much harder when you're able to bet  
much bigger and that also means that a larger 
portion of your range can start Bluff racing  
relative to the number of value hands you have 
okay for our last example we have a heads up sit  
and go 25 picked lines deep the small blind starts 
with a two big blind open and yes I know if you  
haven't seen heads up sit and go Solutions there 
is a lot of limping in position that is just part  
of the strategy so they open big blind calls 
and we get a low connected flop six for deuce  
the aggressor C bets and the big blind again 
check raises and I'm showing you a lot of  
raising lines because these are quite polarized 
and will closely match our toy game models uh  
whereas here it's very hard to tell where 
the Bluffs end and the value bets begin so  
they raise and we got an another low 
connected card this time the five of clubs  
which is actually pretty good for the big blinds 
Check Racing line they have a lot of these low  
cards this hits their check race well so they 
continue to Barrel this time two-thirds pot  
and we get an ace on the river and so the big 
blind shoves it in with a good portion of their  
range representing mostly straights or nothing 
now let's take a look at the value to bet ratio  
so on the river again I'm going to use the ranges 
Tab and we're going to use well let's just say  
straights and maybe two pairs two pair value bet 
it's hard to say uh about 70 72 percent equity  
that's approximately how many value bats they 
should be using on the river let's see what our  
toy game model says check raise 33 on the Flop 
65 cbat on the turn 59 on the river okay so on  
the river we expect about 73 value bets okay that 
makes sense for this size this is the Pod odds for  
a 60 pot size bed and yeah this is exactly what we 
see now on the turn we would expect to see about  
52 value bets so let's go back here we'll head 
over to the turn so we've barreled the turn Barrel  
and again let's just use I don't know two pair and 
straights as the value portion of this C bet which  
comes out to about 50 49.4 call that 50 percent 
value bets on the turn for this bet size and yeah  
here it says 52 so our toy game model predicts 
slightly more value but the fact is we also block  
a lot of the straights when we have a straight 
so that changes the calculation a bit but we're  
ignoring card removal in our simplified model and 
finally on the Flop we expect about 42 value bets  
here if we go back to the flop okay and 
we say what are we check raising with  
well let's see top pair two pair of sets all 
of these hands so let's say top Hair Plus is  
our value region that's about 39 of our overall 
check raising value range and here it predicts 42  
percent so reasonably close and you can see this 
concept of Leverage is applied to all of these  
scenarios and especially when I'm you know cherry 
picking these very polarized lines this toy game  
model works very well and so the real takeaway 
here is that you need to be bluffing more on  
earlier straights giving up portion of your range 
and knowing that just because you have direct pot  
odds to call doesn't actually mean that you should 
be calling in fact you should be bluffing quite a  
lot more on earlier straights and so should your 
opponents and if you're playing against people  
that aren't doing that well you know what to do 
let's summarize so Leverage is the phenomenon  
of compounding pot odds over multiple streets 
and the result is that you should have more  
flop Bluffs than turn Bluffs than River Bluffs 
now if you're a cash game player who's mainly  
playing 100 big blinds in single race Parts you 
can use the one-third one-half two-thirds rule  
this is a simple rule of thumb that tells you 
approximately what portion of your range should  
be value bets on flop turn and River your static 
Bluff catchers recover their calls when villain  
gives up and so a villain is not giving up often 
enough your static Bluff catchers won't recuperate  
their calls and so you should probably start over 
folding those especially if your opponents are too  
value heavy the give up percentage that is to say 
the proportion of range that someone should give  
up after bluffing is approximately equal to the 
previous Street Pawn out so if someone bets pot on  
the turn with a polarized range they should give 
up approximately pod odds of the time on the river  
so about a third of the time if they were to bed 
for example half pots on the turn then you would  
expect them to give up about a quarter of the time 
on the river and that's ultimately how you recover  
the previous Street call and finally if villain 
isn't giving up enough they're unbalanced in some  
way so either they're you know balanced on the 
turn but then they're over bluffing the river or  
they're under bluffing the turn and then directly 
bluffing the river or somewhere in between there  
but it is impossible to be balanced if they don't 
have give ups and so a lot of old school poker  
theories said you know you should just never 
give up with a bluff if you're going to Bluff  
just pull the trigger all the way through well 
that might be fine exploitative advice sometimes  
it disagrees directly with Game Theory which says 
you actually need give UPS in order to achieve a  
balanced range check out the articles in the 
description for more information I'll post a  
link there about leverage as well as the caveman 
GTO calculator so you can read that if you want  
to learn more about these Concepts if you have 
any questions if you need something clarified

to hear from you and as always happy grinding
