The villain, described as balanced, is likely to have a strong range that includes many overpairs and strong broadway combinations. Hero's hand, while a pocket pair, is vulnerable to overcards and has limited equity against the villain's range. Given the significant range and nut advantage for the villain, combined with the pot-sized bet indicating strength, folding is the most prudent action to avoid playing a large pot with a marginal hand.\n</s>]]> </s>]]> </s>]]>\n</s>]]>\n</s>]]>\n</s>]]>\n</s>]]>\n</s>]]>\n</s>]]>\n</s>]]>\n</s>]]>\n</s>]]>\n</s>]]>\n</s>]]>\n</s>", "recommended_action": "fold"}}
